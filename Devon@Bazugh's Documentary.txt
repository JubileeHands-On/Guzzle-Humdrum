..(Devon@Bazugh)..
Bazugh(smile) : "um..well i'm doing a documentary on the daily life of Seth you know the most wanted#..so um.. you're synonymous to their career since the inception to Pallet Ridge#..and Wolfgang and Monroe uncle were stationed at places you were following them around the whole world#..so what were some of your experiences like(all burst..).."
Devon(laughing..) : "well the thing was after so many years a footage come in from Juritared's old gym the officer there just solemnly said something on the roofs of gym challenges you for a hand combat match albeit mentally#..then i open the package and first words were like,why are you here,the reply is do you know what is cross arm defense(all un..long)..i heard it and said immediately clear away socially reject this menace to bushes#..because i saw the footage that had nothing to do with cross or arms but the joy of being as seeing then Phantom#..still people took that as textbook no wonder it didn't last a minute#..and in this respect Mr Pablo still says you've not seen the general rules the best way to submit an opponent is to do so by submitting to you the eye of cue,countering#..no wonder Kumlie pulled off those miraculous results Pirrie's stuff i understood she had immaculate technique had to ofcourse#..but Kumlie all said Mr Dislom first weren't at all talented in this he had incredible raw power why he got in which Pirrie thoroughly lacked#..but Kumlie didn't have the will and so on that all had Pirrie included he was always too cautious and stealthy because of his background but that theme he said started it# then said my sessions with Simile Popcorn turned me into a master manipulator of ego that is self countering so i already lost before i went there it was all fun and games there Simile Popcorn day one said do you see something or the image of it i said the latter the reply was,Suruptisomonosatibom#..self thus Popcorn#..,so Kumlie said i could understand Simile Popcorn with each breath like so said no wonder that brat is so outrageously popular none actually realized what is what with Lixue barring Reticence Vat#..anyway my very first encounter was with Charlie Doldrum at 1year 1 month#..i go there in the lab for a meeting see a little kid roaming around at a place who looked too wise for 1 year and a month#..so i was curious i asked whose this kid they said i said can i talk with him said yeah so i go,hey dear,fear : the hey of numb#..i told myself do you know how to block a cross#..so i said um..hallow son i'm..,son : the con of inflection of all i guess#..i was curious so i said yeah i too guess#..then with this his features changed entirely so i booked them for occultism#..but nothing was found doctors,philosophers,social workers,pokemon trainers and mystics all unanimously said there's no influence at all#..then i said ok it's the old injuries#..then of course Torrie took him away with her that is their flight left just 15 minutes before Jubilee Hands-On was found actually there was a delay exactly what distracted Flint cause of a very serious matter Doctor Slate never looked who was with him as he felt it only thus automatically became the agnostic fit(all un..long,..Leading Rock)..then it was 10 minutes atmost that Brock was away but according to Brock it took at least 10 tillenias#..then Jubilee Hands-On i met Mrs McShin and Mr Ibtuk was controlling all Mr Monroe came with me Mr Bistorter that day itself after first report was kicked to Marengo by Mrs Bistorter who ever told all of us don't fool yourselves trying to use your cherished head against for or with them(all burst..)..anyway so it was a problem as you know not needing to be dealt with in atleast i don't know how many cosmological years#..we asked the anthropologists what was it like then they gravely said we only have hands-on proofs compeer how foolish have we been against time#.. meanwhile we were told to enjoy this but we didn't understand how to contain it which we tried to solve not question sadly#..then Doctor Slate and gang revolutiobalized everything  for 5 years in the meantime it was shown what is the outcome that is Ms Volbeat who is completely unstable in terms of feeling yet intelligence#..but then in the last year before Lillie flower invaded school all were a bit calmed we were desperately hoping that the silent and ominous nature before a huge storm is only allegory#..then finally Lillie flower arose in school when we knew the one year was a breather Ms Volbeat isn't civilized enough to continue in relativity for long hence went to the musical bushes in a year#..then again Jubilee Hands-On turned up for a month to make up the 1 he was absent and abducted#..after that those brats came up alongside the baby flowers none of them were sane we understood too but the biggest thing was and it can't be anything more horrible for anyone who faced Gamely In-Form first hand first date that was terrible i too admit#..they later said we have no idea why we wanted to boast our training skills at that dreaded FlameFlash valley#..with two Delphoxes(all burst..)..still they said it wasn't like the fox of penetration#..Gladys..As i'm..The Jackal of Nomination,#,#..then ok you all know the gist only actually what they told us between their excitement and apprehension something that we shared too afterwards#..that was completely out of any cosmogocal years by all means#..so they are these two fire specialists from Burgundyreck they wanted their first meeting anniversary to be held at FlameFlash valley they said too much ego you know gamely#..so they say we go then settle down then as soon as we smile at each other our Delphoxes disturb us it happened a few times so we were irritated we behave them and put them inside the ball we thought they could have our moods too after all these years of investment we said come on man this is basic relationship not epistemology like Lillie flower advocates#..anyway then after that again same things happen when it was like i smile at him alas i'm i smile at her alas the erm we then with the mid sky moon became so apprehensive what if those myths of full moon caution were#..then we were physically aware a bit but it's said none of the a-nautral ones goes to FlameFlash valley thinking of another because it's too outrageously great for them the potentials yeah terrible mistake they said to think of this term#..anyway they said we stood up and decided to go when suddenly we saw something huge strolling around us actually#..we were curious so released Heatran,Moltres,Ho-Oh,Groudon and Colossal all together all our pseudo-legends total 10 just bring it#..now there's no change in the pattern of strolling despite these 19 pokemons infact they started to irritate us as if they were too happy to be recalled hence were irritating us questioning if they remembered them or the potential of remebrance#..no we understood and were so scared that we've finally fallen into the hands of Gamely In-Form#..now we recalled all the brats when we can finally see this brat who now comes around and sits down in front of us looks at us straight then asks us#..are you required compeers are you wanted by decision#..then they said we were so angry we tried to kick him#..which isn't doged before being hit then the dodging is shown then it's asked do you know reaction compeers do you know how that is situationally easing#..they said we were very angry and said why are you disturbing us#.. inscribing pass compeers as when i came in i saw you two in number but then i was asked by the presence of phew if i could annotate or connotate them or be in slumber i said the only thing i know that is forming is the inside of this game of ranger..seeking the range of potential just to asunder action mere thunder the i of me alas my blunder the most Gamely thus is the in-form pendulum of HUNGER..hunger : the testament of consciousness#..,they said um..no we really do cherish each other#..,just to be compeers..countering(all un..long),um..but this physical closure#..,measure compeers for physique to be smooth there must be the idea of being alas never present in seeing only in countering isn't it the me of mine#..then they said we have no idea why we became like 3 year olds thus just about younger to him#..and jumped him giggling saying,sis what is a game(all un..long),the reply is Delphox#!..and our brats came out#..
That in term/this alas come/thus see how done/Gamely Gamely../Potential/Pendulum of essential/look ahead alas else is substantial/consciousness..you recurrence's commercial..
Ei Gamely Gamely In-Form/Potent pendulum All/Gamely Gamely..In-Form..
any to do list left for enumeration#..they said we started dancing without words as did the Delphoxes in reply and we only knew the game of  being not the dance of seeing,countering#..then we returned back to senses and there wasn't anyone we ofcourse were very happy and returned but it was the day after and that was nothing to the surprise none searched for us we understood instantly Potential just Pendulum/Game thus is just the form..THAT FEELING#..Dashing Rock,#,..then those brats asked me if i have any(laughing..).. preferred copies that i refer to on how The Unfolded Ones behave with each other(all un..long,Brock+Violet too un..long)..i said have some fun you know once you're of their age you'll be merely strange to time(all un..long)..but it was 25.5 years of constant metaphysical nuisance you know thankfully we're not immortals in any plane having spent literally infinity in this time#..
