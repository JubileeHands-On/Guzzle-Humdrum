),anyway lets go back to Melody and Melody this was just after her break-up too cause the brat was desperate to get a new beau as the previous one dumped her(all laugh)...this I came to know from the moods(all laugh)..and so on,Melody is as simple a girl as one comes across,and all because we were talking for 9 years by then may be 6 times a month for 9 minutes max cause she was the extra help later along with Sabrina,too good with psychic types as was Belly with waters and I’ve met many in Unova far better than these but these two could surprize you suddenly with sudden tremendous intuition which Mehu herself can’t do and those two were exactly like me in style Melody though no more in profession and I’m only happy for that cause it never helped her after that final victory but I spoke with her most cause first she came up with impossible intuitions and Sabrina was 7 times per week 17/18 minutes the least by all means(all laugh) you may know about Mrs Olympia Sydons from Opastrakar,Unova hall of fame huge name in my contact and she is exactly Mehu with psychic/ghost/dark and she receives 9.5minutes 6 times as well(all laugh) just too good and I’m in contact with almost all gym leaders in Kalos and Unova(all laugh) those who really were great and wated that many actually was thet I humiliated them and all but Unova now you know different story and Mrs Olympia was saved cause she gagued the situation well but the one man Mr Daquan from () that I have no contacts with cause he is just a too great man for me to even ask anything and the whole world knows him and he will be back to joviality next term getting prepared only and he wasn’t contacted cause he said distinctly that you have got nothing to learn from me cause I’m nothing to you and you I’ll remember in 1000 years as only once I saw cause to be honest you may get to the bushes and thus lose it I don’t want that and thus only by luck I’ll meet when you may return for your Elite4 and I just want to remember this moment and that’s all I’ve got nothing to learn from you cause I’ll do it 1000 years later remind me then only he paved my way to cut off my ego and was single whole life lived at a totally different sphere ever told them legends can only be befriended his Latios was trying to do that with Chu just not enough and all and he will return as the great Jovial pokemon master once in 2322 and that’s who he is so later I visited during a Sunday in Elite4 first thing I did after that Kalos incident had some chats on philosophy and all so much to learn told him about my 3 classes there and then I wated to live such a life he said many unbelievable things and all and just wated to see Chu who was serious but then I showed Giratina whom he had and that joviality I told he said that was even better than 1000 and he was so happy that he could see that cause he ever thought that was possible and will see that later he said had many things to say and me too was abstract though both of us and was a grand experience and the whole reason I went to Unova and will do so again but this time with Mehu if he asks to had he been here but had he been here he would’ve just called me and gave forced them to get full general govt support so that the humans were taken care of the rest is too easy would’ve never been undercover except the general Unovan govt themselves being involved had he been consulted with and you know that means Mehu would’ve been assured that I will return and could contact me every day cause no battle would’ve taken place anyway coming to Melody I ever felt an affection for her later especially now I realize that she was May absolutely just way more frank,nice and jovial her unnecessary friendliness to me after Johto and all was may be she wanted to travel with me at Hoenn or something I don’t know but ever was too friendly with me to nice in I was at Hoenn and she Kalos ever said can’t concentrate I ever told her just focus on your bunch and I didn’t have a clue that Kalos is the grand Kalos and neither did she else would’ve been at Hoenn or Sinnoh atleast or even Unova which is still better than Kalos and may be she needed more help I feel bad for her in that way but anyway Melody was like that and this 54-57 minutes/month still believed me that I was a good friend despite my outer attitude,so said that when I was in Unova still and my show offs to her had nothing to do with our relation cause she was first hand victim of those brats att both places so she was fine and all else just a hesitation except many though like Ingfred never had that being from Kanto,Mr Rosen at Johto psychic gym never,Mr Houston at Sinnoh a fire gym never,Kent Ground gym Hoenn never,Virginia from Kalos of all places that too rock type gym of all gyms where I used Hawlucha(all laugh) still even there never bothered and there most thought I was so egotistical and all Valentina says just the air gets a bit heavy if your bunch wants to play and not battle(all laugh) famous gym you may know or not given it’s Kalos(all laugh) but that kid Oscar was contacted from there by me and Valen knows each rock gym in the world(all laugh) Oscar heard about her then spoke Tinivillie now says(all laugh)..yeah just extended family like that great person as is her other half Alexander has a daughter Victoria was 7 when I met her first year Kalos now 12 so more cunning(all laugh),Valen just got the nomination at 39,Victrie came at 41 then was 49 me 38 still saw my bunch and all I was so ashamed infact with the brats in the beginning and she is a world famous name said it’s ok bro’s share is mine too(all laugh),hubby is an accountant and extremely naive(all laugh) anyway Valen is actually pretty concerned with Oscar asked him doesn’t he take his wife out sometimes for personal professionalism(all burst into laughter) the answer is um..no we watch documentaries together on the likes of um..Drednaw(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) so says man could’ve been Piplup atleast anyone would’ve except that particular dredge of rivers(all laugh a lot) I said still better than Croconaw though not a legend YET(all laugh) no really I’ll have the time now to introduce you all to my family from Kalos and Unova and Sinnoh too I don’t know how who are mine just keeps on coming I just hope I know all like this(all smile) anyway,then 164 in Sinnoh 100 has fled the scene or very minimal contact once a month weather report(all laugh) but the rest 90 all hall of fame still the same,Hoenn 96 and 65 fled as soon as went to Unova(all laugh) then detectives were after me(all laugh) rest same and this is except Pettelsburg,Unova 230 fled 100 stays(all laugh) but yeah now the situation is totally different there Mrs Olympia I ever contact said Marc is all about showing Percy the low(all laugh) then Kalos 235 fled(all laugh) and 80 remains,Johto 76,48 has fled(all laugh) and rest remained 28 excluding Belly due to the theory(all laugh) Kanto 12 all remains except one(all laugh) cause that one is breaching negetive circles now(all laugh)..,then in Pasio of all places(all laugh) 17,3 fled the scene(all laugh) 14 remains and all the hall of fames there remains I did 12 and sadly includes Danny boy and Rudy lad(all laugh) who are unique samples in this world(all laugh) their alibie to the whole world is that 1.the welcoming rounds first fetches more tourists for the islands(all laugh) 2.Ah man it’s Pasio(all laugh) both of their wives has been fed up saying don’t then whine at home why you don’t get hall of fame(all laugh) no those brats at HQ,we’ll show them how many have won the preliminary rounds(all laugh) still Rudy does only one Danny says 3 rounds win 2 minimum(all laugh) ice skating challenge and so on(all laugh) then there itself tries to give the badge(all laugh) and his gym is normal type(all brust into laughter) and Rudy decides from a boat trip which pokemons are to be used that are ground types(all burst into laughter)..and his battlefield is surrounded by ocean(all burst into laughter)..Trace told us about these two new and upcoming wonders of Pasio and I was like are they like Kommo-O(all laugh)..what a brat those two are Rudy was 23 and Danny 24 when I met them first now 44 and 45 respectively same stuff still(all laugh) actually with age he and Danny both are worsening(all laugh) both has a daughter each they have just about started both say no way we’re going to be gym leaders cause it’s already known as worldwide circus(all laugh)..it’s like Brawn I said so many times why ever 1 on 1 ‘AH! Kid when you grow up you’ll realize the fun in racing a bike on one wheel(all laugh) but I said don’t you want great challengers that you will get if you just allow them to give you the special distinction if not the hall of fame ‘AH!kid not all are hall of fame material you know so why bother life is but a dream enjoy to the most with that joyous scream(all burst into laughter)’ so I realized this old goon doesn’t even want to understand what is hall of fame(all laugh) and now so happy with the things that were given and 9 cities cup and all says 1 on 1 how about a Zekrom for your 1st badge(all laugh) but then his son had to Magnus sweetie(all laugh) man he said the first day I saw the reservation I knew I’m going out of profession(all laugh),then later thought ok atleast be a researcher then(all laugh) then still had to meet Dawnny please SIT STILL(all brust into laughter),man sweet little lady Dawn has no respite still from these tones(all laugh)..and I still remember Danny’s case was that my flower took the initiative of intellectuality cause I might’ve pestered her too much around then(all laugh)..man that age of earliest youth at 18/19 hardly were sane both and then again were together(all laugh) no wonder Trace fled(all laugh) anyway then Mehu was told by Danny boy that you see you must learn to enjoy your time at the gym otherwise it’s useless leading a boring intellectual life(all laugh) so that was just funny cause of Mehu’s antics..and(all laugh),and Rudy lad was just utmost fun all over cause first the brat tries the jealousy trick and I already started preparing Metagross,Snorlax and Pangoro(all laugh) then Mehu takes the bait to fool around with me but her problem is that she knows only one word of appreciation(all laugh)..then Rudy lad tries the flower bouquet trick(all laugh) that too in front me(all laugh) by then I understood it’s of no use cause Mehu was like a staute and in utmost dilema as to what to do next(all laugh) then they have their battle before then the prolonged discussion on intellectuality(all laugh) and I was angry at the end so told Trace just look what happens to the lad when he faces the steeled psychoes(all laugh)..and later Mehu told me in the meeting the lad asked her(laugh),how much he holds your hands how much he smirks at you how much he whispers to you and during all these how far he stays from you(all brust into laughter)..yeah it was something like that(all laugh) then anyway we had our match but my problem was that I was too angry(all laugh) hence it had to be brats that don’t care much about me hence went with Magnezone(all laugh) was against Terrakion(all brust into laughter) again Magnezone beats the brat somehow and Rudy was showboating(all laugh) next in Zygarde(all laugh) still Magnezone somehow gets the brat and it’s a draw(all laugh) then he was shouting(all laugh) and finally Mehu had enough so was screehing swears at him out of deep silence(all laugh) and I was laughing so much in my mind so went with Togdie(all laugh)..now comes Dialga(all laugh)..it’s a draw still but thus I win with only 2 brats(all laugh)..then finally Rudy lad gets grave cause it’s supposed to be humiliating so couldn’t laugh in front of his sis(all laugh) and invites me to discussion privately(all laugh)..there laughed his head off and I had to be cautious else the brat would’ve published our better friendship(all laugh)..so anyway he said I told your best friend who is your wife but at this age thinks being girlfriend is more fashionable(all laugh),anyway(all brust into laughter),I said actually wearing wigs are cause if someone goes on-the-fly it will be the most ENSUING(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs)..thus she is imitating cause already her phone is buzzing that a champ aleardy where’s a flower bequet cause the 10 years a way is with grandpa where I’m being potryed by my beau as a stranger while he secrectly watches my perfromances incognito at Cerulean on Aerodactyl(all laugh)..yeah during his first stay there after Kanto,grandpa I have a few urgencies of that type at Boulder(all laugh)..Boulder knew about it already due to naivety(all laugh) so Mr Oak went to Cerulean faking identities(all laugh)..so I said this is what my sweet Mehu flower is trying that is trying to be Mehadi(all laugh)..,Rudy said I told your flower to stop travelling and get into general training cause she was good enough which was double edged insinuation(all laugh) so your flower politely said no I’m not qualified yet so would rather focus on it and Rudy’s complement of her skill was cause she won against him a ground gym trainer at Pasio(all laugh)..said but I used Diancie(all laugh) against Tapu Fini(all brust into laughter)..so wasn’t of any use as usual like the boat trip(all laugh)..so actually Rudy’s words were used during hellrounds by me to insinuate that it has always been infatuation..but got salt gunned(all laugh)..so,after this my flower during marriage was too dejected and all then a few minutes later again was sleep powdered and I fondled her to death(all laugh) and after match I told her well it seems I have to complement you then all the time else you’re never happy(all laugh),caught cold almost so I held her hands too closely(all laugh)..anyway,actually many who fled are coming back one by one a few contacted and all few places change of guard and all I just hope 1172 gym leaders doesn’t jump me(all laugh) Oscar is ever welcome,Sabrina has to be pestered(all laugh) and Pettlesburg is just my home but(all laugh) well out of 1377 one gym leader is too close to me(all laugh)..infact all asked me at Unova,Sinnoh and Kalos that you either don’t consider a gym leader or too respectful which one worked for her(all laugh) I said just that age(all burst into laughter),then Percy asked me don’t you two fake fight(all laugh) I said um..Percy just the opposition platform if I look at(all laugh) Percy laughed and said tell my beau this(all laugh) any vacation full match must be held(all laugh) prize is if Samantha wins,Percy will do her officibal works for next day(all laugh) and the other way around is(laugh) Samantha agree and PROPERLY prepare to go to a date without Nick their 6 year old son(all burst into laughter) but I will soon spoil both cause they are just so naive(all laugh) that FEELING(all laugh,Brock laughs shaking his head) this is from the crook(all laugh) ever remember 2nd day we were at mount moon the rockets jump us and a researcher was there forgot his name crazy guy(all laugh) then Brock caught a Zoobat I was so upset(all laugh) then whole day all things go on at night moon dance and then Mehu was too close to me(all laugh) and all things go next day or two days later can’t recall I got Bulbasaur and he was extremely hard to get then tame(all laugh) then while taming I ask why some are so hard to tame says,no no apparent reason but one should stick on not give up that sets the men from boys and also some pokemons are like that too you can’t point that thing it’s just can’t be expressed in a word just that FEELING(all laugh)..never can forget that stuff(all laugh) and no not all the gym leaders were in contact I would’ve gone crazy then(all laugh) it was half the numbers approximate but now all 1375 wants me(all laugh) even Blaine,Giovanni and Ackgel(all laugh) Sabrina is normal(all laugh) uncle is there,Mr Daquan’s gym now renovated Harmonica his cousin’s daughter now is there gym leader and she contacts me each week thrice(all laugh) if not talk still has to text of mail(all laugh) and she is a 3 time champ double Unova and Pasio(all laugh) then Oscar the Great Professional is there(all laugh) and the other is Mehu flower..,then uncle of all people whom I contacted sometimes never was bothered about anything going on around my public image but ever cautioned me against the pests but very briefly but firmly which were so helpful cause I was going full Madgaleo at times and had my bunch caught that irritation in my mind could’ve attacked literally anyone,anyway those who hesitated I said,look you all are in positions just search up my professional activities and then if you think I’m all show off,you’re free to cut off,which always worked cause my Chu-bro did that Sinnoh miracle and all knew they’ll only get benefitted so stayed on...anyhow back to this Melodious brat(all laugh)..’Seth,that Mehadi and this Mehadi,can you believe it?’(all burst into laughter)...this is after 50 minutes of professional talk(all laugh)..brat needed a rest(all laugh)..and this is just after my break-up(all laugh)..before the Brock and jackal incident(all laugh)..Brock well no matter what was alright in the sense atleast a damn brat hasn’t left asylum still(all laugh) but the jackal was only cause he’s a jackal(all laugh) jackal I told be professional yeah but Mehadi(all laugh)..’um..Mehadi means..”(all laugh)..’Seth,Mehadi Waterflower or who your travel companion at Johto,then absolutely nothing and now amusing,amusing(all laugh)’...’oh,that Mehadi(all laugh)..well yeah,Mehadi was ever good with water pokemons but yousee I didn’t see her in 8 years(all laugh)..so I don’t know what happened in between,but heard her name so yeah just very happy to know’...now the brat goes into overdrive(all laugh)..’Seth,please I understand break-ups(all burst into laughter),you two were like married couples while dancing(all laughs uncontrollably)..and she saw us dancing once for 10 minutes 9 years back(all laugh)..I still remember it was amusing(all laugh)..nobody can dance so freely with a girl unless she’s your very long time girlfriend or more like wife(all laugh)...yeah,yeah,professional(all laugs uncontrollably)...so must’ve heard about her Gyarados(all laugh uncontrollably)?’,’yeah,right Gyarados well..(all burst into laughter)’...but this brat was cunning(all laughs uncontrollably)...how many hours of study MR. Fox(all laugh)?” Tracey(laugh) : “exactly 18(all burst into laughter).” Mehadi(frown) : “hey,hey you jackal(all laugh)..don’t look at my hubby,don’t call at him(all burst into laughter),don’t make sketches of him with yourself(all laugh)..Brock,why do ripened up namecalled old-men look at Seth?”(all burst into laughter)..” Brock(laugh) : “well,because of his professional contacts in personal spheres only with can catch the meoldies of the heavenly angels(all burst into laughter)..” Gary(laugh) : “YOU(all brust into laughter)..” Mehadi( oy firmly,bit agitated,Seth tenders her laughing) : “SHUT UP YOU NAMECALLS! He’s only Seth..um..(all burst into laughter)..Seth(all laugh) why do they disturb us(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “cause you’re sweet little Mehadi sis(all smile),see no talk till jealousy(all laugh,Mehadi frowns at Seth  im firmly then smiles and rests her head of his shoulder,Seth smiles at her and keeps tendering her)..is frowning at me(all laugh)..too(all laugh) sweet..but(all laugh) Brock,exactly as you said the REASON(all laugh),only a crook can get it instantly(all burst into laughter)..so this cunning Melody(all laugh) almost sobs(all laugh) : “Seth,how to become so professional like you(all uncontrollably laughs)..he..he..that girl..that..(all burst into laughter)..’,’mam(all laugh)..this is shrew the Drew method for pests(all laugh) the tone is also his(all laugh)..shame ’mam(all laugh)..yes we have professional contacts for 9 years,and yes,we understand your concerns(all laugh),but ‘mam please,we were talking about regenerating hypnosis(all laugh)...”,and she actually did break down(all laugh)..so I was just laughing in my mind that such is emotion you know,no matter what I thought I had broken up and Melody is a 3 time champion with elusive name still no matter out of profession and then was so successful and look here all over the place, just one hand on her shoulder,and that’s it(Mehadi smiles at Seth,Seth reciprocates)...to her it’s a beau for life AGAIN but to me despite of my relationship status I only wanted to stop her crying whom I’ve known for ages like my sis and this is what that was for differentiate bro and beau(all laugh) which though wasn’t my idea at all(all laugh)..it was only learnt after the crook left me(all laugh)..no not what you think it was CILI(all laugh)..WHERE’S KOMMO-O,Seth it’s bed time cut this language(all laugh)..no it was him really


and yeah I’ve known her but only professionally and such a great successful person is breaking down to a virtual stranger cause some brat did
something so I just politely said that,’please,this is a public place no matter who comes here,and it was that great club at Marengo private cell, and you’re household name in our profession here they’ll drag you through all dirts possible just calm down it’s alright..’ so the brat calms down and says what her beau did proposed first then went off the grid with someone who was the target all along around our champ for neutrition and our champion too followed suit in grids with another brat soon cause the triangluar great pryed upon her and that 2nd great also followed suit around grids with non-chamipons the first wasn’t physical the 2nd was then the same brat just made a face later found out a different story..a perfect unit of complex combination within 2 and half years too much bonhomie....perfectly learnt from Kalos,which was her 4th region and killed off such a talent completely 2.5 years too much there from 21 to 24 is 3 months older to me though reached round 4 only and the concentration never there and then Unova hardest region again 2 and half years just 1st round 6 best pokemons off in 19 minutes,came back at 26 around settled for a bit obvious talent helps that stuff then gets in a great triangle all because of her talents that never could be hidden no matter what and that too with an Alakazam and a Uxie but the other two side arms had other intensions and they infact were instantly happy just threw her in the tomb and that’s it..never go to Kalos if you’re from Johto-Kanto circle till your 5th region atleast and never before you complete battle-frontier where you see many villege competitions as well and face challengers there and hence know your own regional grassroot professions more to strenghten your values and if you’re not mentally very strong then make that very last region by then you’llbe 31 atleast,and may be even married and all much better...cause people will come up to husband and wife,’calls by name lets have a bang hey,leave him ever old,change it a bit old will then reinvigorate else ever divorce’..yeah,exactly this language and also the physical behaviour polite to them may be but not so to me atleast and happily agreed cause they’re good friends and no not mutual cause the husband was formally talked with and he happily lets his wife go nothing matters unless physicality..and the husband is told..’hey,come on sunshine lets have a night,let her go she’s alright,going with her everyday get separated’..this too I heard again not mutual I guess..and actually that brat VIA her parents insinuated here ‘a just a moment just a mistake very bad yes but doesn’t make anyone unfaitfull’...to them if you do all around without vulgarity,which you understand what they are saying and THAT,hardly a trouble..and vulgarity applies for married couples only not the other way around hence it got too medious here,both brats were avid followers here..exactly why never send people there unless they’re matured or strong enough and I guess Cerulean was trying their hands at it too but it’s Knato so a bit hard,takes caution..and thus my endeavours to that brat and here too,takes caution..(laugh)...had lady Dawn been there after Sinnoh Brock(Brock laughs and shakes his head)..only the pokemons are absolutely the best and the outside our profession is top in the world ONLY academically and other sections too I guess,but people mostly are like that in general unless they are above 35 or something...very carefully mingle with people there cause even true good people their values are totally different,you have to force your dignity only then they’ll realize you which takes ages in this matter like it did with Clemont and then they themselves will protect you from pests,I had to go for a date there cause it was first and that brat was all over to get it so her friend was chosen,got the treatment,Clemont later asks,I chide him to maximum for a full hour saying why I feel what I feel,realizes always handled that brat and other pests but never himself realized that stunt thought just a brat and never realized me fully too,later understands what’s gonna happen just calls me and all I tell him not to mingle personally but you’re way younger to me by 7 long years so you’re of the age of many gym leaders who were little kids when I met them in first two regions or 3 and they are now recent leaders and to them I’m like a big bro and in that way you the same always will be ever in this life and will have all helps that’s plausible and possible from me to my best capasity but these don’t include my personal life at all thus you need not to know one thing about it and you realize all the rest cause I know you extremely well and how truly good you’re at heart but I’ll be professional to you utmost till I want that veil to be lifted you’re free to choose your side and/or keeping this contact at all but I’ve the very best fervant wishes,said he’ll keep contacts for sure and will be personal from his side as well so I said fine later thus has been fed to Mr Oak(laugh),he was 27 when I met him now 33,a year younger to Senor and then he has had a strange kind of career cause he went to engineering signal processing and all and finished by 22 a stupendus academic career at the best University in his engineering strem at whole Kalos and then a great professional always interested about pokemons so got a job related to that in signals but then at 24 decided to try training so from 24 to 25 formal studies and then from did travell Kalos,starter was Treecko then got a Tangela then got a Leafeon but was undecided on what is to be done so aborted his journey after 2 months just and wasn’t really confident then went back to work released Tangela and Leafeon were never tamed nor wanted to stay but Treecko was of course kept then infact he was excellent in work and his first company gave him a salary that would’ve been like quadruplued and that itself was stupendus level yet gave that up just for his love for pokemons and so on a true honest and good guy to his very core so could do these and did get the second job after he finished his 2 months got into Christopher-Gower lab yet somehow the travelling around lured him and was as soon as saw me almost,that lab I first went consulting my contacts there and spoke with so many all knew my name and the whole world broke in,the lab themselves told many of our workers want to go out with you for sometimes atleast I said only full timers ready to actively participate with Heatrans and Lumineons(laugh)..then some said yeah we I said out of profession(laugh)..then he jumped up higher(laugh) and I saw tremendus academic career and hence just came along you know out of so many all said yeah too desperate already has sufferer some serious injuries(laugh) and his skills helped me there to the extent that I would’ve had to abort my journey had he not been there cause too many people pestered my bunch and I in that condition would’ve lost my head and turned on everyone but he was very calm ever was beside me in these matters and was like Cili at Unova and then we were travelling and and had a very detailed talk with me after the first month itself when he was still thinking to be a trainer and got a Seedot but was unsure again and all that then had a talk and understood that training isn’t for him so Seedot was released cause never wanted to be with him but Treecko was very well tamed but he didn’t fondle his starter like Trace has(laugh) so Treeckocan battle atleast but rather like a Pidgey as well though the potential is there of a Sceptile and then he was after one month totally focused on observations and studies and all and in 3/5 years has really escalated in his career I’m so happy for that and his girlfriend Megan now as well same profession and lab and same age as well,she is the physical suppliment specialist from Kalos as well and she is in same field as Vidonia is and she went to breeding and suppliment studies that gruelling 8 year course more so cause she did all at a time and with one more upto 24 and then travelled Kalos for 2 and Unova of all places for another 2 in between completed another 1 to get all degrees and else and all in 29 just like Vidonia has done and then joined the same lab and Clemont did the same already working there for 3 years Gary knows Ms Megan Bromstrong pretty known figure in certain circles in breeding area really and Clemont the same in instruments section I actually told him after he decided to focus on this that why still travel with us go to some labs said no your bunch intrigues me with the intelligence and then with the power and all here itself I’ll learn a lot and
this bug of travelling around Kalos isn’t leaving me so that as well so sticked around then went and in 3 years really has been superb and he was right abolutely certainly my bunch and discussions did help him in his way and he helped a lot with those pests that were trying to test me every moment cause he knew what they were upto in a way though he only worked for 2.5 years total and knew very little but great intuition and enthusiasm so was great and travelling like that to 187 and 72 top notch places getting a Heatran,Darkrai,Zeraora,Zygarde and Deoxys five pseudo-legends and then the way I got them and who they have become as the real self that they are and still the same phenomena with Lycanroc,Malamar,Dusknoir and Incineroar especially how she just came all by herself without absolutely anything from me and then of course Greninja that phenomena that a pokemon came then stayed then released then again came back then again released then again finally decided to stay with us and heightened her powers like that that really made him decide that he will take up the job at a starter lab but only after my travel finished and all these buddies of mine helped him to that unique position as to others were rather from general universities and all he is though knows pokemons first hand and saw a bunch that’s not going to be seen again in his lifetime atleast and so has been served very well and that was some experience for me as well and he is 33 now pretty well established and Megan too at 34 now fully professional in her area and are happy with everything about themselves and each other personal and professional and Bonnie is ofcourse will be here soon is a researcher as good as Trace is by all means has a Komala like Mrs HALMSLEY(all laugh)..thankfully she is far more cunning than poor Mrs Halmsly(all laugh)..sweet sweet Kane darling(all laugh)..man that brat has never found peace in his life(all laugh) Senor and Senor was just that the childhood nonsense suddenly gripped her at old age and escalated but still except that very very nice person no doubt and steady as well never trekked like that and then that travel never complained and I just wished had the brains to have a discussion and not jump like that and no my mental states didn’t help her or family either anyway,doesn’t matter just best wishes and Celmont was professional but in a different way only he had some trekking experience but just 2 months or 3 so I told him everything what to do when I trekked and I went to volcanos with 2 day old Heatran(laugh) Kalos was a totally different experience to me and Clemont perfectly understood my bunch’s position out of rest two one just the glory and nothing else and Bonnie was ofcourse all known(all laugh) then Clemont’s skills were very very important to me then actually most essential without him would’ve had to hire someone infact thus the journey would’ve never been possible and I was who I was cause of my bunch it was a matter of myself I’ve known my bunch’s position since Unova completed it’s first anniversay during the journey in the second year and the implications so it was just about me so that was exactly what I needed in Kalos and that is why I was so lucky there as well,anyway to return to the bratting,Sinnoh and Pasio will pull that stunt but will have the decency to do it in absolute privacy or among very close ¾ friends max,Hoenn only in full privacy but it will be a stunt still,Unova varies from place to place somewhere like Johto,somewhere like worst Kalos though those places are least in comparison and yeah that incident with me was in such a place but generally not in public but in close friends party may be during parting ¾ will get tripled,still much better,Cili is an exception really cause his place is worst Kalos,now shifted of course can’t stay there such a man in a profession like breeding so many people will come up...Kanto the best only in full privacy and never a stunt has to be mutualwith distinct signs shared for a span otherwise just a long hug no vulgarity,Johto in full privacy but a mere infatuation will do it may be not always mutual but very rare with not so much distinct signs and span and all and will be tolerated still cause among best friends can happen only still no vulgarity,which only can happen in Unova and Kalos and places in Sinnoh...I say this cause you all know about me and Mehu and no doesn’t matter what we are,but first wasn’t done,second only one person was there who by then was mutual big-bro very own and 5 years older no way a friend or even a coach or mentor,third all privacy was tried first and fourth and most important we both were together for 5 long years 24/7 and showed distinct signs for atleast 4 and half and most importantly both our families knew everything in full details that too can only happen in Kanto in such cases and only then did that moment appear and never before...this all cause you know(laugh) legends are anywhere now-a-days may be next week Bernetur 1000 will be at Cerulean(laugh)..anyway,the north region in Kalos is much much better though more like Hoenn and not even Sinnoh in general cause they are detached mostly so homely so the values are stronger,and that’s why Jim that kid was allowed in the gym being his first region also was my fan and all and yeah was excellent for first region a long way to go really has that thing to go beyond 5 absolutely if keeps right and was way more polite compared to the brats from other parts of the region I saw there,other bunch I’ll personally counsel the brat then only let him or her in especially if first 3 regions otherwise for female brats Marengo also gives them the hall of fame and male versions straight to the hall of fires at Cinnaber and thus both versions won’t be seen again in Kanto,Percy and his beau were approached with this issue during Elite4,says its public culture they can’t do much except restrictions..all good hall of fame people atleast like that Jim kid..much polite in 1st and 2 nd then 3rd understands themselves and eventually perfect persons....Percy started with Kalos,Kalos-Frontier,Sinnoh,Hoenn,Johto,Unova,Kanto,Pasio then 7-0...all wins and ever so down to earth person, Samantha his wife as well from Hoenn actually, Hoenn,Sinnoh,Pasio-couldn’t win,Hoenn-Frontier,Johto,Unova,Kanto-couldn’t win,Percy did(laugh),lost to him in semis(laugh,all smile) then Kalos...met in Kanto and then Percy had to wifesist her in Kalos for reimburshment of the loss for a full year then only was allowed to lesserly go to Pasio while his new wed-wife completed the hall of fame(laugh,all smile)...so they realize the concern and well as Nigel but yeah they can’t do much really...really within 35 and half complete all these..very difficult for sure but no excuses if one can’t learn form own bunch’s behavious to you and others at all(all smile)...anyway,(laugh) all these again as I say the more the better because of course tomorrow 100 suffix Cycloturnotics’ are coming to Cerulean with 230 suffixes in a brigade of 1000(laugh)...never know,anyway,so I realized her melodious concerns and then said please I’m a stranger to you why so emotional get a hold just makes a face says ‘if that’s professional what is friendship I’ve known you for so many years barely saw you twice or thrice,hardly spoke more and once a week almost all on pokemons never bothered to tell your life I rather told you a bit and you never asked yet never stopped talking no matter what I didn’t want to talk with you but you compelled me to keep that may be 6 times a month contact for 5 minutes each for 9 long years all because you remembered that moment I beat you and now you’re so much above everyone still doesn’t matter and your discussions helpes me everyday for the last 9 years,my personal friends so many left me but you just don’t bother at all to you I’m still the one who beat you all the 9 years back and you’ve won everything in between and has a bad public image yet you don’t bother about anything at all,even today you’re not at all bothered about personal lives and no to me you’re not a stranger but the best teammate I’ll ever have because you’ll remind me before I die that whatever lets talk about pokemons,so that is special and I can just about say anything but that will corrupt our relation then cause you’re not going to budge by any means to talk about anything except the profession and in the last 9 years you never bothered about anything we’ve stayed exactly there’ and so on and this exact nature had got me into many troubles cause all weren’t like her and so on(all smile)..certainly none in my profession in Kalos(laugh)..but anyway,(laugh)..that’s Melody for you Brock,professional- phone-8-minute-6/month-contact-friend,but look at the turn of future(laugh)...I go undercover without anyone in the world knowing except Lubos and Thor and thus none knows me except Sabrina of course whom I didn’t tell this cause it would’ve dissapointed her too much only but she is she so realized that not for nothing I spent 3 nights at Marengo forest with 8 ghost types including Gengar and so on,so she thought I might be doing something legal or illegal but Sabrina just doesn’t bother at all and goes on in the meantime our sweet Melody contacts hersaying what happened to Ketchum,to which she said none knows may be something illegal,that’s the right thing to say cause if I’m legal and alive I’ll come out but if it’s mentioned that I’m legal,I’m done... so does that Melody picks up the clue and just tells Sabrina that if she ever meets me again just to tell that Melody was truly happy to see a so and so man and that’s it...so anyway,then finally greatest wisdom dawns upon the greatest boss that he has a bit more fun left to enjoy here so I come out alive and all my contacts return though they were strictly told not to discuss about undercover or else they’ll be reported if I wanted to so then I did get the brat back but she was extremely professional to me for next two years then the next few months said going out of profession will get married and so on and then that really was that wished her best but again 4 lunatics sabotaged 230 battelions to send all contacts underground but I hear about those contacts show me Trace I do know very well that you surely do know me?” Tracey(solemn) : “pretty much,just doesn’t want to contact you and no never contacted Mehadi either,stay professional for next 6 years happily married with her husband for 3 years John Harrison,double Kanto now psychic specialist also from Marengo,who is in profession same thing he did in Marengo but way more in demand like how Melody was at Marengo he is similar now at Shamrockmoss psychic type specialist as well mostly the dark ones as you know and has a son of 2 and another born 3 months back also a son,Shamrockmoss,herself not involved professionally anymore for 3 years now thus also doesn’t have any reasons to contact but still no grudge on only teammate when it’s about profession which can change cause 1.you had crossed the barrier through profession itself thus it overflows and overfloods everything and 2.about a few others as usual they eavesdropped and your state is universally known as well atleast to Gym leader hall of fame and thus the rest is understandable as Telplocus too is universally known thus they don’t bother cause they have much respect that you’re no more a professional outside temporarily which we all want to become permanent outside the 11 city circle or Pettlesberg but I’m afraid that’s not why we started today,so Seth,we’d wish to restart the gym battling…
Seth(laugh) : “right Trace but the brat that leaked both the newses VIA Lubos of all people(burst into laughter)...true brat..anyway,I’m ever in profession Trace you all know ever will be it’s just that the right preparations must be given to me and protection that my wife will be able to talk to me each day not incognito and will see me again guranteed that is get the govt involved and that’s it as you all know Kanto govt has my back and thus atleast here I’m fine though Kanto govt is the bigger version of Indigo Platue anyway,Trace fine,I’ll get into the mood but please if you can spare the time and the patience don’t..” Gary(laugh) : “hm...Seth-Boy..hm...,Seth,we don’t bother and I surely don’t just get us back to the mood to show that that was fake show.” Seth(laugh) : “perfect Gary,so let me remember...Brock,I’m sorry for the wrong turn but..” Brock(smile) : “you’ve always turned the upside down man,this one’s the same Mehadi,just continue...” Seth(laugh) : “right,the first thing I’ll do is to swear everything off cause these emotions were obviously not melodious at all..thus, a great date,my only with someone other than my sweetie in Kalos as I said what goes on there..so the brat goes in, “Seth..I’m..”,”Mr Ketchum,’mam”,’um..Seth..”,” ‘Mam,I’m a 5 league champion and you surely know the rest/i’m 4 years older to you,surely I know the best/you think that you’re friend knows me well,and I’m ever friendly/but mam please relaize that personally I’m pretty deadly’..(laugh)..this word gets the brat totally confused cause she doesn’t understand which side to sail to cause it’s totally contradictory cause my disposition and word and behaviour doesn’t match at all(laugh)...right that’s the sweet music..still continuing though...the brat gets overjoyed and tries to sit beside me(all laugh)...’,’SHAME ‘mam(all laugh),right you heard,sit where you did/’mam please let me finish,cause that’s exactly thy need(all burst into laughter)/so see ‘mam all this glory,this power,this much fame/never nothing is ever there without me where’s my name?’(all burst into laughter)...now the brat gets the Greninja’s Kalos Wisdom from a friendly-looking-venerable- deadly(all burst into laughter) who has won 55 hall of fame gym badges among required 88(all laugh) in 6 months(all laugh) and all best hall of fames in 6 months(all laugh) on the way to his 6th league and got the rocket defused to friendship(all laugh)..so she finally sits down politely(all laugh)..and says “um..sorry but..”,’halt there ‘mam,right there,it’s an honour to talk to you(all burstinto laughter)/sand is ever as you madam,but the word is same that’s shrew(all uncontrollably laughs)/’mam I know you know a lot the whole world is only a pot/but the trouble as I see ‘mam it breaks just takes that one shot(all bursts into laughter)’...the brat is totally dead now(all laugh)..says,’um..Seth can we talk Pokemons’(all burst into laughter),’yeah surely Miette..that was the name still recall cause since next day in regular contact why are you not me(laughs,rest smile)..same stuff like BellyGelly(all laugh)..chemical engineering management degree,too good academic record then worked at 3 major companies before falling into the dark stream of 11 city Smogon abruptly yeah new import coming in a couple of years as soon as that that little brat does their chief head of Kalos Wisdom(laughs,rest smile) since that day itself has ever been in contact for some reason(all laugh) which Brock can only be discovered if you agree to play a LOGICAL GAME(all laugh),knows Zed too well too(all laugh),Freeze,Yedi,Kunzi and Ochichi(all laugh) all said well you surely want to have the full medicine production house here(all laugh),I said well we’ll require women then compeers,honoured,honoured women(all brust into laughter,Seth laughs a lot,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing in silence  oy),so.)..no this was one of my big problems you know if I say beautiful women being a man then..(laughs,all laugh,Mehadi laughs a lot  oy in silence),so I was thinking what could be the right way I was 12(all laugh),so(laugh) asked Cello at 4.75(uncontrollbaly laughs,all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in silence),Cello was supposed to be going somewhere with Rachel aunty who had a hard time trying to put the little brat off after a field day(all laugh),so I was returning after my walk around(all laugh) so anyway,she was trying to get Cello ready I just forgot to ask some rhymes to aunty so went in(all laugh),aunty says see how you’re influencing this little pest(all laugh),Cello jumps up seeing me wriggling away from aunty,bro bro mom is trying to make me a beautiful man despite telling me I’m not so(uncontrollbaly laughs,Mehadi too uncontrollbaly laughs,all burst into laughter),now aunty is extremely angry upon me(all laugh),Seth what are you teaching them(all laugh),I said look all these little brats are whole day on my head so what can I do must be either of Aurie,Jitters,Sintu and Ellie has to sit around me all time at school(all laugh),who sits beside you apart from Aurie(all brust into laughter),Yumn sis Yumn sis(bursts into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs,all brust into laughter),man when Cello was saying on the marrige day do you want me to call you bro I was mentally squeezing her cheeks saying yeah Cello sis(all laugh)..later met me at the farm and literally tried to ride upon my shoulders too much bonhomie(all laugh)..and her hubby brat is best left unspoken(all laugh)..sees me at the farm hum..too sweetie..isn’t it too sweetie(all laugh)..WHEN THAT BRAT WAS SULKING AT THE GYM HER BRATS WERE ASKING ME IF I COULD ANSWER THEM IF THERE’S CLOUD YET RAIN BUT CLOUD DOESN’T ASSURE RAIN THEN HOW COULD I TELL WHEN THE RAIN WILL STOP AT ALL(all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in silence)..I said I guess it was Goldy(all laugh),YEAH AND Swampie WAS PATRONIZING WITH ME SAYING CAN’T EVEN DISTINGUISH GLAZE FROM CRAZE GOLDY WHAT WILL TYRIE SAY IF YOU RECRUIT HIM ANYWAY OUR MASTER HAS GONE TO THE RIVERSIDE BUSHES(all burst into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in fits of laughter in silence,Seth laughs a lot  er) his problem was I never fed him by my own hands unlike Cello hence(all laugh)..I told Dave that see why I left home(all laugh)..,he told them well you know bro might’ve done this and that with you but he many days sang both me and my wife to sleep(all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs  oy in silence)..I said yeah my lucky days(all laugh) then all rode upon me even that little brat Zara too jumped in I said mate you have the whole world against you(all laugh) said thus I can see them countering(all laugh),so I said fine and I don’t remember which song I sang undercover but what I sang to them was massive cause the other people there who were just officials now too much bonhomie(all laugh) they were surprized at this cause all heard but didn’t see how distinguished people become little kids(all laugh) and you know Cello,Fel,Tunkie and Quittie and who they are in our world(all laugh) they literally became 5 year olds and their soulmates 4(all laugh) Mundie,Timtu,Tintini and Kittie were worse infact(all laugh),Kittie gravely asked me when saw me there at firm,yeah Mr Seth Ketchum,pokemon master hall of fame,yet to accept(all laugh) I want to register a complaint against you to my wife who was on my shoulders then(all laugh),said you see ..**teddy bear’s picnic..**


..anyway then aunty gets it all wrong(all laugh) so chides me hum Seth already started the journey haven’t you(all burst into laughter),anyway(all laugh,Seth laughs a lot,Mehadi too laughs a lot  oy in silence),and it’s cause Yumi spent her whole day at the lab or at my home Harris’ big sis that is sweet sweet Hunnie(all laugh) with the help of Zed when he was here dragged her home with Kane and Harris himself home at 9 in the night  next day 8:00 again at school till 15:30(all laugh)..some fun we’ve had really but now it’s a different dimension you know(all laugh) cause first Pallet High is of Interregional fame now(all laugh) and second is that the lab has grown to be truly sensational too(all laugh)..by the way I still can’t desist this one Violet how’s your hubby’s interpretation of your as a high school teacher(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “well first day Mr Garner invited me I told the crook says,school in woods


"



,anyway so at this I was ever angry so even to her I said atleast I don’t try to become beautiful(all burst into laughter),yeah mom it’s true bro says beautiful men are very cunning but doesn’t tell me what means cunning(all uncontrollably laugh,Tracey and Daisy uncontrollably laugh in tears laughing)..man we missed you Trace in those days you know the preparatory indeed(all laugh,Tracey says yeah thankfully was exposed to Pallet Wisdom at the 11th hour of 29,all laugh even more)..no it’s another saga how Professor Dr Tracey Skechit was appointed for those utter brats in the last 6 months(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..Gary please a bit cause my knowledge can’t penetrate the wicked including those who feel and were here since the very start of their college days here(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “man it’s a different stuff you know as I said grandpa said that Dr jackal is already at my level just less experienced but looking at how happy he has become having stepped onto the right den first being able to sketch it through the days second and most importantly now being able to pester so many with wickedness grandpa said will push him out of a couple millenia in a couple of days just allow him to interact with his days in other cases it will have some psychological effects but this one will be helped cause this sample will Skechit down(all laugh)..but the crook even scared grandpa said extremely wicked of Flint to never allow him here would’ve lodged a complaint otherwise(all laugh)..I still recall I returned from Pasio and Allie says bro saw your match you know your strategies were supreme as were you but your being lacked THAT FEELING(all laugh),I said yeah now one and half year has equipped him to even discern from TV(all laugh)..um,no he didn’t see any matches when Golem returned asked him do you feel son that the rising moon


now Rachel aunty is genuinely miffed so says Seth just get out you have made our life impossible to live here hounourably(all laugh),now instantly this word strikes me so I next day told Cello and remember she was 5,don’t ever be a woman Cello honoured honoured woman(uncontrollbaly laughs,all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing),bro mom wants to me to look like a woman(all brust into laughter),yeah age related(all brust into laughter)..now this goes on and a few days later I was summoned by Warden ofcourse(all laugh),Seth I warn you you’ll be barred from entering(all laugh),rhyming with Ursaring whose that pokemon Gary(all brust into laughter) and it was so cause whenever I or Gary was chided we eavesdropped the other to use it on each other later(all laugh,Gary laughs a lot),anyway to this before Warden could do anything Gary says(laugh),professionally she means you’re mixing with kids who are personally in search of professional priority regading their personality thanks(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) now to this also before warden I said yeah COUNTERING(all brust into laughter) and for God’s sake Myla aunty is 30 years older to us(bursts into laughter,all laugh a lot) was 42 we 12(all laugh),so anyway then Warden chided me and Gary more ofcourse(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) next day Zed is told your little bro is honouring women too much(uncontrollbaly laughs,Mehadi too uncontrollbaly laughs  oy in silence,all brust into laughter),who was at his first year at technical school so this was video(all laugh),said um..yeah I understand civility is ever unfulfilled unless supported by the love that ceases the duality of honour and honoured(all brust into laughter),so he wasn’t mingled with again(all laugh a lot) anyway so that was the story(all laugh)..**


..but as usual our first 14 years are so hard to end isn’t it Gary(all laugh)..” Gary(laugh) : “well I can only sympathize with Mehadi infact that she was spared for this part(all laugh)..cause man one pair of married couple made our life untenable(all laugh)..and it was crazy for us cause all were like exactly that speechless(all laugh a lot)..and I still recall it was so serious then we did what we did(all laugh)..


and I recall Zed’s reply later to us Rachel aunty was seriouslly miffed(all laugh)..now Zed takes Seth there and tells me to hide at the right place(all laugh),Seth apologize to her,sorry aunty it’s just that,I’m having some age related ticking inside me MENTALLY(all brust into laughter),no it’s ok Seth I’m saying aunty he can’t word his thoughts properly so please allow my audacity(all laugh),yeah you’re indeed the source that I know for sure(all laugh),um..well may be but that too will become clear as I say(all laugh) so what he means is that when one sees a duality in gender the question is that what is to be done with it and it starts from the very thrist to be born thus one tries to go back by means of formulations which dictates that either generalie the duality or realize the falsity(all laugh) now we all know everyone won’t be able to do it in maxima due to only us ourselves(all laugh),Zed I’ve heard enough of your theories GET OUT(all laugh),alright Seth take over don’t talk about how to cease the difference between pollution,pollutant and who pllutes bye(all brust into laughter)..man aunty was extremely irritated(all laugh),so screams at Seth,who says,when one screams the vocal cords are agitated thus one has to gargle then later the throat may still give troubles then one has to drink water which I was doing one day then eventually when I went to washroom I was wondering how this whole process could be beautiful beautiful(all uncontrollaly laugh,Seth and Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter),now aunty sighs and says Seth listen we understand what you’re but don’t become so extremist(all laugh),no I don’t try to do it intentionally aunty never but when I enter the field like yesterday itself I saw a few Accelgors(all laugh),so went to them asked them how they were they said you see lad this idea to know about the states of the others is indeed the reason why you can’t stop but to bother that there’s something that you can do in your case or the other exactly if you never tried why would you be to yourself just ever another(all laugh)?


,so then as you know this was foisted upon me in nerveous channels not at all in this language(all laugh) I had to counter it(all laugh) so I today I went to school and our sitting order is in a row of 12 columns starting from one side it’s Susan,Sintu,Esmie,Ellie,Jitters,Yumi,Aurie,Scarlie,Cladlie and my disciple-in-chief(all laugh),then next row to us the rest of the infatuated brats sit(all laugh)?
and yeah as Cello said beside me is Yumi and Aurie and then behind us is Allie,Giddy,Benji,Tempie,Igo,Glennie,Zennie,Aju,Arrie,Lui,Ghusie,Timu,Nilu(all laugh..lot),TRICKY(all burst into laughter)..THIS EXACTLY THIS IS WHY YOU’RE ALWAYS CALLED UNDER THE COVER(all laugh),Mou and RENU(all burst..),and you were supposed to inspect the intentional lapses of situational congruence(all un..)..man Lui,Penny and Cladlie are as much brats as these last 4 are SO NAIVE(all laugh..lot),Harris and Kane out of whom Lui,Benji,Igo and Tempie are my supporters and Ghusie,Zennie,Glennie and Timu their sympathizer(all laugh) who work as moles among not not males..umm(all burst into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs  oy),I see TOO MUCH BONHOMIE(all laugh),..um..sorry aunty but this language is what(all laugh a lot),yeah indeed I understand Seth indeed(all laugh),um..sorry anyway(all laugh),then to speak more about my two utmost irritating sides in more details is that one is Yumi who is hellbent to make me presentable as her twin(all laugh) and the other is Aurie whom you know very well(all laugh),yeah rhyming with Barbaracle right(all laugh),um..yeah(all laugh)but then they still are like my little sis so it’s just fooling around together and same for Cladie and Scarlie no matter(all laugh) but the one that really makes me concerned is the other one especially mentioned cause that is my disciple(all laugh),yeah we have seen enough of that brat Penny(all laugh)..whose the student’s representative Seth(all laugh),Susan(all laugh),yeah hence the bonhomie(all laugh)..AND EXACTLY WHY SHE,MOJO,AIM,MURGI,Allegra THE RIGHT WAY(all burst..) AND ESMIE ARE WITH YOU ELSE THEY WOULD’VE BEEN FORCED TO ASK AROUND whose whose BEAU(all laugh a lot),um..sorry..(all laugh),no no DON’T WORRY(all laugh) my 3 year old daughter already knows your antics only too well(all laugh) whose side does Susan take across the ILLUSIVE neutrality(all laugh),’um..(all laugh)’,I see too much bonhomie(all laugh) tell me about Susan’s colleague ACROSS PHYSICAL FORMS(all laugh a lot),’yeah Reverend Langdon(all laugh)’,’forget it the division(all laugh)’,’38 under Reverend Nelson Nellie Nilu Langdon,39 under Susan(all laugh)’,’who does the one has most as a following who looks of a certain PHYSICAL form(all laugh a lot)’,’look aunty they..(all laugh)’,’and thus their too(all laugh),how many in numbers except Susan(all laugh)’,’um..no not her entirely it’s just a layer of civility(all laugh a lot) but yeah well except Scarlie ofcourse as you know..(all laugh)..’,’why are all the girls blindly on your side Seth(all laugh a lot,Mehadi laughs a lot  oy),mom mom bro says it’s cause they’re told constantly that they’re girls but not woman(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears laughing  oy),Seth what is going on behind our backs and Gary no need to eavesdrop having taken this little brat along with you come out(all laugh,Gary laughs a lot),Gary comes first words I believe aunty your concerns will see more light as Seth personally describe your counting of girls professionally showing the generalizability in midst of specificity so that those who aren’t personally girls but professionally so doesn’t get wrongly attirbuted with the gender that professionally symbolizes a girl penetrating unfairly into HIS personal spheres,thanks(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Mehadi,Lillie and Gary uncontrollably laugh in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter),so before aunty could say anything I said look Scarlie is..(all laugh),yeah WHOLE WORLD KNOWS whose WIFE SHE IS SINCE 11.5 HENCE FOR .75 LONG LONG YEARS(all laugh)..AND WHO WERE THE BEST NOT NOT MEN(all laugh) hence have personally hired you to professionally advocate her marriage to the general mass specified by her parents(all brust into laughter) you brat SPIT OUT WHY YOUR RESULTS ARE EVER POOR NOW(all laugh)’,’she means personally Seth not generalized in profession(all burst into laughter,Gary laughs a lot)’,’YOU BRAT GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE(all laugh)’,’mom mom when Gary is told this he comes out then says forgot to personally add don’t also be mentally what’s to me now there to which bro adds rhyming with Simisear whose that pokemon mom(all uncontrollably laugh)’..then ofcourse both of us fled in the meantime(all laugh) so poor Cello was scolded left and right and was debarred from meeting us(all laugh),Warden heard it and sighed saying Rachie to them it only rhymes with a Nosepass(all laugh),next day Dulu uncle is hostaged at my home(all laugh) we made his life impossible to live for the night with rhymes(all laugh) so next day Cello is off then Rachel aunty asked me seriously I said you know Aurie,Jitters,Sintu and Ellie since they were 0(all laugh) and Yumi since 3.5 and Susan,Mini(all laugh..lot),Idu,Esmie,Murgi,Allergy(all laugh..lot),Mojo and Aim(all laugh a lot) for finally Lemur(all burst..)..man it couldn't have been for anyone sweeter and simpler than poor Lamia(all laugh..lot)..so i said you know them since 4.5(all laugh) and been seeing them for all these years now and you know why they behave as they do it’s just their more than very own flesh and blood infact the lack of it helps them rather than hindering(all laugh),and no I’ve not been kind on any and Timu,Sluis,Renu,Mou,Ghusie,TRICKY(all laugh a lot)..and you were the one to categorize unanimity us only reflectivity(all un..,..),NILU(all burst into laughter)..and you extol covariation of terminology in intellect(all un..,..),Harris and Kane are sticking with me cause what I was telling the not not males are best left in darkness(all laugh) and then you know about Cladlie and Scarlie(all laugh) and me and Gary did what we did cause only we knew the torture they have had to endure 24/7 from us all cause they really were true to themselves and just that(all laugh) and we infact asked Zed who was 16 final year high school so most wise(all laugh),he said anything is possible in illusion cause in the end it becomes illusive thus fails but the thing is that it doesn’t happen by itself cause that’s illusive(all laugh) so they


you know Cladlie and Scarlie how they behave with the whole world and themselves it’s just what they are and man it’s been 31 damn years now(all laugh)..no you know I told both May and Drew about them a bit rest they did themselves(all laugh) and it’s just the same thing between them all infact never understood why would the main centre be observing from away(all laugh)?


and no it was worse in case of Scarlie and Cladlie you know cause Centy was 4 then(all laugh a lot)..man it’ll be a complete novel if I start that(all laugh)..but for this one Penny is a must isn’t it Gary(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “it’s impossible to break the cover without his surveillance(all laugh) but Seth what would your McShin say on this one(all laugh)”
Seth(laugh) : “well he and Jasu both are absolutely miffed with the fact that how could they be beaten by the two who weren’t concentrated enough(all laugh)..man Jasu and McShin are by all means in all time hall of fame you the current top 110 is once in 2 millenias by every means(all laugh) what characters we have including Gabriel and Mateo of all people(all laugh) then still the likes of Blink and Abriana and Artemus and Mallow and Kawai and Frenzy and so on Lusiminie,Ebicidie(all laugh..),Sippie(all laugh..,..),Klick and Kufki(all laugh,..),Homu and Pumu yeah(all laugh a lot)..”


no I only tell Jitters,Aurie,Sintu and Ellie all time but not Yumi,Susan and Esmie cause they doesn’t stay here all time still(all laugh) that they can be termed girls by themselves only if I myself think of me as a boy(all brust into laughter),cause even if they do then you’ll be ever elusive for them isn’t it Seth,anyway(all brust into laughter,Mehadi laughs whispering to Seth,’attitude’,Seth laughs a lot  er whispering privately,both laugh a lot)’,’thus they will be the same to me rhyming with any Victini hence their difference will fall apart exactly as told me a Magikarp aunty whose that pokemon(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah when the evoluted version comes after you..,never patient my bug(all laugh)..,man I did all that then enter here 2 trophies in first two with absurd brats and mostly to top it off was my toffee-flower(all laugh)..Jitters told me day one asked her you know it’s a great virtue to be courageous thus explore things regardless of different opinions exactly why you yourself too are such a good trainer(all laugh) almost sobs(all laugh),how could you say that Seth doesn’t discuss my methods with me(all laugh)..so Jitters said I knew from day one that man if this Gyarados was in school with us would’ve been a mayhem(all laugh),anyway then as aunty says you’ll see,mom bro told me when you think you’re a woman you create a duality more visible than when you call yourself a girl what does duality and visible mean(all brust into laughter),’yeah I’m showing you little brat what they mean(all laugh),Seth unless you erase these off IN 3 DAYS,I’m going to call Zed(all laugh)’,’sorry aunty(all laugh)’,’yeah your tone itself says you’re only saying rhyming with Phampy(all laugh)’,’yeah yeah sorry I’ll rinse my sins off now as would’ve never any Croconaw whose that pokemon(all brust into laughter)’..and man it turned out to be so so true(all laugh),I first time told Toto to behave(all laugh),you see compeer when you start to behave you entangle yourself more and more into the depths of rules that only tries to free you up from the definition of yourself doesn’t it from where you started(all brust into laughter) just like you’re called Mr Ketchum by Mr Mehadi’s brats(all laugh) but we call her brats so as well yet we call you look-only-at cause to us you’re most special exactly why both your and our plight to be general thus only our bond is so special that it encompasses the general thus becomes a specialty in the especiality of generalized absolute specialty that generalizes doesn’t it(all burst into laughter),so I knew this brat is once ever by every means(all laugh),Snorlie was same but he would just sleep(all laugh),Snovie,Shuppie etc were similar to Toto though(all laugh) but Toto’s method were directly foisted upon you those brats were polished atleast(all laugh)..later Copy came(all laugh) and by then I knew it’s just another side of Toto and the viseversa(all laugh) but this pest as you know was more horrible cause he intruded anyone(all laugh) and Squttie is still the same but he would rather lecture after somehow hitting you,this brat would make you ashamed among people(all laugh)..first time the brat was upto his game I scoffed at him saying I’ll forsake you to Sceptie’s bushes(all laugh),this irritation was expressed by you only cause you distributed your combination of your idea of yourself and the other not matching their’s failing to recombine you as yourself isn’t it comarde(all burst into laughter,Violet and Brock uncontrollably laugh)..see this idea of you on me being in direct communication with different combinations of beings(all laugh a lot) is only so cause you keep in yourself the recombined idea of your..anyway then aunty sighs and says Seth look you yourself are 12 and 7 only(all laugh) you don’t know the repercussions dear and they just love you too much so be careful(all laugh),from outside she means in times of personality Seth give them professionalism in mixture which is ever helpful(all brust into laughter,Lillie laughs a lot,Gary shakes his head laughing),you two little brats I’m showing you(all laugh)..then we made faces and fled(all laugh) but later of all people Dulu uncle comes(all laugh),’DON’T SPOIL MY DAUGHTER(all laugh)’,’TIMBER..Cladlie dictates,what did you say Benji won’t be able to cut this tree a damn namecalled Scizor(all brust into laughter)..no no trees were timbered all psychic channels stuff(all laugh) at 12 hence the namecall too in front of everyone(all laugh)..so it was a mayheym(all laugh)..man some days those were you know but atleast not across them we went with a pencil in hand(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..and that was just one side of all of us when we went into our retreats all did some more some less cause they could do it by other means and well me,Sluis and Penny were the only in the more section(all laugh) we used to contemplate on things that were required each day to stay sane despite the psychic onslaught(all laugh)..**


anyway,so thus threw Miette into the Elite4 cauldron(all laugh) now married and all that was 6 years back on the last month actually got married just a few months back says man you scared my youth out(all laugh) has contacts with me exactly from the next day(all laugh) now too frequent..and yeah keeping contacts no matter what means just a case of Belly(laughs,all the rest smiles,Mehadi too smiles in same pose)..infact I remember when I just about realized except for mom,Professor,Myla aunty and all of my uncles and aunties there with my bros and sisters and Zed and Gary(all laugh) there are too many people I asked may be a Kriketune that why are you not me(all laugh) at 3(all laugh) so he said you see lad when you have a particular referrence frame to know yourself you should understand that you’re in a horrible mess sometimes you want to spend time with your beau but if he needs to go to washroom then only mental communication is possible in generalized framework thus none can be that isn’t it(all burst into laughter)..no it’s very true as you know when Cello came I was 7 that time Rachel aunty told me you’ll have another little sis after Quittie I by then knew about naming systems(all laugh) so said um..recently I saw a few new born Celesteelas they too are my sisters(all laugh) so why would the difference persist(all laugh a lot)..so aunty got a clue and fondled me saying cause the name will be Celestia to exist(all laugh)..so that’s how that little pest was named,Questa was Zed’s idea hence too mystic(all laugh) and Zed wad 11 then(all laugh) he started to read things since 6 or 7(all laugh) before that surveyed what to read and how since 4(all laugh) by then said the quest and conquest of ego really caught my imagination(all laugh) so I thought Conquesta then thought that means already conquested yet will be born and will wait to see if cries afterwards as usual(all laugh) cause his perception then was if someone is too advanced won’t cry just because he or she is thirsty but will only when it grips them(all laugh a lot) went there with a stopwatch(all burst into laughter) told Bert uncle of all people of his plans almost tried to write a paper on that there itself(all laugh) then went in told Clarie aunty of this hideous plan(all laugh) that is stop feeding her after just a bit(all laugh),so Zed did the stopwatch and the poor kid just cried her head off(all laugh),Clarie aunty was irritated with both hum at this age still TOO MUCH RESEARCH ISN’T IT(all laugh) and you little brat THIS ISN’T YOUR SWEET SWEET JANGOMO-O(all laugh),um..no I was calculating just a ratio(all brust into laughter),then told them the name Questa and both ate him up on the spot(all laugh) and Aurora was Warden’s idea hence too cryptic(all laugh)..Lucent was againt his idea and yeah it was influenced by Illumise(all laugh) then Tranquila ofcourse(all laugh) then Potentia was Gary’s idea(all laugh)?


..anyway so about scaring youth away,I said exactly what my Nivy tells me to do(all laugh)..anyway back to the youth ages(all laugh) so I say yeah surely pokemon discussions,so you see rotonob-pshycogomic-tycroptin-darkened Mexutu..’(all burst into laughter)..this gets that buffoon to almost fell off her seat(all laugh) first a Mexutu to being with(all laugh)..then doesn’t have one clue about what those are(all laugh)..and the opponent was raftus-progomoic-cystus-Ulisasus(all burst into laughter)..just the greatest boss said(all laugh)..Team Rocket’s signature was..a Mexutu for a day/if an Ulisasus is added with where’s your way out of bay(all laugh)..says,’um..Seth..um..’(all laugh),’you see Miette,this is what you have to know to begin with(all burst into laughter)’..then I talk about dragon-dark types(all
laugh)..and their infightings(all laugh)..what an hour that was..the brat said it’s ok I’ll not take anything(all laugh uncontrollably)..was fed by sentimantal brat friendship card(all laugh) all were fully green dishes(all burst into laughter)..then comes out our brat was disappointed cause Miette got the date(all laugh),’hmm..so quick(all burst into laughter),the brat ate up Clem for 1 and half hours and we were waiting outside for 30 minutes(all laugh)..now I was talking about all sorts of things of a Clafable(all burst into laughter)...which the brat again was almost puked(all laugh)..cause all knows moon dance but then it was shown to be too complicated(all laugh)..then our brat asks why quick,’um..thanks,thanks legendary(all laugh),bye brat,I’m in a hurry(all burst into laughter)...then our brat say,’Seth,what did you do to her(all laugh)’,’brat,have you ever heard of subgenetic testalight phyroblofic thyropnatic trycoon thunder attack(all burst into laughter)...thats Raftosmoric of course(all laugh)’...none of these names of course Clemont doesn’t know either cause it changes it’s forms in dimensions(all laugh)..this one great illusive legend later faced our planing master Feraligator(all burst into laughter)...and you know the legend will be confused forever about type difference(all laugh)...Feraligator said,I see where are your mates,this gets gets the legend very angry that first a water type and then Feraligator is in the bottom of bottom half with their natural type strenghts...so tries to charge at him and you know what charge means for such a legend,’I see you’re mates have forsaken you for strenght(all burst into laughter)’...this gets the legend a bit confused what is he talking about(all laugh)...’no no,I realize,lets talk about how to get back to your mates then(all burst into laughter)...’,the legend retorts like,’what the hell are you trying to get at’,’see,this whole type difference stuff is very fishy(all laugh)...then goes on with his type difference and different attack plans on different types long lecture then asks the lengend to dance(all laugh)...’,’the legend says like,’are you a pokemon(all laugh)’...’see,I’ve plans on pokemon dnacing(all laugh) how to increase the type advantage’(all laugh)...the legend is utterly confused with this cause now the brats wants to know everything about the legend despite knowing the type disadvantage much better than the legend(all laugh)...so the legend says what do you want(all laugh)...’I’m trying to have an understanding on how to plan your friendship back to your group but unless this type differnce is sorted out then its so hard cause you can’t know your own type then and then you can’t be be what advantages or disadvantages you have to get back to your friends without knowing how to cajole them saying how your specific type is good by-the-way do you dance at home(all burst into laughter)? No type difference influences dances and viseversa the more..(all laugh)..’ so finally the legend realizes he has to attack or else this brat will irritate him to death..well I don’t know what gender the legend was actually...anyway,so the legend again tries to attack...’I see too eager(all burst into laughter)..are you sure the plan you have is the same when you’re irritated with yourself when you think that had another plan to eat less I would’nt have had this stomach ache here and there when I tried to pester my friend too much and he and he mouthed me thus this headache(all burst into laughter)..do you dance(all burst into laughter)..(all laugh)...now the legend is totally flattened cause he’s telling him do you attack yourself when you have headache cause you ate more or your beau mouthed you(all laugh) or when you’re depressed cause you’re dumped(all laugh) cause Ferlaigator hasn’t done one thing to anyone and asking him to dance to get over the depression if any(all laugh) and always teaching him how to get back to his mates using his knowledge and then dancing it out..all laugh..and look at the intelligence,never one thing said that will make the legend believe that he’s trying to set the legend upon the legend’s master but just talks about being back to his friends to hit the spot that the legend is not among his own race and thus not able to havemaximum fun with type advantages(all laugh)...so finally the legend gets it that he’s just fooling around innocently and only trying to become his friend and play has not one intention to battle cause he knows he can’t win it and doesn’t bother about it at all and thus the signal that all my buddies gave that we’re no match for you but you’re foolish to attack us cause we aren’t here to battle at all rather you’re charging for no reason what-so-ever,so the lunatic master is here again and is psychid off and then this Raftosmoric was using pshychic attacks and of course Feraligator or anyone can’t be harmed with that at all so the legend realizes and that’s why they are legends that the only difference this guy has is all his limitations in type difference and thus he’s wanting to understand all things about it cause he’s as good as the legend in psychic defense..so the legend was rather trying to tach later(all laugh)..but then you weak and all so went off later but Gary I tell you Raftosmoric has big chance cause he’s the only to get the best planning treatment and loved it,Lillie how about an electric elusive legend for a starter(all laugh)?”
Lillie(laugh) : “will misbehave in the gym(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “so better change profession(all laugh)..AH BEAUTY,BEAUTY(all laugh)..that’s most dangerous though(all burst into laughter)..anyway,Team Rocket was very close with two legends and their whole system against Raftosmoric but ultimately got overpowered with exactly that attack which the legend only used once cause she didn’t want to throw them off cause Mexutu and Ulisasus together was nothing to her tha’s a certain form of thunder-chair but that’s psychic type thunder of some degree not highest at all..which you know(all laugh)...then both travel companion brats realized it’s a wastage of time to talk with me,then Clemont was chided but I was way more polite then(all laugh)...what a night..anyway,so I’ll start with my Johto journey,but please I realize that my sweet bug now changed her style a bit after she returned from Johto,but is there really any chance that ponytails will return?..let me give you the answer Gary,Brock,Mr Fox(all laugh),from there...so this time Melody beats me and I could see the bug.my sweet ponytail knew that I was praising her and all that so didn’t like the fact I’ll go there and in 5 years I never saw her that dejected,then something happened this too Brock you never knew(laugh)...that day evening before party did I sent you away or did you flee the scene(all laugh)?”
BROCK(LAUGH) : “perfectly in-between(all laugh).
Seth(laugh) : “alright with this new dawn approaching(all laugh),may we please approach to the next tme in the play when we meet as you know my 3 little babies will be swearing you otherwise(all laugh)...so Mr jackal(all laugh),anytime.good noon(all laugh,reciprocate etc...)
....................................................................................................................................................
(2 days later mid conversation,5,Tu)
Seth(laugh) : “Johto parting,Brock patered to save himself from Gyaradosing(all laugh) so I see her so dejected first due to loss then due to my praising other people and third the brat liked me(all laugh)..was too close to me,shook hands patted me and so on and most dangerously HUGGED ME(all burst into laughter)..and I’ll come later what happens if I tell my bug that I have a girlfriend so thanks(all laugh)..this was the first day and it she was so deflated didn’t talk with anyone else and so on...and then we came back and my ponytail took her sweet garder off and wasn’t in the ponytail which meant  to show that ‘Seth’ should like me..that was the better friendly bug symbol that she wants me to hug her too sweetly so that she too would very emotionally fondle me..so,I knew that my bug was too sweetened and I came in and straight comes in hugs me quickly then holds my hands and cries her head off almost whispering and her voice is so sweet,‘um..Seth..I’m not a trainer like you..um..but..but..um..you saw me in the Whirl cup right Seth,I beat you there too,in the semi finals..that was a tough competition too..only water types..Seth,I too..um..defeated you..um..but..but I too..’(all burst into laughter)..and actually profusely cries so I reaized that my bug is now flowering up so I just said that ‘yeah,Mehu..um..Mehadi(all laugh)..it was a great..”,”..SHUT UP(all laugh)..namecall competitor(all laugh) was a girl and I become Mehadi..Mehadi..then screams ‘I’m not Mehadi(all laugh uncontrollably)..Mehadi..you..(all laugh)..then breaks down completely..then we all know how sweet my sweetie’s voice is and then a few moments later so so sweetly in tears say..why are you calling me Mehadi,Seth..(alllaugh)..and this is a very serious offence that all the time I must call her Mehu unless someone asks me of her name(all laugh)..that too now must be said yeah my wife Mehu,full name..(all laugh) so then again screams...Seth..how can you..again cries too much..Seth,5..5 year..then screams my name and totally breaks downs almost faints infact,’ well that was the end of 5 years actually and had she stayed for may be 1 more week we surely had to formalize the marriage(all laugh) IN MY ROOM(all laugh)..but Daisyl took her away!away,away,away(all laugh) Hence Daisyl is fed CrawdauntoGatorLerPhlosionSeismiRottZellWhimsiCrossLeafPhox(all laugh) and Conhoopa(all laugh)...so anyway, I hug her very quickly and STAY(all laughs)..then let go(all laugh)..and say ‘Mehadi,put your ponytail up then and only then you’re my best friend Mehu(all laugh)”..these pleases my flower so much that she almost confesses and hugs too violently(all laugh)..thank God I drove the crook away(all laugh)..and yeah the Fox(all burst into laughter)..no that moment if were sketched all right still than a long grave lecture(all laugh)..and if the crook smelt that(all laugh)..then still now after 17 years he would’ve been writing philosophical novels on that(all laugh)..that FEELING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Brock shakes his head laughing)..so my flower giggles and hugs me doesn’t let me go and all and doesn’t say anything either(all laugh)...then I didn’t hug her back cause that would’ve been a bit too sweet for me at that moment(all laugh)...she doesn’t mind though(all laugh)...so I then just pat her and say ‘Mehu,we’ve been friends for 5 long years(all laugh)...we’ll always remain best friends(all laugh)...calm down,take rest I’ll have to go there later so lets talk about pokemons,hum?(all laughs)...my flower was too close for any comfort that day(all burst into laughter)...then looks into my eyes(all laugh)...’um..Seth..I..I..che..um..I..cher..um..’(all laugh)then again just hugs me and giggles(all laugh)...I again pat her back and say ‘right Mehu,our friendship is too cherished by us(all burst into laughter)...best friends(all laugh)...’ she doesn’t say anything just keeps   and I keep patting her back and head now(all laugh) but just a few moments later my flower again gets sentimental... ‘Seth,why are you standing so far away’(all burst into laughter)...now I finally get to play my card that I wanted to for many days,I just quickly hug her(all laugh)..and hold her hand then and say,’Mehu,can I do my best friend’s ponytail today?”(all burst into laughter)...this gets my flower to smile very sweetly and then she again hugs me and then asks,’um..when will Brock return(all burst into laughter)’..’well ample time but I also have to leave lets get on with the ponytail(all laugh)...then my flower tries to do her beauty tricks(all laugh)..but that was my real moment of magic that 15 years later actually was grasped,I say,’um..Mehu,you generally don’t use these so why today are you using all these cosmetics and all these stuffs(all laugh)”...my flower doesn’t quite understand it(all laugh)..says,’um..you mean...then realizes the meaning and again hugs me and says...’Seth,you’re really my best friend(all laugh)..’..I replay..”always”(all laugh)..then again pats her cause in those moments hug means she’ll totally devour me up(all laugh)...then I do her ponytail which was the start only(all laugh)...later I was sweetened to gladly do a few others when I returned ALL FOR ME ONLY(all laugh)...but my thing was that I knew Mehu extremely well except her hairs(all laugh)..yeah Trace and Brock both knows it 12 hours constantly looking at each other(all laugh) and then whole night(all laugh)..now I realized much later when my sis came in and she was my sis exactly but I realized her attitude with Drew and others and I was thinking then that 5 years and I never once thought that Mehu was a girl actually(all laugh) and I had to keep a minimum distance(all laugh)..just looked like a girl(all laugh)..same to her never occurred we’re any different and that’s why we know everything about each other so very well and that was like twin brothers or sisters no trouble at all..but of course the two dumb buffoons were arranging all the time(all laugh),then later realized the NOT- DESTINY(all laugh) and used their wisdom on her own sisters(all burst into laughter)..but Professor is Professor(all laugh)..2 words professor(all burst into laughter)..yeah,later that(all laugh)..so that day did it taking quite a bit of time(all laugh) and then again was upto the old day and this time mostly extremely dangerously for any comfort(all laugh)..we hugged and then I fondled the ponytail and my flower was tendering my hairs as well and just looking at each other no words and actually both were just trying to find the words only but neither wanted to say cause any words were disturbing then and we just continued and knew what we knew(all,smile)...but this,exactly this is the appolocalypse(all laugh)...if that moment continued for may be 5 more minutes and probably would’ve to 50 may be either of us would’ve definitely confessed out of impossibility of suppression and that confession would’ve been just to getmarried immediately after we returned cause later I realized that that really was the hug and the moment of married couple of 10 years,husband and wife after a month long separation due to works(all smile) but then most heinously, a certain crook says(all laugh)-> ‘too sweet hey?(all laugh)/till I’m here it’s at bay(all burst into laughter)/i’ll show you that it’s nay(all laugh)/either you marry,or I’ll play(all laugh)’...so of course as ever at the end there was no point in announcing my marriage to my wife after 22 years(all laugh) and while we both knew about it most vividly but only in intuition and hence our 5 year break-up trouble almost physically killed us both to get rid of the body from the way(all smile)..anyway,that doesn’t happen so the crook comes in,coughs and spits(all uncontrollably laughs,tears,Brock uncontrollbaly laughs)...says,’Seth are you going to the party?’..’what’s that Brock,what’s that?..Seth WILL NOT GO(all burst into laughter)...hum..WHY ARE YOU PESTERING HIM...(all laugh)...I’ll kill you(all laugh)...then I’ve to calm the bug down again but for the first time may be she took my side in front of friends with such emotion of a quarreled-and- patched-up wife(all burst into laughter)...anyway I hold her hands for minutes(all laugh)..calm her down and all then go.but Crook(all laugh)..cough it out(all burst into laughter)...” Brock(laugh) : “no never these too fondling stories,behind my back(all burst into laughter),congrats Seth,16 damn years in due(all laugh)..Mehadi how was it(all laugh)?” Mehadi( oy very firmly and smiling) : “just Seth(all smile).” Seth(patting Mehadi’s head,laugh) : “the Gym opened today finally after 3 days (all laugh)...too sweetened to stay away from husband during in-house work(all smile),so just quarter boiled Brock(all laugh)..caution(all laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “so anyway,Seth finally manages to go(all laugh),then immediately Mehadi almost cries to me just after he leaves after   and ponytailing her for 2:30 hours or so(all laugh) ‘Brock,why doesn’t he like me?’(all burst into laughter) and then after Seth returns first thing,’hum,too melodious hum?’ (all burst into laughter)..Seth,3 hour hard work all vapoured in 2:30 right(all laugh) Seth(laugh) : “Mehadiviously(all laugh)..that was liking now if 3 seconds away after gym shuts,‘hum..getting old right’(all laugh)..Mehadivious indeed(all laugh)..then..then the complain was...’too melodious hum..you’re having your dinner with me(all burst into laughter)...that was 22:30(all laugh)..I was 1 hour late at party(all laugh)...’Mehu,I’m totally full..please,let’s..’ again gets into danger mood ‘WHAT DID SHE MAKE YOU EAT?(all burst into laughter)..hum.too much dancing..too much  ..OR DID YOU DRINK TOO MUCH(all laugh)..hum you you....’..now I see that this is getting serious now so just say that ok,but tomorrow both lunch and dinner we’re going together ALONE(all burst into laughter) and tonight I’ll just take little dessert...calms down a bit...’huh?!?..finally 5 years wants to date(all laughs uncontrollably)..um..(all alugh)..hangout(all burst into laughter)..yeah,yeah,fine YOU’RE PAYING(all burst into laughter)..12:30,20:30...AND I’’LL NEVER DATE YOU(all uncontrollably laughs)..the crook says,’um..’(all laugh),we both in unison say : “get out’(all laugh)...then we date it out the next day and the day after that and the day after that(all laugh)..not allowed to watch the final cause a certain person is there(all laugh)..but that party itself I passed 2 hours with that person(all laugh) and then later watched the reply of the final(all laugh)..Mehu only knew after the 2 words(all laugh) then was ok of course(all laugh) no you know I just wish I was more kind to Melody and she was looking for a travel companion and wanted to go with me infact Mehu then would’ve as well(all laugh) and I would’ve confessed to Mehu that very night itself(all laugh) then the Daisyl’s plans would’ve been gone(all laugh) cause Brock would’ve been sent to Cerulean and that jackal would’ve been forced to come(all laugh) Professor ever says broaden the horizon(all laugh) and Brock at Kanto first said won’t catch any unless come by themselves then first thing caught Crobat said Ah!man!habit you know(all laugh)..didn’t feel it that much still you know cause in gross terms was a dashing gym leader at 25 foraying into contests now with two girlfriends one a full time gym leader one a star singer what else man isn’t it so Doctor Slate what do you feel(all laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “just move it you brat(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “THAT FEELING(all laugh)..anyway,then still got a Magnezone(all laugh) well the again same group and he got the leader me the revolutionary(all laugh),that brat told me today**


so yeah life’s surely hard(all laugh),well Magnezone he caught cause of the situation and we ever got wild brats miffed with our antics or volunteered into their troubles and most times got the trouble makers or the ones that were most involved in either side or in peacemaking process or the silent observers who were most cunning(all laugh) exactly why our brats aren’t exactly sane(all laugh) and was ok cause could’ve been used at gym then finally from Kanto had to have Forretress(all laugh) that was some day first bug then steel direct advantage(all laugh) pulled Brock’s ears off completely and she was 18 Brock was 23(all laugh),hence next day the brat was shifted to AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh),but then Brock has of course Steelix and Golem(all laugh)..DIANCIE(all laugh)..well only Geodude ever and didn’t know what is electric(all laugh) like Marill doesn’t know what is psychic(all laugh) but all the rest evolved still cause they weren’t HUMAN(all laugh) then at Johto he had given up his career such a JEWEL MAN JEWEL we lost(all laugh) hence came of all Ludicolo psychic-grass-water(all laugh) and he’s mad(all laugh) cause was so again as I said was a trouble maker Mehu got the opponent(all laugh) anyway then he had Ninetails of all pseudo-legends ice-fire(all laugh) that brat was the challenger Mehu’s brat was the gym leader(all laugh)..he himself came so had to keep him but then from Hoenn finally has SHIFTREE(All laugh) well after Hoenn Brock shifter Steelix and Geodude cause Steelix evolved and Geodude became WOKEN(all laugh) then since Frontier only had Crobat,Ninetails and Shiftree but they are SO NAIVE(all laugh) and then my schedule meant others had no time to do anything(all laugh),dragged the brat May with me first says YOU CATCH THEM(All laugh) I said yeah Drew is ever right you’re too sweet for this stuff battling is straining your nerves so much I should take more care of you my sweet little sis cause he challenged me that his wife is treated as if already too cunning by her family so caring a hubby aww..(all laugh)..SHUT UP(all laugh)..I will never be his best friend unless he proposes properly(all brust into laughter)..um..that is collaborates well(all burst into laughter)..anyway,hey hey you Entei(all brust into laughter)..yeah at Frontier went to volcanos first(all laugh)..then Sinnoh was something man(all laugh)..Dawnny got only 19 including starter(all laugh)**


and thus Brock should’ve gym battled to let my flower go to me in Unova cause his 3 are enough for his one on one 3 times change(all laugh) cause all you need is that FEELING(all laugh) and I still remember in the last days of Johto before that we both had our ways to fight and get what we wanted forcing the other to budge stubbornly or to cajole each other sentimentally or to pat each other if we were depressed or in her case if she had to complain that Brock or Trace were not letting her pull their ears and hair(all laugh) and all but in the last month before the finals just couldn’t say no to
her(all laugh)..too stricken(all laugh)..and during date won’t sit opposite but beside(all laugh)..always private cell(all laugh)..always that’s the custom cause we sat absolutely in proximity just enough not not to get enough close(all laugh)..the next day was final then another day then returned..actually I only came to know the responsibility mask(all laugh) only in those very last 5/6 days that what my flower will become cause I was talking about life outside the journeys and all and saw how gentle and caring she is about certain things and all..but all intuition and then had to part and all but the play is such that each moment is sweeter(all smile and .)..yeah,now only gym battle and the necessary,all else my job but I can’t be out of sight for
more than an hour if urgent only else except physical needs 1 second(all laugh)..actually my favourite journey in terms of relationship and friends,etc was at my home in that break with my toffee-flower(all laugh)..but still personally Kalos will remain the best ever cause just what I formally learnt in all aspects and could test that on hand as I told you the situations there..anyway,so again when we were in parties,’ahm,excuse me Ketchum(all laugh),you’ve come here under my wing. Remember that (all laugh)...’hum..rather you’ve come due to your intellect’(all laughes uncontrollably)...now this always gets the blossomed flower to absolute despondency that how can ‘Seth’ say he is actually not ‘Seth’...this was the whole hellrounds as you know(all laugh) as I said if somehow ‘Seth’ convinces that he’s not ‘Seth’ or that ‘Seth’ says I’m not his ‘Mehu’ it’s total pitch darkness hence ‘walk behind me’(all laugh)..as soon as she hears it,
she’s so dejected that I have to leave the party immediately and fondle her to death (all laugh)...so she has little tears there and then I say why are you crying we can leave anytime if we don’t like this it’s just a formality... now you can understand the situation and we were 2 years behind the formal confession (all laugh)... somehow she says ‘so cute the girls isn’t it?(all laugh)..fine I’m leaving but you’ll have to return as well(all burst into laughter)...yeah this is 22 year marriage stuff(all laugh) each party was very difficult in Johto(all laugh)...then she again cries ‘hum...what did you say,hum(all laugh)... intelligence, intelligence (all laugh)...you stupid jerk what do you know about intelligence,you...’(all laugh)...then I realize the it was too intellectual for my sweet bug to handle(all burst into laughter) and say alright lets go or atleast lets go to an empty place all will see us..’,then she finally comes to an empty area and grabs my hands and tries to sit on my head(all laugh) and all I say ‘hey we were joking right,why get so sentimental?’(all laugh)...the word sentimental gets her even more distraught and this was the round of 32 party at Johto...then she sobbs ‘you are my best friend (all laugh),how can you say that I’m here to see other boys who aren’t friends(all laugh)...’,and so on,then we have to politely hug it
out(all laugh)...that was the only time then in a public place and thank God none saw us else with Johto I could’ve been disqualified from the championships for not disclosing that I’m married for 22 years(all burst into laughter)...yeah so we hug-it-out saying, ‘sorry Mehu,very sorry if you’re hurt,but hey we’re best friends right(all laugh)... friends joke and these things happen and you’re my best friend(all laugh),look at me Mehu(all laugh),please stop crying and if you don’t want we’ll leave no trouble’...now this gets my flower in
her type advantage (all laugh)... first the hug,then the BEST confession (all laugh) and then sentiments so that I won’t bug her again atleast till the next day(all laugh)...so my flower sweetly says,’yeah..um..no Seth, it’s alright,you can stay,I’llleave...I’m..um..not invited so..’(all laugh)...so then I understand it and say alright I’ll dance only with you,fine then best friend’(all burst into laughter)...’um..yeah... it’s alright as you wish(all laugh)...no we should go,we’ve been absent from the hall for long(all burst into laughter)... let’s go,and yeah, you too are my best friend,Seth,more than best...um..best friend..(all burst into laughter)’,then we enter the hall again and well to my utmost delight I can’t take my eyes off(all burst into laughter) from my better than all friend(all laugh) and danced a bit,which I forced her not to do much cause we were Officially better friends only(all laugh)... anyhow Crook(all laugh)...you couldn’t come that day,but when we returned what did you OBSERVE (all burst into laughter)?” Brock(laugh) : “married couple retuns with other’s arms around (all laugh)/the whole night was thus travelled being abound(all laugh)/scoffs at me they’re just friends very sound(all burst into laughter)/finishes the dance midnight feeding me to the hound(all laugh)..the hound was that I had to manage Chu-bro who was told to fondle me whole night cause Seth was BUSY but Chu needed to be alert(all laugh)..and Golduk was told to misbehave(all laugh)..anyway,again stricken boy (all laugh)...that dance got you through 32(all burst into laughter)”
Seth(laugh) : “better than that(all burst into laughter)...we danced for one full hour when we hardly did anything except ach other(all laugh) and again don’t
know how we didn’t confess that day(all laugh) and it wasn’t the ponytail day but before and not the fisrt hair fondling day and after(all laugh)...then hugged each other AGAIN WITHOUT DANCING for like another hour(all laugh)...no words were spoken though in those 2 hours(all laugh)... except how better a friend we were(all laugh) and pokemons of course (all burst into laughter)...then just before we went back to sleep,my flower asks,’um..Seth...’,’yeah?’,’Seth..um..(all laugh)..have I been a nice friend to you(all burst into laughter)..um..like more than..um..best friends(all burst into laughter)?”,’Mehu,you are like a friend whose even more than best friend (all laugh)…
you’re a very nice person,great
person,best...um..friend(all burst into laughter)’ anyway,we went to bed around 2(all laugh),then I was called at 4:30...’Seth,wake up(all laugh)...Seth...you idiot (all laugh)..’ then as we did all the time blow into the ear(all burst into laughter)...I wake up saying ‘Mehu,why are you awake and I would be too sleepy at noon,I’ll go a bit later today need to
sleep’,’huh?!?..sleep...sleep..you jerk,unless we discuss you’ll be trouble(all laugh)...what do you know about Feraligator..(all laughes
uncontrollably)...well(all laugh)..sorry for the exchange(all burst into laughter)...that’s something for sure(all burst into laughter)... Professor any clue(all burst into laughter)?” Gary(laugh) : “been shifted to the cunning section (alluncontrollably laughs)...” Tracey (laugh) : “yeah,and we already have Muk(all burst into laughter)...but the brighter days shines better (all laugh)” Daisy(laugh) : “I went for an inspection 6 days back, first Crawdaunt tries to misbehave (all laugh) by fondling my Squirtle to death and telling him that he was fondling him as well so that he may give him his pokeball(all burst into laughter) and that he was younger please listen to his advices(all laugh uncontrollably)...but I didn’t see Feraligator (all laugh) and then came back and then wanted to see Starew and then(all burst into laughter)....the brat with that size tries to dance with me(all laugh),then I chide him(all laugh),this is in the outer area,then at this rejection (all laugh) he gets happier (all laugh) and snatches Dewgong and then asks him if like he could do anything for him(all laughes uncontrollably)…
Dewgong of course knows the brat pretty well mouths him off,to which he gets even more happy (all laugh) and tells a few other present there that both me and Dewgong wants to battle them one by one (all laughes)...and you know this is a serious issue(all laugh) so I try to mitigate them,and recall the brat,but he comes out all the time and like laughes at me and all(all laugh),finally he runs out of patience(all laugh) and then I send him back...Seth really I’m so glad that you weren’t unGlaliely stricken that day after Sinnoh(all laugh)...our gym would’ve been a real Circus otherwise(all laugh)...and yes, Crawdaunt is trying to cajole Muk to get his calws on my poor little dolls (all laughs)...to them our rooms etc are big pokeballs(all laugh)...so Crawdaunt is a master in combinatorics(all laugh)...and Professor said just supreme intelligence both those two and that combinatorics test is an once only as well but the cost for testing is huge(all laugh) well they create and next moment break all sorts of intelligence records all of them a few like these two a bit more and Feraligator is cunningly sketched (all laughes uncontrollably)...no,Larry said that if he was a human,he would’ve been fondled by any corporates cause his planning is just amusing cause they can do only so few tricks but he’s doing those for like 16 years or more and everday its new...and Feraligator plans intuitively (all laugh) and then Crawdaunt logically proves the uninsinuability(all burst into laughter)...then the two goes out to fool around and no Trace said like they actually plan a whole day what they are going to do(all laugh)...Feraligator first showed the others that me and Dewgong rejected him(all laugh) and took this chance to set them upon us(all burst into laughter)...it’s just amusing seeing them everyday their playfullness and they can’t breed with their high intelligence and all that and they
have their own types there but just doesn’t bother about anything at all infact Seth,you’ve done way way more than enough for the future anyway(all smile),just that playfullness is so amusing and among all actually (all smile), except that brat Heracross(all laugh) whose goal is to know about everyone’s beaus(all burst into laughter) but Lil,how was the just born fearow(all burst into laughter)?” Lillie(laugh) : “I’m so happy that fearow didn’t stay with Muk more than half an hour cause if the fearow was mingled with for the full day,she would’ve got the whole Pokemon world into grave danger(all laugh)...no their psychic abilities are what makes them legends and if that is Muked with(all laugh),then you can understand what they’ll become (all laugh)...Seth,Mehu only sweetened the Telplocus,and yes Golduck was there(all laugh),he’s been kept sane desperately(all laugh) anyway,if you were there,was there a chance that our gym and lab never again needed to work(all laugh)?”
Seth(laugh) : “well actually it’s not my question is it(all burst into laughter)..no,I met the greatest boss
impersonally (all laugh) just asked him about Telplocus and the highest boss says that yes Telplocus is extremely hard to manage which my flower sweetly did(all . and smile) but said that they were more intelligent than Ulisasus that he managed according to his views and he actually regrets now that he had Mexutu of all and only used the psychic dynamo for bad purposes and it would’ve been a phenomena if Mexutu had been there on that final battle day cause he says Mexutu would’ve realized by the end what Crawdauntogator was doing and actually would’ve tried her best to come with me cause that was something that she didn’t know and her nature being ever free she would’ve been all over me and so that joy
was very enticing and all so according to the highest boss the thing is that at the end of the day no matter how playful all becomes they’ll battle if their master wants them to and the master will want them to if he wants to make a living and he’ll deilfinitely do so cause it’s just like natural oil,unless one uses it he’s being foolish so he said that my bunch is a fluke cause somehow they’ve caught this mood that their master is not at all serious about anything and thus they’re only with me cause they themselves think that the master is a pokemon(all smile)...yeah the soulmate stuff(all smile) and said that my condition wouldn’t have arrived had I not been born like this and thus opined that the whole thing is indeed a fluke in history.but he also said,actually the idea to realize that Pokemons are just a sport like football or that if this idea isn’t firmly ingrained lenegdaries can never be tamed cause to him legendaries are so intelligent that their premise to come with you must be oiled everyday otherwise they’ll believe they’re being bounded and would start troubles exactly what happened with Ulisasus,Ulisasus according to the greatest boss wasn’t intelligent at all,half grown brat(all laugh)...so he charged at Mexutu all times cause to him except thegreatest boss and a few others all were enemies and Metwtwo was taken aback but the highest boss said he made the mistake of taking Mexutu for granted cause she was 6 long years with him and was very well tamed but of course that was done illegally but still to legendaries illegality also is a subtle stuff,but anyway so Mexutu somehow
caught the mood of the highest boss and thus became ferocious cause to her she was being abused thus the two legends were incessantly at each others throats and then the greatest boss had to terminate them both cause the boss says his cruelty or like that had to be olied in Mexutu so that she stays in that mood but as Ulisasus came in and all,that same cruelty now Mexutu felt she was being now subjected thus revolted,so to the highest boss having two legends was his downfall that on that fatefull day he didn’t have either but again said that no they actually would’ve turned on him understanding my bunch if they could that is and all exactly what my
beloved half grown fearow(all laugh) could’ve had he been with the greatest boss cause the brat that had fearow was a true brat(all laugh) so barely had any brain except abusing and thus not one idea about the master was ingrained in his own way to the fearow and that’s exactly why the great boss is the greatest cause first he’s the only man alive and known in the last 230 years or so history to manage two legendaries together at the same time despite their infighting so he has something about him and he could imbibe cruelty and keep it same for so many years and actually that being honest with himself that he was cruel(all smile)...that stuff is why he was so jovial once that self imbibed idea broke down and all but then my beloved Unovan friends were trying to better him and thus the mass havoc with 230 legendaries throughtout whole region turning up everywhere and were sweelen up to absolute hell and what not,then there were the 4 bufoons,total lunatic and trigger happy,230 battlers and support crew all psychic or grass set ups a few fires and all...those brats all they knew was to just go and bust and all my poor Goodra was trying to do was to get their lunacy away so that the legends calm down cause those 4 were like wakes up and tries to kill the first person they see so all were lunatics thus my buddies had to calm them down a bit and Goodra managed the legends but was trying to affect the brat managing it a bit as I said and the brat didn’t understand why his legends was confused so went to full infatuation overdrive and 2 other compeers,his lackey human legends and legends and unlegended pokelegends and all just lost is completely and I jumped to save Goodra and also my own mind was affected and all then the accident happened just my body couldn’t absobe all their insanity cause I also was so connected with Goodra and just a total mess and you know my mental condition in general then...firstly I don’t know know why I left despite all and lastly I don’t know how Bayleaf managed to get the last brat off and then get out of there alive and all my buddies are fine even Charizard and it to me still is just funny because I got 7 days whether before with that perfect setup having defactore from team rocket it self and that too James of all people who knows me and viseversa for all those years and I got 21 days with all supports imaginable and I had no personal responsibility and this time those brats at Unova Elite4 were at total loss having lost both their heads and I just literally jumped into the fire with nopreparation by every means what so ever,then I wake up,don’t know how came to hospital might be Nivy not sure also how can all 230 know which is a pokemon centre so perfectly,and they first thought I wasn’t alive cause I was in coma for 6 days with no one fully knowing my identity as hero or villian in those islands and somehow they later realized that it might not be and some of my heads came to know and all but on the 8th day they take Goodra out which they said were difficult cause Goodra himself was at complete bay for the first 3 days but then on 4th he became ferocius and wanted to see me which they did and he instantly realized I was still alive at least and didn’t do anything,it was that final ultimatum mode of Goodra then later I call him he doesn’t do anything at all but tries to again destroy everything much later I realized that he had the thing under control but I rather jumped too early to save him and to him it was the all the human opponents fault cause he had to take care of the legends and couldn’t take care of the human brats physically so to him I was in danger cause those brats and so any human came to me was his enemy anyhow I calm him down and all..Nivy was there with Goodra and he only managed him to calm down and Nivy was much calm throughout the 7 months and I realized when he came to me and was trying to fondle me to hell which I somehow resisted to him it was that he had got everyone off but he just thought he already lost me and that’s why he made others to calm down after we managed to get off the spot..(laugh)..always had a dream of managing all 235 at the same time while being away from almost all and they did exactly that..all my buddies were injured to hell and all were scattered throughout the whole landmass of Unova and all..just their intelligence and playfullness alone got them regrouped and come back to us...but I still was a villian,then finally(laugh)...they saw Goodra and realized I wasn’t the villian cause Goodra was just ferocious that day and yet with other pokemons he behaved well just told them he can’t trust their masteres that they won’t harm me themselves which was later sorted out..and then of course Percy comes in around 15 days later(laugh) and all that..but I just wished Lance was there cause he would never have jumped into fire like Percy and Lubos did..Lubos just thought that I could manage and himself was sorry that he never knew that no preparation was done in Unova at all before he thought I was sabotaging him and Percy being so young and basically totally unsuited for this administration was at complete bay cause Kalos didn’t bother as their method is see legend terminate legend if misbehaves every hall of fame gym had it which I visited both times and you know what will happen if the equal money and power sharing go away and the current great bunch of gym leaders are sabotaged and it will happen next week anyways,Kalos had their own issues,not a single region was sane including Sinnoh who had ardently followed our beautiful Kanto legends and Hoenn later tried their hands at it too and Johto never knows which side to sail to and Pasio was doing all those there and I can’t believe Lubos wouldn’t say a thing trying to resist the great Pasio perfectly knowing about Mehu then my relations with her and what she was going through and then knowing what moment my sis was in didn’t resist that as well cause he of all people started to believe that I might’ve done something wrong indeed cause I got all that fame after undercover...just totally flustered and lost his head,not one Elite4 head kept their head then and that’s exactly why Lance was needed cause he alone could’ve got this mess through in the very beginning letting the Kalos hall of fame loose first on Unova so that all the gyms get together to create the first resistance knowing Kalos’s termination system which Percy thought can’t be disclosed to minutely...I really was laughing that how can they make mistakes after mistakes for 12 months and not pay any heed to anyone depite Professor Kukui constantly telling Lubos that legends can’t be tamed unless you can create a strong attacking system and support Seth Ketchum’s bunch so that they don’t have to be distracted to protect everything as well just like in team rocket’s time when our well being was more on us than our bunch and not try to defend all time against legends cause you can’t and that’s exactly what my flower’s bunch realized due to Goldy’s heightened powers and his connection with Mehu,who was threatened for one moment and thought of the ultimatum despite telling others to defend but that mood Goldy picked up and Starmie and Poliwrath was told and thus Chu was called in on 2-1 vote(laugh) with type advantage and took about 5 minutes to get rid of the grave danger.but then above all the greatest,way higher in immortality what to speak of any kind of pokemons or mere mortals is obviously our very own beloved Kanto who has surpassed all expectations in power hunger,greed and most dangerously omniscience so that a man like Lance was forced to step down because he didn’t battle me properly and like let me goeasily and defamed the hall of fame cause he was the strongest Elite4 and rather reciprocated my playfull style thus some authorities despite my swearing were saying now that none knew where I was you have to step down just after 4 months since our battle and Simon was defamed cause he supported Lance through and through and they got the Kanto Grand Conference totally too much involved which has many true once only jewels themselves as Drew told me later,and Lance knew about unovan trouble but definitely not what it actually was and he didn’t want me to get involved at all but all else forced him to oblidge though he did tell me to be cautious of even the heads no matter what and he regretted than he can’t help at all cause the knife was at his throat and if he budges now Kanto withing months would create fearow bunch and destroy everything legally itself and then the Kanto said this guy does too many undercovers and gets the leeway,something is wrong definitely so lets start infighting over him and get rid of Lance..this also was a fluke in history that the whole pokemon world came at blows at the same time and truly Lubos should’ve been wise enough having seen it first hand 3/5 years back I just was the go to man then I was the suspect villian and Percy never realized anything about the seriousness,45 now,we all know him,one of my favourites as well,he is ranked just belowe me all 6 league victories and all 7 Elite4 wins,only person except Dave and Marc to beat Lance in the last 15 years,once ever talent but administration is Kanto business..then Katya was there who is 80 now she is actually better than these but is now out of professional world for 10 years and can’t battle legally and you know 72 is last after that there’s no chance of it cause none wants it after 60 continuous(laugh),she knew me but she was ever enthusiastic in such things cause herself did a few in her heydays and Laure vs Katya is legendary as you know..anyway,Percy tells me the Telplocus story(laugh)...that Chu bro threatened a whole 16 strong Telplocus brigade to such degree that Pasio Elite4 had to admit that they can’t do much about my sweetie’s actions either
after getting the news...still tried to test him(laugh)..and Mehu told me later that if there were 160 Telplocus’ still Chu would’ve been able to threaten them cause for such a tiny pokemon in an island sourrounded by ocean and threatens legendary water electric types before his own friends having Golduck with all his powers and his face was like he was laughing that why 16 bring me 600 and those overzealous Telplocus’ who tried those psychic stunts got totally decimated cause my bunch is fully immune and realizes too well about dark-psychic attacks unless for their own bunch who only can get under the skin of the others cause it’s all fun and then that final thunder- chair demo was shown and the brats just happily accepted the poor Telplocus who never knew what to do in the full 35 minute stand,and then the 17 went away without one more word...Chu told my flower’s bunch to just get him if attacking is needed cause he is the distinct type advantage and they knew his powers by then and Starmie did exactly that cause she fully realize as Goldy asserted that Mehu feels physically threatened and wants the ultimatum mood no matter her commands and they weren’t being able to defend at all against 16 legends though Golduck was still trying to not get Chu involved cause he wasn’t sure whether Chu was pshychic immune or not cause of his temperament and that too against 16 brats who got Godly and rest totally cornerd with psychic attacks only for my sweetie’s sweetness to send the signal constantly that she doesn’t mean any harm at all..but Chu’s discipline was amusing that didn’t do a single thing in all those that happened no matter what till he was called as Mehu never told him to,while Mehu was physically threatened he I guess if not exactly still did understand the seriousness still didn’t get involved cause his original master was someone else who told him that he won’t see him again and nothing else and thus waited for Mehu’s bunch to ask him and he would’ve only come out if he sensed the psychic attacks were now affecting Mehu and him and Mehu was really vulnerable,he would just have busted and truly could’ve electrulate the whole sea there killing all that brigade with others and dying himself in the process cause his second master now too was about to go in front of him,just infinite numbers of thunder-chairs and self heal in no time to destroy anything in opposition,none can stop him in that mood except my leader Bulbasaur and Mime and Gengleye and no not even me cause these 4 to him are more trusted than me myself(laugh,shakes head) in emotional situations according to his interpretation cause Bulbasaur is leader,Gengleye are themselves masters in dark arts and are with me always and both by nature most jovial so they can pick up my real mental signal anytime and Mime is cause she stays with mom and has a similar responsibility...but that disciple was amusing even went into pokeball and just at right moments came out to threaten human brats in offices whotried to misbehave and once they saw him they realized it’s not good to mingle too much with this lenegdaty lunatic dynamo..if it was me in my flower’s place,Chu would’ve done the exact opposite..anyway,I later got the beautiful men of all gorgeous men via phone which was an experience itself cause of what Chu did(laugh)..first,they asked about my health and my bunch and all then infact cautioned me to never get involved no matter what unless my own home was threatened cause to them the legends has increased the frequency cause they want to make permanent homes and can’t find the way on how to balance it with humans,which is a big topic recently as we know and thus said certain people are ever too ready to be too greedy so I better be ever unready else they’ll drag me each week of the year through the whole world and even told me not to not keep any realtions with any Elite4 heads except Kanto due to obligations cause they temselves aren’t sure whose bossing them anymore and regretted that Lance had to step down like that and I spoke about Percy to them to which they say yes Percy is good but they are not sure whether he can keep his nerves like Lance ever did if his own office is infighting or irresponsible for 10 years just like what Kalos exactly is for 50 the riches are the shackle but anyway they told that Pasio Elite4 was alright now cause the head was removed and all,they weren’t much harmed as usual ccause they never mingled and slyly changed designations at the very first spotting of Telplocus as their boss were trying to get too interested and thus they realized they better flee the scene as had a premonition of doom to they shifted into the Conference based system via their fiancee’s status and said were saved due to that cause they were in grave danger cause the previous designation was right inside the trouble then they rather calmly told that they were really taken aback suddenly seeing Mehadi of all people cause they never expected why she would go to them due to their designations and her requirements were different then when they saw Chu realized the deal and the seriousness of the situation as Chu as he picked up the uneasiness of my flower,straight came out of pokeball just in time to calmly sit down beside Mehu(laugh) while sparking infrequently in the smallest possible amount with as usual that sweet adorable face to just give you the hint that he’s ready all the time but is too playfull too and how he behaves is upto how he and his group including humans is treated,cause he just realized that it’s human matter that he didn’t understand but he was ready for one breach of line to thunder-chair anyone as I told him minutely the half foot circle in case of uneasiness in me myself so many times during my Elite4 journies,recalled that perfectly and then matched it up with Mehu having the idea that we were always together and it goes back to the beginning as well so it may mean the same thing...what an intelligence to guess even the second master all because she was his main masters solmate thus similar relation to them themselves however they interprets it and Chu interprets it,soulmates indeed(smile,all smile)...(hugs Mehadi very firmly and forcefully closes her eyes,Mehadi hugs Seth very firmly as well smiling with tears)...and that’s exactly why he is who he is...(all smile)..anyhow they tell me that seeing Chu they realized that its not anything else but the current matter as they knew the moods of water empress in certain issues very well and that of my dissappearences and what was going on around me in the media but they said Chu signalled that it’s just about his current master,so they said that yes we did what we were asked to later we came to know that she agreed jump into the fire on rather being compelled to and be all alone almost in nowhere against incensed legendaries anyway,then they just said the trouble was cause the head just lost her mind with all those legends in greed and wanted to feign via Mehu to get the Telplocus herself which she failed in as Brock intervened just in the right time with uncle as he was told to and that was the only reason why no more bigger fiasco was created for their own benefit casuse Chu truly would’ve killed their bunch off along with themselves thus setting that brigade on the Pasio Elite4 cause they would’ve realized the true villians and would’ve gone nuts about it and then I was just the Ocean and a much of a landmass away(laugh) with 230 poor pokemons and 4 great buffoons but then the beautiful men just solemnly added that this won’t be the end this particular situation of the whole Elite4 systems to come into blows will again happen later if not sooner and if not to such a degree to which I had to concur and then just asked how they themselves were with the positions no matter the designations to which they said they’ll remain safe cause of their skills and success and that’s the whole trouble is all about cause the more that is the more leeway you get in Elite4 without proper testing in highest levels,which again I had to concur then I asked about Chu’s testing to which they said it was a disgrace on their whole Elite4 indeed and they had the first handexperience of a battle themselves so said despite knowing all my bunch might’ve tried to snatch Chu away which was thwarted by all sane people at Pasio and also given Oak Lab by then was all behind me and Percy finally realizing that my bunch could be abused and thus compelling them to self destroy thus was up in arms with every Elite4 head cause his own Electrolite was abused at a test centre in his 3rd journey at Kanto of all places though that was just a mistake but Kanto you never really know...and then much later Percy said they grabbed Chu tested at the best test facility,(laugh)...the brats want to start from thunderbolt,gets thunder-chair to a high degree,all were barely alive and Chu-went upto a guy and as he does bit his nose(laugh)..he realized what idiots they were(laugh)..so they realize that if you keep Chu away from my flower may be 10000 km,you can’t quite stop the thunder chair to not help my sweetie if she just mentally wanted it at all and then those idiots silently fled the scene hadning Chu over to Tracey...those 12 months has been real fiasco as after everything all tries to go after me in legal battles dragging my first undercover teammate and his whole family now that they realized that I was in type disadvantage again and Knato of all leads them(laugh)..but I’m only happy that first no pokemons were killed including my bunch mosty because of grass/psychic and the fire gyms we were too lucky but these 4 buffoons did only this right thing by not getting 230 pure-fire legends cause then dad had to return on an emergency call(lugh)...but the next group of buffoons to pop up next month will do exactly that the first thing
and we know where most fire gyms exists so my home may be threatened...anywaay,all the legends has been taken care of and let go of that’s the greatest thing and that other human brats out of that group alive are with the greatest boss to atleast learn to be proper criminals and not buffoons..and I’m very happy that only those 4 utter buffoons including a few of their ardent disciples are being treated at hell or heaven so that they become a bit saner next time they return to try their hands at crime(laugh)...finally and lastly the greatest boss comes to know all and receive all the surviving brats under his wing very gladly and told them that if he could get 230 legends he would’ve quitted cause he atleast strived for the illusive that he will understand all about the legends and make all else hostages and not just do what the buffoons were upto cause they would’ve destroyed all of their own things and they got that in front of them in a plate cause of the legend trouble and Unova Elite4 totally fell apart..utter idiots creats a fiasco like that for 27 months...anyway,whatever,Crawdanut was with me with Goodra and even when almost dead the brat tried to spoil other pokemons at the centre and Feraligator actually invaded the pokemon centre demanding he and his friends be treated otherwise even in that condition he tried to dance upon anything(laugh)...the moment the danger got over all were so happy again..some bunch I have and they proved why they are 235 legends together absolutely once ever...(all smile and .)..I send Bulbasaur back after 3 and half or 4 months via proxy through Kukui lab which was my last contact with sanity and tell him to get a second battelion ready and all so that they may come later to me if needed,Bulbasaur doesn’t want to come that Chu wasn’t with me but Infernape tells him that if they return then who will look after them and the others which Bulbasaur realized and budged and Muk to was sent back with him though he being the only one to face a legend was important but he’s just too dear to me as has a lots of type disadvantages and Professor Oak and all and he is a very rare breed which Kanto desperately wants to delete so sent him back,(laugh)who forced the alarm Gary..? Gary(smile) : “Bulbasaur...was ferocious after a certain point I guess they are extremely well tuned as well somehow...later told you that when he returned he just asked GuzzLord who specified a limit and then Bulbasaur was angry after that was crossed and I guess it’s about his own judgement of each one’s strenght and temperamnet and he saw those legendaries and those 4 brats and all probably gauged something and almost killed me because I wasn’t listing to him and as you told him created the second battelion with Muk as deputy recuited the other groups yet Mime was kept far away,Chu didn’t know a thing when he was here and then Chu wasn’t himself bothered about any of his buddies and finally Seth of all people and actually threatened Mehadi to not mingle him with any of his buddies after she returned which is miraculus really as we always say follow the command not the general,this is exactly that which all 235 did even including Mime.Bulbasaur was all at it and Muk was ever with him and was extremely scary himself which we all thought was because grandpa couldn’t be with him all time who only realized this second battelion stuff later,really it was scary we called emergencies causeBulbasaur won’t say a word and become ferocious and a lot others weren’t happy either and all but then Bulbasaur suddenly invaded our home of all places which Muk got him in and I don’t know how and straight tried to attack grandpa only to be dissuaded by Muk then grandpa told me its about the second battleion and he is asking us to send them to you and they have a full battelion ready cause something might’ve happened to you and Bulbasaur after returning sensed it and grandpa unfortunately was bed ridden at that time and thus Bulbasaur couldn’t get to him and he was instructed to ask him only then leave if he permits and truly none in the world except my grandpa would realize instantly about the second battelion and would tolerate Muk for all these years only cause Muk ever was so fond of him and Muk’s nature was like that.Bulbasaur never even told me that he wants to see grandpa nor Muk cause you told them to directly meet him and never involve us cause he knew the second battelion would’ve been ferocious and would only budge to grandpa and we may not be able to interpret it cause it was secret and may be you and your bunch could do it ever to such a degree but Seth’s biggest ever fear is that his wife and his brothers would lose their heads in such cases and which certaily we now realize has more than enough validity to believe in cause we saw first hand what happened and we were about to lose our heads as well only for grandpa again to councel us..Gradpa said second battelion was ever done with maximum 8/9 outsiders if the trainer was too extremely good and we had about 8 times more..anyway,I think we were just about a 8 days late...then grandpa tells me after about ¾ minutes with Muk and Bulbasaur constantly kept saying just that ‘Master wants us’ and even then won’t directly say more and Bulbasaur was constantly vine- whipping Muk who was making faces and like that to say that it was a very serious issue and just hint the second battelion and more brutally as you told them to empty the lab again and again,they themselves were trying to get the third ready too to use cause you know a quite a few are extremely fond of some of your bunch and they try fondle you like their own master so those probably was tried as well as Mime suddenly wanted to get involved dragging aunt here after we started our own procedure and was always talking with a few here and doing her psychic tricks upon them to agitate them and they were at Tracey’s ears whole time to try to get him to use them and our pokemons themselves became volcanic whenever we called them out,our bunch always told us they are all ready for a real fight,Brock had to do it once in Pasio and Mudkip was too dangerous...grandpa said Seth’s ever constant playfull threat of emptying the lab is exactly this they won’t let us live here unless you atleast try to find Seth with them,then I contancted Lubos who doesn’t a thing except you were in grave danger and yet suspects that your motives weren’t saintly and none knew where you were then we had to wait for a week to even get to know what actually was there,then we go to Pasio and Unova respectively and then came to know what happened and then that Telplocus stuff of all-they get Mehadi involved even in that situation and throw her in similar stuff if not worse only cause she was the best with water pokemons and most heinous thing was that they were playing games with her using you as they do and then she can’t contact us and gets virtually stranded in nowhere and all that and then finally that legal drama which really got upto our nerves-I just wish you don’t go anywehere away from us in this life again Seth except the 11 city circle and even I’d say not much in Yellowburst and if urgent then only Pettlesberg and Pettlesberg won’t call you ever now even in most urgency that we know.Lance not being there anymore I don’t trust the Elite4 either no matter how good they have been to us cause these idiots should understand that you have your life and not drag you anywhere just because you’ll help and the worst thing was they were absolutely at bay with everything and tried to fetch those brats with 230 legends and no you shouldn’t be involved with Yellowburst gym either in case there’s a hint of undercover stuff cause we don’t trust anyone anymore unless it’s in our family or extended ones...and also next time a fearow comes I’ll empty the whole lab on the brat so that atleast you and Mehadi can show how to manage legends..all the bunch recovered well and Chu was so happy to return to Mehadi...and his temperament has got a bit better bit more playfull and no those 16 Telplocus’ brigade would remember what exactly is type disadvante for years...and then(laugh)..as you said the brats wanted still to test him of all(Seth laughs)..Tracey said Chu just came out as if he was expecting a mountain and got a peeble and then that legal drama(Seth and Gary laugh others smile)...absolutely the authorities got what they deserved for sure..and Mehadi had Chu more than you ever had in all situations even in pokeball..and then the great Kanto wouldn’t let the gym get shut and was trying to get thefrontier symbol back again but Mrs Slate and Kane managed that beautifully always keeping it open just for 4 days and going real full steam at anyone with Dewgong in charge citing their incompetence if they pestered around and then going off for a week citing pokemon exhaustion and complaining abuse and challenger quality and behaviour 3 times did it they realized the game got off us and the great Kanto Grand Conference was decimated by Drew as usual with his tactics and calmness,those brats were saying that you also corrupted that stuff with your ribbon and all,didn’t get upto May then though cause of her maternal leave and different region which their beloved Hoenn students suddenly out of their slumber did and obviously Mr Maple was there with all his Hall of Fame powers which was very crucial for us otherwise we would’ve never been allowed to even reach you but he too was almost all alone cause of the accusions that he was the reason why you won Hoenn(Seth laugh) and then linking your sis of all(Seth laugh and shakes his head) but the whole family did shield it from May beautifully via Max who just kept her distracted via her maternal leave privacy itself,later you know Max got all those pokemons whom he personally knew together and Vidonia too was ever beside him,real family Seth,sure(all
smile)...but I saw aunt as well once she picked up Mime’s notes,told her she’s free to leave her and go to the lab if you have told her so after 4 times she dragged aunt to the lab forcefully and she’ll be ok which Mime didn’t do cause that was her instruction and then later aunt told grandpa that she knows all about Mime so (laugh) even she said that if needed she can atleast tell Mime to just battle and Mime will do it all by herself(Seth laughs and shakes his head) so if Mehadi needed her she could go(Seth laughs)...really Seth,you were here for 15 days or so ever doing all those and each word came true including your final ultimatum that probably way surpassed your expectations...”
Seth(laugh) : “yeah I guess but the biggest mistake they did was to involve my wife in it first and then my sis in her maternal leave...I don’t understand what they think of people that you can drag ladies in their most important phases of life and just run them around because they are great professionals or are successful this is why I just can’t forgive Lubos of all ever no matter what he did during undercover how great he was to me...the whole Sinnoh group was doing your empowerment process and I was so assured but then calles them back after his suspicion over over me and then only for Professor Kukui,Birch and Naomi to prevent that thing from happening and then of course legends were after the Oak Lab now that Professor was unwell and bed- ridden and then drags the whole family in..I never knew Unova was such a big issue otherwise I would’ve made sure that Lance knows it full well and let me into the Knato Elite4 and take charge of the Undercover properly planning with Lance and the simplest solution was to get the greatest boss involved with researchers and according to him set up the tame-legend plan cause non else knows more about them on hand and then force all Elite4s to use it-nothing would’ve happened then..cause I would’ve got Johto giants involved too where most fearows are found and created a group with atleast 5 and let them loose with my bunch as leaders and see what can any human or pokebrat do about it..Johto remained static as Knato wasn’t doing anything so they won’t either and Johto didn’t get involved only because I didn’t win that league and never were harsh to them to my utmost misfortune,otherwise I truly had to get a herd of fearows and set them upon Johto itself to create another Unova but to fondle any gym to death...but (laugh) mom getting involved is the biggest thing totally unimaginable for me,I ask her what was that and said no Mime picked up your mood and I just thought I should go too that both of you were out..then I had to tell her everything I knew about dad,I and Mehu were doing in absolute minute details and she rebukes me and all that...that was what I never expected(laugh)..3rd battelion well I thought I must myself had to be here but Bulbasaur,Muk and even Mime managed it amusingly just picking up my rage when I said empty the whole lab may be 10 times rather unknowingly in that mental state just before leaving as I realized I’ve made a mistake and don’t have any means to rectify it or be able to tell Mehu even despite knowing it cause I just had passed the point of no return cause I had to be with my bunch then without any compromise.when I sent back Bulbasaur and Muk I only told them again the 2nd battelion throughly and nothing else cause I wasn’t emotionally disturbed anymore but they of course saw the sweet buffoons and lunatic legends and knew what we were up against,Muk never wanted to return I forcefully told him Bulbasaur will be fried to ashes if the whole fire group misbehaves during the creation because of Typhie agitatig them too much beforehand to come with me and now Bulbasaur doesn’t wantsome certain ones cause they know very well that fire types are hard to tackle if too agitated and I or Infernape never had enough time to calm them down so Muk must be there..fire types as ever are my biggest concern due to their moods and we have the most insane ones among them as Magmorter(laugh,Gary shakes his head)..so anyhow that was done and then(laugh)..it was the fires most recuited in second battelion due to my rage they thought they had to be real destructive and got the fires most who followed suit already by being agitated then later knowing the reason...whole 15 Magmorters,who were abused before would’ve created a mayhem there in grass and fire gyms once they knew their new found life was in danger which was Bulbasaur’s trick knowing that it was grass gyms..my few colleagues there was good but it was just too hard for them to comprehend and I let 8 groups with 10 memebrs and let them go and kept the rest 11 with me,they did it almost all by themselvs and only my colleagues knew and supported me later cause they saw what my bunch did first hand and how they saved them all the time..(laugh)...had a dream of managing 235 at the same time scattered all over againt greatest legends certainly came to fruitation with 230 mostly unknown legends there...and another dream to face and tame lenegnds well face I did just too many times against too many and don’t want to anymore of that and tame my soulmate did(all smile)...too much mastery for too many lives(all smile)...that 3rd battelinon is which truly does surpass my expectation by miles for sure and I guess your own bunches would’ve created with Mime’s help the 4th and 5th truly emptying themselves on the whole world to find me and my bunch and hunt down any hindrence even humans-that was a real scare indeed which I still feel is there I’ll need more time with them to calm them down especially that Magmorter groups sub-leader,leader and rest very happy but that brat still is ever unhappy that he wasn’t needed in full force for which he was dying really(laugh).Chu would do that I knew but mom to get agitated is absolutely unbelieveable too me...took dad’s final details very calmly and finally told me never to leave as I didn’t need to from any prospects and that’s all..I only wish they don’t electruculate the whole sea...total m.. creats these situations and gets destroyed exactly there..you still don’t know behind the scenes stuff well..got upto the gratest boss of all that if he can say I of all was an actually opposite gang(laugh,Gary and Brock laughs and shakes their head)...told them some names and asked them if they knew these and how to use these on a darknend-Mexutu to abuse her while she is battling then told them they may be haven’t seen one except in a picture dictionary(both and Brock laugh) what to speak of abusing and that to which will only affect during certain moments and moves in a battle with certain types(all laugh) and then just told them that before accusing someone they should stay with him in confinement cause quote ‘the unconfined world seems to lack even the most common sense these days’(all laugh) and that’s exactly why that man should’ve been involved in this system and then they got to those 3 asking of my deeds during undercover as you know all people were pulling stunts on me and Lubos didn’t know or wanted to stop them cause of their positions and all so get to those 3 and they just said as they’re so interested on how people live in underworld business they can take Mewoth at their home and get the demo(all laugh)..so they got totally flattened in this two places that biggest enemies were praising me...and you know their final plan was to check of all the Crawdauntogator(all laugh)...the infinite compassion saved them there but I’ll still send them again to Kukui lab if needed cause still one or two people are at my ears and they’ll get the fun for life there...Brock how was Cili?” Brock(laugh) : “more ardent fan of yours(all laugh)...Unovan Wisdom finally dawns upon him that indeed then ‘mam was right after all(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “so we’re competiting now(all burst into laughter)...anyway Professor,as I was saying,so my sweet flower says “hmm..what do you know of Waterflower(all laugh)..
(whisper,”Mehu!Mehu!your tears so sweetie!”,hugs Mehadi firmly and then again tenders her head,Mehadi smiles while  oy firmly all the time) sorry was tendering my petals(all laugh)...so she goes about how water Pokmeons should be used and all,then I say,’Mehu,I’ll be too tired tomorrow’,’why I’ll see that you get a good sleep at noon,get up’...so noon comes and all were mouthed off(all laugh) and then gently puts me to sleep and then Crook,what was the narration?” Brock(laugh) : “I think we need more of your dating experiences” Seth(laugh) : “great,this on from dance party again Kalos that brat was trying to dance with me,got her friend(all laugh)...”um..Seth,this”..”’mam,I’ve got a speciality that you may not know/i can do many move but you must bend like perfect bow(all laugh)/but then that’s exactly where comes my glee/cause when you’ll straightened up by then I’ll flee(all bursts into laughter)...I said look,I do non-body contact 2 foot circle dance(all laugh),while talking about half grown Fearows(all laugh)...so just went in the hall half a minute come back,done(all laugh)...Crook(all laugh)” Brock(laugh) : “Brock,um..did you see Seth..”,’sleeping looks extremely cute’(all burst into laughter),’um..no always so,als,anyway(all laugh)..then talks for few minutes about how grass types are bad except Seth’s bunch(all laugh)..Brock,um..he might’ve woken up..um..shouldn’t you keep an eye on him whether he’s properly sleeping(all burst into laughter) or not..I mean sleeping at all or daydreaming(all laugh)...you know my dre(all laugh)...um..bad dreams(all burst into laughter)..”,’Mehadi,I’ve known you two for 5 long years,why don’t you guys just confess and start a relationship ?..it’s ridiculus this childish behaviour of deferring(all laugh)..’..sobbs now(all laugh)..’but..but..he doesn’t like me..(all burst into laughter)..he didn’t let me say I cherish him,he didn’t hug me yesterday properly(all laugh)...he..he doesn’t take me to parties cause he thinks he’ll be ashamed..he..that..(all laugh)..”,then I just say that why don’t you take rest as well(all laugh)...’huh?!?you support him then(all burst into laughter)..support him behind my back..
(sob)..you...I HATE YOU TWO(all burst into laughter)...I’ll show you Brock,you...you want me to be away from my..my..(sob)..(all laugh)..’,’Mehadi wake him up after an hour and half I’m going to sleep(all burst into laughter),’um..alright I’ll look after my..my..um..friend Seth then(all laugh)..best friend..so..(all laugh)..um..you get out and NONE SHOULD BE AROUND MY...um..just GET OUT(all burst into laughter) thus back to the fearow(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “yeah then the most daysed person in the world calls whose a devil as Daisyl(all laughs uncontrollably)” Daisy(laugh) : “too eloquent I see(all laugh)...Mehu,we’re out for a tour,come back or the Gym will shut for 6 months..bye’(all burst into laughter)...we didn’t call her back the next day neither did she call(all laugh)...Sarah tells us..”um..Daisy,that boy..(all burst into laughter)’...’yeah,Seth Ketchum,Pokemon Master general hall of fame(all laugh),Pallet,Kanto,Pasio double Champion,6 years travel just infatuation(all laugh uncontrollably)...don’t let the brat in(all laugh)...but I’ll ever remember how he threatened anyone that hindered his way in the gym,calls everyone sir or ‘mam,next moment becomes Dase,don’t try me(all laugh)..Sarah ever hindered him and Brauch..’um....but I just want to meet Mehu..’,’Mehadi and no(all laugh) we can’t allow you in’,’and once again the day is saved thanks to BRAUCHY-MAN BRAUCHY-MAN(all brust into laughter)..’ so he ever flew off to all hells..and the little brat knew exactly what he was doing,always kept his insane bro in reservation area(all burst into laughter) with Luxary(all brust into laughter)..and knew every inch of the gym as if his very own place(all laugh) despite being there only once but had Gyarados(all laugh)..and tried to mingle with Vickie,Bix,Romu and Shane the most(all burst into laughter,Seth and Mehadi laughs lot,Mehadi in silence laughs a lot)..some pro that was(all laugh)..but yeah had his own mole in form form of Mr Ruben Eritak and Mr Wayne Mukhareb of all most infatuated brats(all laugh)..


and this all were during Battle
Frontier when we forced him to stay at visitors dormitory(all laugh) and had fun for 11 days then the
pest was angy and before we left the next day he set Dhelmise,Drifblim,Gourgeist,Banette and Sableye upon us(all laugh) who scared Viol to death(all laugh) but to he this meant greatest husband protecting
his wife(all laugh) so the whole world had to budge(all laugh) in Sinnoh was totally different patted us himself to stay healthy(all laugh) and all sorts of things that were irritating(all laugh) but we realized that he was a caring person very much but to me still was ego(all laugh)..and the only reason why he was caring to the whole world at Sinnoh was all cause poor little Dawwny was foisted the fullest care(all laugh a lot)..man just imagine a teenager with three absolute choiced brats who aren’t found before a few millenias in temporal scale(all laugh a lot)..no wonder she herself is like that like Groudon(all laugh a lot)..and man what a night discourse that was with subtler than words and infinity still involved another brat though as I said(all laugh)..thankfully Brock whom I’ve spoken of this time forgot his identity hence decided to record it(all laugh) and Viol was swinging each moment cause she was contacted 1000 times on Mantine(all laugh) and Lil couldn’t get over the Trophy(all laugh) that was fun..no Seth,for all,if you did regular the gym then,we would’ve had a serious problem cause your mad bro would’ve got too starved and attacked anyone(all laugh)...”
Seth(laugh) : “well I ever thought why only water gym why not water-DARK(all laugh) and the trophy was just my toffee-flower(all laugh)..but Daisy you should’ve kept Seismitoad atleast(all laugh)..Glalie was used may be twice cause of damn rules(all laugh) and may be 5th time turned on the whole gym as sustandard(all laugh) but,finally Professor,after too many melodies and too little fearows,sum up the 3rd stage of evolution.(all laugh).”
Gary(laugh) : “so the stricken boy and blossomed flower were forced out of teenage(all laugh) by the end of Johto 5 years year too late(all burst into laughter)...so thus were doing unteenage thinks in public places(all laugh) but now deep nights were better used(all laugh), without actual Gengars outside of sweet sweet hearts(all laughs and .s)...so yeah,to them the marriage was of 22 years and it was no big deal(all laugh) and so the results...” Seth(laugh) : “thanks for impersonal help Professor(all burst into laughter),the next stage is longing-boy and the once only Gyaradosy-flower (all burst into laughter) but sadly there’s a new pest of a rose in the horizon (all laugh),an unmarried sister brat(all burst into laughter),this has to be mentioned cause may be by now Drew has fled home(all laugh)...her bike also gets Thunder-chaird,’um..
Sorry May,but lets to to the shop directly and buy a bike’,’um..no let it go,my home is in next city lets go there rather bro..um..can I call you big- bro’,’um..yeah,sure,sis’ then we had an understanding since the first sight as well but this is the polite sweet unbiased May(Brock laughs),next moment comes out the extremely biased rosey one(all laughes),next day at Pettelsberg,then Max comes in,then we travel as soon as we start,’bro,do you have a girlfriend,have you proposed to her(all burst into laughter),what was the cost of the ring(all burst into laughter),get rid of that cap if you haven’t proposed your girlfriend (all burst into laughter)’...she was like yeah go and talk and all but dating etc where personal mingling comes like that absoluty devillish,either Drew has to directly propose or he’s not getting any sweet talks(all laugh)...and she as usual only Drew and that’s all and Drew had to directly propose to even befriend the Torchic(all laugh) don’t know how tiring the final was(all laugh)..proposal to her was the symbol of trust imbibed from cousins(all laugh)...anyway any other
boys if had any interest in her after Drew was around were it was my or Brock’s responsibility to drive them away in case they misbehave(all laugh) but she’ll play the sweet girl stuff (all laugh) cause Drew then will be beaten in his own game and that was their game-jealousy(all laugh)..sweet
girl stuff was after preliminary rounds(all laughs),my and Brock’s pokemons and philosophical knowledge (all laugh) or a huge lecture on what she expects from a certain person,which is her mom’s knowledge (all bursts into laughter) and of course her very own knowledge on gender bias(all burst into laughter)...that gender bias was her way to get rid of pests if they crossed the limit and we didn’t do anything about it (all laugh)...it was ferocious stuff cause used to read actually to get prepared (all burst into laughter) cause Drew had to get through that filter and I think that was a more dangerous filter to my namecalled ones(all laugh)..cause on very first date it’ll be show that your soul is eternally biased(all laughs)..yeah,this also included whether Drew can cook like Brock or not because of bias(all burst into laughter)..really little sis by all means(all smile)...they were after the Hoenn was soulmated in both ways and the full side-show frontier(all laugh) was negotiations on proposal and cost of that(all laugh) and if we retorted would make a face and like get tearfull that her brothers were genderly biased(all burst into laughter) and so on,no wonder Drew had to take her with him in Johto(all burst into laughter)...but our sweet crook decides to give this costly meance to confession rights(all burst into
laughter) her 3 and half year food(all laugh)...and yeah,she was the only travel companion to whom I myself mentioned my sweet-bug’s name(all laugh) others were told it was only me and Brock who travelled together(all laugh),so this sister-pest hears the name Mehadi and goes like wow,5 years how many proposals cost wise(all burst into laughter), whether you’ve proposed on mid dawn(all laugh) or mid afternoon (all laugh) and so on...I tell her look you’re just getting started, concentrate on Torchic(all laugh),that would become gender bias(all laugh) especially cause her ‘lil sweet bro never liked her attitude cause she was making deals at his cost(all laugh),this young bro was all over Brock(Brock laughs) cause he was the encyclopedia on any legendary pokemons and then later to my flower cause my flower was the ideal youngest sibling-flower(all burst into laughter)...anyhow just to end that this pester- sister was even more dangerous in after battle parties where she had to be allowed via her dad’s very high position,which by the way my flower used at Kanto but I desisted myself cause she was too bug- tempered then(all laughs)..and Pasio battle parties were all about holding each other’s hand(all laugh) and all,but Pasio was strangely calm cause I was interested in the history and all,the halls were old and beautiful and all and for my toffee-flower it was water pokemons so those were rather calm and holding the hands too too too firm(all laugh) and we were 18 so onlookers like jackals(all laugh)..didn’t get much chances and jackals never went to parties except the final one cause obviously those patries weren’t held in bushes(all burst into laughter)..the only thing cunningly best(all laugh)..anyhow so this sister-pest went with her big bro whereas the bigger crook wasn’t allowed as he had to babysit littlest bro(all laugh)..sister took the big bro so that sister could enjoy parties that wasn’t allowed before(all laugh) but mostly because dumped semi- grown male brats were always there(all laugh),so anyway sis would threaten bro that if any boy was asking her to dance he has to be Thunder-chaired(all laugh) though she’ll herself talk with all people in the world(laugh) this is a double-edged ploy to get her jealousy stories richer and get my sights off other girls(all . and laugh) and if I don’t listen then Cerulean Gym will be informed from the spot itself(all burst into laughter) with the fact that I wasbiased(all laugh) and this was way before when I didn’t formally confess(all laugh)...May obviously
knew quite a lot by the time she saw my flower first and the first thing she says after formalities ‘aw...heard so much about you,bro is so fond of you’(all burst into laughter) then was trying her hands at proposals(all laugh) which was somehow managed...but still the biggest trouble was the Crook(all laugh) cause crook joins us a bit later in Hoenn and first thing he says ‘yeah,Seth,Mehadi told to tell you this(all laugh),this is the confirmation of proposal (all laugh) so ‘aww,this is why so much talk,bro what’s her ring size’(all burst into laughter)...then I say ‘give it a rest, she’s my friend only’ this statement to the Crook is most heinous (all laugh) he later goes putting a wise hand on my shoulder and looking at the sky(all laugh) I still remember even after 17 long years, ‘Seth,all friend earthly, girlfriend heavenly’(all burst into laughter)... anyway,the Crook was worst at Sinnoh(Brock laughs)...but that much later,so crook you may finish cooking” Brock(laugh) : “right,so this was longing-boy(all laugh),before reunion it was general stuff,’hey Mehu,come here’(all laugh),but since he saw Gyarados with his flower it was outrageous stuff(all laugh)..but this is best explained by the Gyaradosy-flower”
Mehadi(laugh) : “right my Cerulean Gyarados(all laugh) as usual minutely observes me too closely (all laugh) cause it was 11 months too soon(all laugh) and he didn’t quite get my personality change(Seth and Mehadi laugh at each other)...this is a huge topic but I’ll say just a bit later,just the hint is that why wasn’t he informed during Unova when his phone was turned off perpetually(all laugh),anyway,so my beau observes me and sees the responsible(both laugh)..um,sorry but this was the exact gateway to my hellrounds(all laugh)...and also why Dase, Cerulean,the whole world was sweared left and right(all laugh)..so sees my new self,of course totally becomes a pet (all laugh) and starts Gyaradosing(all laugh),his knowledge on Gyarados actually saved Telplocus first cause he told me how to get a good hold on
the Gyarados rage(all laugh) which was simple,quote ‘migle her with Chu-bro and tell her to misbehave and try her hands at infighting(all burst into laughter)’..that’s how Tyrangaleo was tamed first(all laugh) all else jumped upon them in unison as was the case of Metagross(all laugh) but he is way more polite(all laugh) but then the real Tyranitar and Madgaleo came with the happiness instructor(all laugh)..no Seth did tell me jokingly before leaving and I realized later of course what it was I just laughed at first but when he gave me Chu and was very serious again told me ‘let Chu among your bunch in gym or here Gyarados,Dwegong,Kingdra,Sharpedo,Tentacruel etc needs to calm down and get more jovial realizing that Chu is just too powerfull and the only way to mitigate him is to play around with him giving him the signal that they don’t mean any harm cause by being serious they are making Chu to become even more dangerous cause you might be needed anywhere in the first 1 month only because I’ve told them that you’re my wife cause of the wills and all and send them copies of ourmarriage registry certificate so if these guys are serious like they are,consider yourself dead after you’ve just agreed to go.”(all smile)..um..do you want to know more about my bee’s final message cause like fearows may come around again and I never shared these and he won’t tell anyone except me these things seriously(smile)..?..” Gary(smile) : “as ever Mehadi,we know his bunch too well but not how he himself got here and especially me given I was better than him at a time however long ago and small spanned it was and yes given the situations fearows are dangerous and if not them others that aren’t pokemons are there too waiting patiently and then I myself have 30.” Daisy(smile) : “always Mehu,we remember the 16 year old Pokemon Master who had 3 pokemons and told us that(Seth laughs and shakes his head) and barring the obvious,what 2 amongst them do now with one not even being the original one(Seth laughs shaking his head) and well he entered our gym with two pokemons that day still and his starter still wasn’t in terms with him and still the other miffed Lil up enough no matter cause she had 3 years experience no matter(Seth laughs rest smiles) and yeah I guess we’ll need to know cause things aren’t good and we don’t want to hinder his bunch or even Magmorter and Golem cause we don’t understand their actions in normal situations wholly many times as thhey are ever too playfull..” Mehadi(smile, oy very firmly,Seth smiles and tenders her head) : “thanks Dase,Gary.I’ve always kept it down as he also wrote it down in excerpts and then recorded it while saying just like that note cause it was too huge.I wrote the full thing down the..(takes a paper,Seth laughs and shakes his head,all smile) ‘Goldy is of your own nature ever playfull and innocent and that’s exactly how he came to you almost by himself.the skills you have are an illusion if you believe you’ve earned them by training.this might be my final long talk Mehu,just saying unless Mr Daquan at (),Unova wasn’t thrown to this horribly fate intentionally not by accident,I would never have been remotely bothered to leave you and it’s just because of him cause he showed me first to the way to this condition of mine that is now and my bunch and in a way he was my gateway to my soulmate as well..I can’t let him down while he gets back to normalcy..his story comes later in this talk.he you know best general dragon gym 156 highest trained dragons including all,the greatest gym leader in 500 years may be in Unovan history and the similarly glorious man as a person,I met him during Unova Elite4 as well just discussions just visited his gym,he was single and lived rather a pious and saintly life this profession is just his love for pokemons and is a man of real high order by all means that man had to face 4 buffoons out of blue already has sanctified those 4 brats unless they have had the chance to meet him face to face before and learn about honesty from him which may help them in rehabilitation after they are caught by their own legendary brats and due to them all of those 156 dragons totally wiped and he was psychiced off by 70 most elusive legends whose masters I’ll be so overjoyed to meet to see what is better greed or joviality,anyway Mr Daquan was sent to hospital nothing could be done as the brats went there with 20 fire legends out of blue in late night but all these you’ll learn now as you read anyway,I’ll say much today with repeations may by but anyway,lets continue,see Mehu it’s a huge story and I won’t may be ever have time to tell you or anyone else in full but just the hint is that,as long as I’m concerned,my level wouldn’t have been achieved if I didn’t become so cruel on everything and everyone in personal life,my full nature had to be superimposed upon my bunch without any hindrence and this is the whole reason I didn’t marry you after Sinnoh though I so much wanted,my bunch needed me more than you did then and I realized it what I did later is my fault ever being not beside my friends in their most crucial time but going to Unova then isn’t and becoming so cruel later too isn’t cause everyone knows the reasons and what my fault was was what I was trying to get away from at that time in the absolute wrong way and that’s my ego that I’m honest no matter what I do just this idea not the actual thing were.I told Trace this once in a negetive way but it’s true once I made myself believe that I’m that illusive ‘THE HONEST MAN’..it’s an illusion cause if you are really that you don’t need to announce that to yourself and now you understand everybody is that but don’t need to try to make themselves believe in that but the path is something unimaginably difficult than words and it’s not absolute I’ve travelled only a small way as you and anyone else has but hence my experience matters which is unique and not repeatable at all cause of luck and chance and finally all you can do is to try to be yourself as the reasult won’t matter cause as I said it’s useless to believe that I’m going to get that result cause it’ll fall one day if not oiled,you the soul will never cause that is the oil and thus it’s polluted if rubbed the wrong way of beliefs appearing in illusions self created.I don’t have any idea myself what I’m talking about cause I’mnot enlightend like the great saints who told these cause I’m only walking their paths just started and not finished and this road doens’t end but neither is it that they are absolutely all true because of who said it cause as well they are not me and viseversa but that’s the whole point of battling as well win loss draw doesn’t matter the joy only matters and of general life as well.so I’m walking the path as much I can to understand things about myself more and more cause of who I am and I can’t express it as you know it’s self realization but that too is different to everyone and if a degree of joy is enough for you you’ll never compare it with another cause it’s pointless then and that’s the central part of my bunch and style and all.I have to know who I am and then stay with that idea as much as possible without any actions outside to make myself believe in it just carrying out the day to day life and all and if I can stay with it day to day life is automatically fixed as from me only my actions,except the physical and mental natural ones,has come into exsistence and not the other way around as when I was in my mom’s womb I had no idea what is what but I was and so that’s the thing that it’s about interaction and not trying anything the joy extracted from the interaction is maximized if we stay with ourselves and nothing else and thus you also know the idea of soulmate,if projected out,you can’t stay alone at all and hence my endeavors only.Mehu,I totally deleted you off and Mehadi Waterflower became cough and spit to me until I realized the other way around that day and that’s why I wasn’t happy when I didn’t have you,15 or 23500 would never matter if you weren’t my soulmate,I would’ve never returned and also if I didn’t have the realization still because of that cough and spit idea being imbibed illusively and wouldn’t have returned had you or me died.I was desperate to test who is who and what is what and I didn’t care I fig where I’ll end up but as the reality is,I WILL end up to you and the viseversa.my words are from books thus seems abstruce but anyone may try it they will get it their way,not mine.I was what I was after my break up and intuitively I knew I’ll either get everyone back or if not,then I will atleast have my bunch with me no matter of my human self and lunacy if I tried to be a Gengar cause that they were my soulmates was clear to me before you but it was sudden and thus I’m just lucky to have it and I truly can’t describe or specify to you what I know cause I have no words for how I look at pokemons cause they are exactly human to me with some restrictions and this idea will not leave me beyond death and hence my career has come to and end and I’m running everywhere to share it and tell people to not be greedy cause they are you and you’re harming yourself and this is harming my personal life which is dreadfull cause you are the same and I’m leaving you but I can’t tell them no now,that’s dishonesty to my bunch cause I got them prepared for what they want all time that’s fun of adventure and making new friends that’s exactly why I’m going out but won’t anymore cause I won’t promise them again cause exactly that promise is my ego but this they won’t realize and those creating the mess won’t only I will and I’ll get the consequences.anyway let’s cometo grosser terms,If I married you after Sinnoh I would’ve been great personally and all but at the cost of my bunch who would’ve followed suit gleefully cause they themselves don’t know and that’s exactly the reason why I’m the master and they’re my followers in this term of life no matter what it is in reality.I must serve my role that I’ve chose before coming here and that’s the thing.if I ran back to you during Unova I would’ve been a great friend and THAT HONEST MAN,you so much cherished-yes that’s exactly what was Seth to you then not this Seth that you know as you now,but that honest man was my ego which I cut off in front of you and your ego of responsible big sister as well as you know.my ego of making myself beileve that I’m honest no matter what I do as I don’t mean any harm was hindering my bunch cause they weren’t getting my intentions and was misbehaving as they never knew what and where they were mentally only having the faith that I myself atleast won’t harm them.your pokemons will listen to you cause they think you’re just them and that’s why they battle for you,they need this light to tell them who they are and then only they do things thus you see no matter what you do all you can only do is to become youself which will be reflected in them if you’re fontunate enough to have them even in singularity thus Mime is exactly like us but a different temperament cause mom has her and she is mom’s refection in terms of subtle nature which again I can’t explain injust realize and thus I’ve no match in pokemon world profession because I get them as if I’m exactly a pokemon and the viseversa and thus their intelligence though we know in reality we’re different but only due to our appearing existences to each other.another with more playfullness than me is my friend and we can’t be compared by any means gross or subtle as you see we’re very happy to be just ourselves and the moment we seeeach other we’ll forever hug it and joke it out exactly like you and me but not so strong cause we’re soulmates they are not upto that level but friends truly and that’s why in this term of life,this family and my sis is important to me in different degrees and that’s why they’ve come back like they have despite facing my most cruelty which they did only because we’re so attached.and that’s exactly why my bunch can fondle that I can’t cause they belive I can and I only know that I’ll have to die even if scared to be beside them if death comes cause if I don’t I’ll not be honest at all and an idea then will grasp me that you said you’re an honest man,but see you’re not it’s an ego still but the thing is that I despite knowing that I lost my soulmate and didn’t do anything will make me die and go to them-yes such is why this is what it is,just can’t be separated no matter who tries their hands at the other way around themselves.if that day comes they’ll fondle death like Feraligator and Crawdaunt did but all I can do is to die with this idea that I’m not going alone
atleast another two is there and this they exactly know or believe in hence their power they thing they know my human existence as well as I do so do things that they do which I don’t understand at all my brothers here do cause they know anout genetics and all.I can only try to stay as myself and they’ll see me and do what they do and I’ll try to guide them to be themselves and try to be themselves and they myself its’s exactly the relation of soul and if in one moment you don’t have it,just jump if they need you cause the end is inevitable that if you don’t still the same so why be afraid-this exact fear isn’t a fear that a soldier conquers or a man whose family is being attacked my pokemons but more subtle cause in all above there’s a reason to do so and that’s not here cause you’re alone as pokmeons aren’t you and viseversa no matter what you say and think and are.they will never be me and viseversa and soul doesn’t die so I’m ever alone but ever full if only I know who I really am and stay with it.I left you and went to undercover then Kalos all for my bunch and Elite4 was myself,I realized this interaction intuitively and could also guess that they needed me first in Unova but then my honesty mask was disturbing me as I was subjected to public glare cause and I was trying believe that I’m honest and so went full on about it cause in my mind I was ever with Mehu here and never left home and still the same that I was just after I went out of my home to get my starter pokemon.after that incident in public the spitting one,I was confused that if for even one moment in that short space of time I gave in to my emotions and forgot who I was,forgot you were there,forgot everything and gave in to the emotion then my honesty mask told me,go full on with it,yes,exactly infidelity cause you’re honest aren’t you,even if you cheat you know it’s just about nothing and Mehu is there,why bother,cheat just don’t do THAT and don’t get vulgar and that’s all,kiss people around hug people around stare people around just don’t do THAT,that’s all cause doesn’t matter just the moment cause you know ACTUALLY its’s ONLY Mehu.enjoy yourself you’re HONEST about YOU aren’t you that it’s ONLY .? This will eventually mean you’re a pokmeon in a herd and thus the stuff.then I was asked in my mind that this honesty mask is saying so but what is this honesty,all depends on what you were taught and handed down so this mask can get away with cause you can marry 100 and divorce 100 then another and also kill 100 hug 100 then kill the next pokemon and human so all that you know values and all all just emotional mental stuffs dependent only on conditioned so this mask is here cause there is a thing called honesty which is that I want one but you know it’s useless cause you know about body and all so what is this all about...these ideas were pouring down on me and was creating a mess cause I didn’t know anything about anything..the world as I know was just totally upended and I had to ask myself what is and idea what is gallantry things like that cause all were emotinons and luck and dependency and that’s all and now I’m much more clear but then there just flooded me off cause I was in a circle that to be honest is to not be dishonest to be which you have to be honest somewhere before and so a cycle never ending unless you give up the whole notion and now as I do just spit and cough the end I’ll be who I’m that’s it and if this is throughly ingrained you can’t do a harm cause you’ll not find any reason to do good to begin with what to speak of the opposite..just like bunch all you’d want is to play around like a 5 year old totally careless about everything and the joy is just from inside just enough to forget the surrounding but then these weren’t clear and I was all over the place and infidelity was why I didn’t want to talk with you then cause I wasn’t sure whether that moment I gave in or din’t and this idea made me turn on everything and my confusion my bunch caught as they in general catches your emotion and they never knew what they were where they werementally nothing..so I decided the only way to test my honesty and get off from the mask is to to the press and all and yet if somebody wanted to be personal with me then just mercilessly prey upon them cause I wanted the millions at my door to chew them off so prove to myself that I was honest and not make me believe that doesn’t matter I am honest cause my soul was telling me that dishonesty makes no sense at all cause if honesty like this creats this mess and hurt so will the other way around so it makes no sense and thus you should’nt be bothered about people and relations at all don’t give a damn about them play around like a kid totally careless,I was out to stay with the idea that I’m honest and no matter what happens outside I’ll stay as honest rather before when I was doing things and got results and thought or believed that I was honest...so first thing Cilan you know chides me cause his ‘mam has made a mistake selecting me,I lost it at that moment cause that was infidelity to me which I was fighting against,that was the only time I really wanted to kill the whole world off immediately cause for all along I was hearing newes about you Cilan was ever at my ears all of you here the same and you I could sense was losing faith from upon me slowly and all and now I had this illusion myself and this guy is making it worse cause I can see how infatuated he is with this idea of young flower dream no matter ho truly respectful way and now getting personal with me..I lost it just then and this devil that saves me cause it’s my soul thus the dark psychic fairy..told me chew this guy upon mercilessly and show him what is infatuation and where it stands againt honesty if you’re really honest that is show him what honesty actually is,so told him him he wants to know about mistakes,come to the next gym that was dragon type,(),in Unova whole world knows it...I told the leader 3 on 3 absolute full force you come at me and they knew my name and all so I said I want to test myself to the absolute fullest possible against a true legend like you and your bunch,Mr Daquan,that is anyway,he goes in with his best 3-> first his very best a mega evoluted Garchomp,then Zekrom,finally the mega Latios,a mega-max-Garchomp took 2 minutes 10 seconds,mega-max-Zekrom took 2 minutes 52 seconds,mega-max-Latios took 4 minutes 43 seconds cause she was trying to play as that’s her nature so took a bit more cause Chu had to irritate her first to cajole her into best moves..yes,Chu did it to Latios and Mantine did it do Zekrom of all pokemons and Mantine’s level of thunder chair was equal to Zekrom just the questions and mind games and cool water nature and the time to hold on the thunder chair did it for him and then Garchomp got Togedemaru again similar to Mantine and only Chu had the electric on fly advantage I did tell him the order even that day I said I just want to go full throttle and he is who he is realized the only way to have his way against Chu is to fool around totally exactly what Chu now wants or Mantine or Togedemaru but his Latios was battle hardened so couldn’t continue it,Mr Daquan will surely return in 5 years to be the next jovial pokemon trainer I sure want to see in my lifetime another who would do this and do this after his first journey itself as well he or anyone just best wishes and anyway,then there the best pseudo-legendary dragons in Unova in the most famous gym all straight sent to pokemon centre cause they were severely injured and it took 2 thunder-chair each for first,one for last and that was really even made Mr Daquan a bit concerned as to how long it will take to recover and Chu he realized was angry cause Latios was funny but he was expecting way more which he didn’t get so hit his friend a bit harder but the girl was alright..I ask him if he thinks I was trying to kill his bunch,smiles puts his arms on my shoulders and says,‘my Zekrom is electric dragon,supposed to just laugh-off a Mantine and you should know mine did use his best thunder-chair cause that’s what I meant,and you saw the self heal of Togedemaru who isn’t even a full electric and she can laugh off 10 such Garchomps in 2 minutes 10 seconds if she wants to cause her thunder chair can persist for like 40 minutes,Seth,whole world knows what your bunch does and so do I but still I will say knowing is one and seeing another and I’ve never seen anything like this and can think so easily,those whoever told you you’re trying to kill off opponents should ban any electric type pure or mixed totally banned forever cause they by accusing you and Togedemaru,Mantine and Pikachu are hindering this legendary thunder-chair and stopping the growth.I’m 56,I’ve been in this since 22 and you must’ve heard about me,just go on lad,don’t pay any heed to anyone,atleast you’ll have my support till end and till you’re legal,and I say legal cause just don’t get dissapointed if you don’t find any challengers,just tell them my bunch is too strong for battling and they’ll just give you a comfortable seat in a great position,just be with your bunch and enjoy life that’s all don’t get into illegal business that’s my only wish cause we won’t see you and your bunch many times in next some number of years.I know what honesty has a tifle electric type Togedemaru to today thrash may be the world’s best dragon gym’s best pokemon a ground type mega-max-Garchomp in 2 minutes and 10 seconds and he was at full health and they were my best 3 and all went to absolute full.if you were dishonest you wouldn’t have survived Garchomp’s first proto charge what to speak of this.finally I haven’t spoken this long in years to challengers,but Seth,just my best wishes for you,ever will remember you,best wishes,here’s your badge but it should be you giving me cause I’ve been totally defeated in battle,but just seen you and your starter Pikachu,that’ll be enough for this life to remember that I’ve seen an once ever legend so humble still to ask me if the most basic question of a novice but who has all respect and the most most common but self dignified man,’am I not being honest’,just best wishes and yeah I know as do the whole profession about your questionsing methods and what your and your pets say via the translator from your lab surely that being a special one had some inputs from their only current trainer-customer and yeah your unconfinement of being is what I surely have been trying to follow as much as I can in my personal life too since I came to realize the joy of it and you may know about that part of me as well again just best wishes so happy am I today to see you lad really just so happy’..hugged me for a moment I smiled and said thanks I’m just so lucky to be able to meet you too and yeah I know about you in as much detail as I could get from my reliable sources and my travel compnaion is Clian Green you may know him he is may be the best budding dragon specialist breeder in whole Unova I got him after I told Elite4 here about my and my bunch’s condition so they provided the best possible travel companion who knows the whole region so very well his 3rd trip and knows about you too well heard about you a lot and hence wanted to come to meet a person of such hig order like you so much and you’ll always remain a gym leader who kindly thought that I was worthy of the badge despite of me then he just smiled and we hugged again went off..Cilan didn’t obviously see this just the fight and then he is a breeder with great skills so I asked him,and he checked the dragons Latios was extremely injured but not fatal and Garchomp was middle Zekrom was least injired..a ground,a electric, a physhic Dragon types of all and best evoluted in best gym in the world,evaporized in 11 minuted the leader who himself his a true legend in every aspect of life says you’re a legend not a criminal,Mehu,that made me realize I can’t harm pokemons atleast,I also showed my Lati and Zekrom to him they were respectively 5 and 2 months old with me and that was my 187th gym as you know he saw my brats and said yeah something special by all means Lati just started her madness of battle starvation he said not stopping till whatever she understands of your pshilosophical training by the self out of being is getting achieved and that’s exactly what has happened she can go a step more than Ghostradarkarrigussonor and still Cozy can go one more atmost though psychic types you know it’s just ever prediction you can’t rank friendship that is between siblings or spouses anyway then I travelled myself got Garchomp then you know went to Huntelion and so on and so I then knew atleast to pokemons I wasn’t being promiscuous with but this idea of cheating on you gripped me that I wasn’t sure whether if I looked at a person of the opposite gender whether I was adoring her physical beauty or mental qualities or behaviours with me or not and thus I didn’t know who you are either as I thought may be you’re the same like all just my 15 year infatutaion and mistake..so I found no meaning in the idea infidelity is all was just for physical purpose and you gave in at anytime mentally even thinking that somene is cute...this was the greatest trap that had opened,the illusion says,’honest with pokemons,you’re then a pokemon,but you’re human,so you should behave like a pokemon means you that promiscuity to full degree’..and I totally lost it..I thought well I’ll see what is what,and the only way is to detach yourself from everything to know who I really was and just be with pokemons cause they knew who I was if I didn’t properly but I still intuitively know pokemons and not a bit about humans,but I’m a human so I should know and go to the end to see..I knew I can’t be a monk or something or like Sabrina,I never felt that way and much later realized you were the reason cause we can’t stay away cause we’ve been born in 2 different bodies but then it was an intuition only and no I still will get charmed by sudden appearnece of so and so but at Unova it might’ve been 1 minutes now may be 30 seconds but still better and thus I thought I must make a deal and came back for the last try to rescue my relationship with all but I told myself I will always defend myself and never say sorry cause as a friend and the honest Seth Ketchum I made a Mehuake yes,as a soul I didn’t cause till my last my bunch needed it and no matter what I had the right to do what I felt from soulthe best and if that takes me to be alone,I will be alone but this soul I have to find else I’m nothing but a pokemon and thus can go all about it while still being honest..I needed to get rid of my mask of honesty..then the break-up then undercover where I still didn’t know and all those stunts were happening to me but I could see that I was inherently honest and couldn’t think of dishonesty despite having all chances and thus my bunch became what they are cause they wanted me to go toe to toe with them and there I never let myself slip so they were there at there fullest became independent of me totally and they can manage other pokemons infact they can catch wild herds tame them use them in battles beat a human challenger all without me I only have to look after them the emotional support and you know best what is needed top be done the suppliments etc they are that much independent to me cause they are my siblings or more like soulmates I will still be connected to them if they are here,I’m at Unova still in a way I can’t tell you not plausible to think but I know I will and they know they will too anyway then went to Kalos studied and learnt then that same incident when happened by then I knew what I was and statred to go at anyone cause by then I was what I was,I was happy and never cared for anyone at my core cause I didn’t depend upon anything material or abstruct for my happiness..then Elite4 and all along this idea and intuitive longing for you was there and never knew it so now I negeted the human world cause no more infidelity or generosity and so on could do anything cause I knew I’m not depened on a thing but just that emptiness was there which of course then was fulfilled as I got you but I saw you were left all alone and was waiting for the sinister helpless for something..I still didn’t believe even till that day me met in the noon at the Lab that you really are me,Mehu.later you did tell me in the very beginning that how much you long for me but for you that was about still the honest Seth,not the real one..then finally when you had it,you were taken back and sealed in my soul,you’re not leaving me at all once again another time I got to know that Mehu is my soulmate.now look Mehu,the point is the whole process and all,you know finally we will meet but my and dad ware similar.my mom isn’t like me,so my skills are of no use it’s about how far you can push your bunch telling them they and you always interacting via soul-this idea as much as possible..they will do the rest all by themselves..but the trouble is they still may not be able to battle,look I’m a 6 league champion,undercover legend and Elite4 destroyer not for nothing,you know how I was from day one and how many innumerable battles I did and all,how well I know about this whole pokemon world..that is the more the better..to me as you know with my trouble gender and so on the differences must perish same with my pokemons and hence with my soulmates and actually as I told you I consider all my soulmates you just most dear one the culmination that’s all but for the same reason you surpass all by every means like the general pokemons and my own bunch you and they all just Mehu..Goldy is your best Pokemon currently but don’t think he can’t be surpassed by others like even your Corsola but the thing with Goldy is that he is exactly like your own nature but in fornt of me if he is imbibed with one hint of idea that his master wants to defeat the challenger,me,he will be laughed off again..I can’t be beaten I can only be made friends with in pofessional life.that’s the end of career as I realized it as told by Crawdauntogator the most against team rocket’s greatest boss and he did realize the same as did Lance and Mr Daquan,Mrs Lillie Jolum,pseudo-legend gym just like my own aunt ever so very own to me from Unova you may know whole world does and so on cause to me,that friendship but I always say Gengar I want to be a Gengar to you like how I behave with Trace say for example I can’t help but swear his head off cause the love I have for him can’t be politely or formally expressed same with Brock and Gary you know he the same never separate and so on and this I do with Drew and then Tony and Cilan and all and this is to me is ultimate as to them the same only thus does it happen Cili didn’t realize it then at Unova later did and same for me both did realize it and then you know May and now Dave you do and will as well in coming decades and so on and yeah same with all your sisters as well Violet for sure I know her very well as does she talked so many times as you know and Daisy and Lillie too hence I could do whatever I did to them never thought they won’t understand me if I’m honest same with everyone and no they only proved me wrong cause I never needed to to it to them to begin with they are just like Trace as well just my big sisters as well.Finally,you own nature helps you all the time especially against lunatics who wants their pokemons to kill everyone or against cruel geniouses like the greatest boss of whom you’ll want to face the boss everyday cause you can affect him ifyou’re honest and get upto him but not the first kind against whom you have to be cautious at the same time being playfull cause the caution is of your own physical safety.I need that if these pests are like that..in my experience,no legend will ever be tamed via power but always by laughter..I faced one as you know he would’ve smoked both me and Muk in history in less than half a second with his Physchic charge alone if we had anything else except frinedship and fun in our mind which we didn’t and it made Riumina totally dumbfounded and later just became so happy to be a friend and that was the time I was most agitated personally cause I knew who my soulmate was but had to make her realize that and really test that but even before check my own idea again..still I never wanted to do anything except fun and so the legend became my and Muk’s friend then I took him to a centre cause he was extremely abused they cured him within a week or so flew off..look I did this much still won’t come with me cause he is ever free,he will come only to be my friend my family my soulmate and then only I can tame him,tame,catch anything means befriend,that’s what it’s all about.No,none should try to copy me cause they can’t as I can’t copy them,they’ll become full lunatic if they try their hands at this cause I myself was at the verge of lunacy and eventual death becoming a Gengar in human form and no I wanted it I still would’ve died happily they are my own but still I wasn’t copying anyone so I would’ve never had any reservations which others may have hence will be under trouble and no I ever say how a Sandslash I met at Kalos is a great philosopher who scoffed at me saying you failed at this paper supplimentary even how do you expect to get into research and it’s cause yeah I did let wild herds fondle my nerves as much as I thought I could take but still and I did it cause I I wanted to hear these from them in a way in my interpretations as you know we get these and that’s really is my joy working with them being them and then again I do all these intuitively ever and still don’t know what I’m doing cause the intuition is just that I want to free myself and them up from this confinement of being as I love to say and this I want cause some degree of truth is there I feel and just am running after that unlike Typhlosion who already has reached that but I’m just following his lead so only too happy that I’m at his lap and so all else should just try their way but they will reach this level of friendship even if that doesn’t reflect in pokemons skills,their pokemons too will be ever jovial but may not be like mine who can do anything against legends cause mine had been trained day after day that knowledge won’t go and that’s unique..but they don’t need to be my copy nor do I,this is a big world none is for none..if you’re happy because only of yourself,that’s it.if situations come in your way just tell them you mean no harm to others and you want to battle purely for fun and nothing else,though this is a hard idea as fun can get you in serious trouble as well cause any best battlers like Laura vs Katya is that and my Pikachu alone can decimate 20 combined of any type of them now may be even at one go in less than a minute...none can match mine in power and anything cause if they are not friends,they’ll be made and no matter how powerfull,Pikachu won’t kill anyone or any of my others unless I’m physically threatened and they are with me,then they will suicide as well cause they won’t be alive if they have killed another person or human unless I want them to as that’s the instruction.I have tested this and I’m happy till something really gets to my nerves but I don’t care for that at all cause I’ll try to be who I’m till my last moment...anyway,Mehu,as I said just make them calm and jovial and don’t do anything with Goldy at all...Chu will teach them how to be calm cause your whole gym pokemons takes him may be 20 seconds max to evaporate completely if he wants cause his level is Lightenthunstrom max- best -normal with infinitely more intelligence so they can’t tame him by angering him and thus can’t stop him bossing them thus the only way is to fool around with him is to do exactly why he’s threatening you,’be my friend and don’t cross me cause with this power you and I both will die,why waste your time when none of us or our masters really mean it and mine doesn’t for sure’...now if they don’t listen cause their master is lunatic Chu will start to fool around with them but upto the level he can counter with power he will take that option first or threaten to do so cause his nature is like that only when it’s out of his reach by power will he show his real nature of complete joviality.Riumina’s interpretation by Chu and Muk was just that he wants to play around and I was a very good master but he was too week and wanted to sleep but he will try to come back and meet me again cause he likes me and he also wanted to fondle me but just was exhausted...I just pat him a bit and he looked very happy then dozed off,instantly called all...let him go after treated all I learnt was that he was saying that he was very happy to know goodhuman beings cause he hadn’t seen any and he would tell others that there are good humans too..and did fondle a few people there to death with extreme psychic powers to halluciante them to death and then was trying to understand them more and the instruments but didn’t like the confinement and becasme a bit suspicious then was again happy when they let him go but they said incredible intelligence might’ve already learnt a lot about good humans to him and all stuffs but said very suspicious that cause he was abused for 6 years and 5 and half took taming cause Riumina later the highest boss said was too freedom loving but more available easily than Mexutu and more genial cause Mexutu is psychic/fight yet Team Rocket never managed one cause never got one alone so may be it’s the herd or just too intelligent to even gauge human actions of it is suspicious to them by certain signals...and Mehu,know for sure I’m going there with 235 legends myself who are if equal type is equal to infinitely many rarest legends themselves cause there’s no comparison in family or friendship...that is their level now and that’s why I know so much about legendary pokemons I’ve been doing this since my very first year at Sinnoh itself after may be 6/7 months there.But Mehu I again tell you Chu might be 4000 Raftosmorics BUT that power is only electric type the legendary psychic will make Chu trifle if he tries to battle one cause you know well psychic powers are neither manifested properly by a pokemon unless they want nor can it be scaled in a proper manner and mostly if two Raftosmorics charge at each other both may be destroyed what to speak of 4000 against 1 cause that 4000 is self destructive mood and that’s why legends are so rare and roams in such small groups and hardly uses any attacks except psychics...never try to challenge a legend no matter how powerfull you are cause the legend will die but will take you and your bunch with him in cosmic darkness as that’s where there real power is and that no electricity can tame or be effective..a Raftosmoric can’t be killed by any lower legends if another Raftosmoric they can only be psychiced ou and killed thus same by a higher legend who has more psychic powers and only then that legend himself will survive after he kills Raftosmoric by psychicing him out all these fights are of intelligence never power,they don’t show powers at all thus I say 4 is 1 Chu but I’m only estimating and predicting don’t know reality neither does Chu know it and I don’t know Chu’s biology myself as my bros do neither does Chu know mine like I do..this fight isn’t about power or stategy or friendship it’s about   and loving death..totally different ground,who appeases death it winner..my bunch no matter psychic or ghost,can’t win against a legend toe to toe no matter if they are 235 together against 1 Ghostradarkarrigussonor cause the fight will take place in cosmic darkness where you can’t differentiate anything thus you may never return back and this is exactly why I need to go cause others do not realize that it’s not a power game anymore cause they haven’t used the machines when they should’ve had and thus I need to babysit the legends back home cause all else will foolishly try to fight and go down self destructing and the whole region might be in a trouble if they charge at humans or the powers go out of hands.LEGENDARY FIGHTS ARE ABOUT INTELLIGENCE AND FOR US HONESTY CAUSE IN DARKNESS 1 OR 4000 ALL ARE SAME LIKE 1 GUN AND 4000 YOU HAVE YOU CAN’T USE 4000 AT THE SAME TIME BUT ONLY ONE SO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ON LEVEL GROUNDS IN A DUEL..IT’S ABOUT HONEST ALL AND ALL...AS YOU MAY HAVE TRAVELLED 10000 MILES FOR 10 YEARS IN DARK FOREST NIGHTSS,NEXT ONE STILL A NEW,STILL YOU HAVE TO BE ALERT,thus is legendary fights,MY BUNCH NEEDS THAT PATIENCE EVERYDAY AGAINST A LEGEND that is what is about power and all about legends...anyway,Chu’s temperament if with me is an issue but at human level interaction he is the best but try to change that temperemental nature of him cause he suits you more than me,that temperament is just that breaking sweat nature which is why all pesters him in my bunch just his obsession with the fact that I must be protected that with you won’t be there just that,he is too fond of me as his little bro and is ever overprotective of his little bro but to you it’s that he is your friend for life and together he will boss me around that’s what he picked up first day in you and never forgotten cause that relation you have with me is unique and he saw it for 5 long years day and night 24 hours and understands it as we were mere teenagers then our true feelings to each other manifested the most cause we never were polluted by words,forms and ideas then but much later then just knew each other and wanted to play around with each other along
with our pokemons which IS our real nature and thus you’ll remember there was never one thought of any difference was there between us that I’m a boy and you’re a girl,never and that’sexactly why we never could utter the word cherish cause we were far higher than any word could explain our relationship which to outsideres seemed strange until they got it themselves and again we have had to realize it further as well.anyway,Chu will become way less temperamental with you and that’s huge advantage cause of his powers and intelligence that you’ll see and playfullness too cause he knows every trick of each of my bunch and has his own cause he can improvise brilliantly if he wants as I saw atleast 55/60 different kinds of thunder-chairs itself all different class and he may have used 500 thunder-chairs by now,you’ll learn more about this as you read.so,Your bunch needs to learn to be calm and playfull as much as they can in case of emergency and Goldy will tell them who Chu really is as well as Starmie,Starew and rest who saw him for 5 years day and night if they have any confusion with Chu’s temperament.your Gyarados can’t beat a swellend up Politoad if properly swellened up what to speak of a lightrope- Ferdkojnap,the least strengthned water-lightrope-prohgomeric-dragon-loiver-sternet known,the last two to specify the legendary dragon part and the third to specify lightrope itself,and water again is legendary section which you know best and there are may be 10 known in total and a Suicune to a lightrope-Ferdkojnap is like a Magmorter in an Ocean and Suicune we were lucky to see but they have 5 categories and the highest being waternope breed may be 6 people alive has seen ever...and yes,they will have lightrope-Bernetur which is the 3rd strongest all abused and swellened up and charging at you..you must remain calm and try to befriend him cause no matter what he is,is not a human thus doesn’t know the idea killing only interpreting in his own cognition from his master to get more and more angry and go full blast eventually self destructing which if they understand the opposing party is friends will never do and that power may be if possible become jovial like my bunch and then with that he’ll try to fondle everyone,that’s a Pokemon for you,no matter what the master is doing..in these cases you’re there to befriend the pokemon first and formost and human we all know be polite and gentle to anyone then if he’s a brat he will do what he does don’t bother he will go either to hell or heaven once he realizes his pokemons are not going to listen to him ever again but that’s a different matter of a killer that’s our problems not any pokemon’s.Mehu,just to tell you,this world you know and those against like the greatest boss just no comparison what so ever,don’t take youself seriously and think of anything or anyone even your soulmate if you want to get the job done and your soulmate you know always you thus with you.get one emotion of seriousness forcefully and your dead along with your bunch,in undercover there’s no point of being serious cause you know you’ve hugged death already so it’s just about the time and the moment so why bother,this nature as much as you have your bunch will get it and will remain calm against a swelled up ashed-Suicune brigade chargeing at full force with all attacks possible including Psychic.you’ll die no more.just try to be playfull and calm cause the pokemons aren’t killing you their masteres are and if this idea you and your bunch can somwhow project that their master is trying to fight and yours befriend they will instantly get confused and then turn on their own masters to fondle them to death to tell him that all is fun and the more honesty you have the more the lunatic human against you will be calm.and Mehu,I must tell you this that this idea of befriending you have to go through more to realized by those things I’ve told and given you cause I tell you something as it has just occurred to my mind as I’m saying all these,Mehu,there’s a legend called Ghostradrakarrigusonor,it’s primary ghost but probably has every single possible types and I just prey to God that those idiots haven’t got their hands on this legend and hasn’t swellened it up to maximum though only 1 substance which itself like the legend is difficult to produce is ever known to swell it up and also they can’t evolve this legend illegally cause they don’t know anything about it..years ago one legend was week and all they tried to treat him but still he befooled everyone and went away that associetation gave them some clue and thus this substance to actually control him may be yet they don’t know almost anything about the anatomy and all and this substance is just to make it sedative a bit not a power enhancing one but this substance if proper the legend will himself try to get out of this intoxicated state more and more according to the master’s orders and will creat trouble and they will find that substance from heaven or hell anyway and this legend is the greatest and most powerfull ever known and you know my ghost types and you can realize what a Ghostradarkarrigussonor is really...why I tell this is say he’s against Gengar you know what Gengar is he’ll play beyond his death without any letting up in intensity and fun thus say the legend understands that Gengar only wants to play doesn’t want to battle now say the legend’slunatic master is also realized by the legend as an intruder so he’s taken care of BUT and this is why he is the highest legend ever known is that now he wants to play with all pokemons NOT humans THUS I’M STILL an intruder to him and he will want to remove me cause one his own master looks like me and his nervous communication is like me so am I and thus he has a trouble this any legendary types has but the trouble with very high ones and this one is highest is that now if you say I’m your friend and I want to play with you as well he will NEVER STILL believe you cause he DOES NOT see you JUST AS GENGAR..you to him MUST be EXACTLY your GENGAR.if you give him 1 signal that you’re any different to him no matter how best you care,he will send you on that very moment in cosmic darkness cause that’s an intruder to his life now and this trick will be played with Gengar cause he will be told by the legend that all is well but why are you connected with your master so much I also want to connect so that I can too play with him..he wants to use Gengar’s own chanell to test my intensions with his own intelligence and test it this channel sharing is very few can do but this one will do at his leasure the first thing and actually he is still thinking Gengar is infact fooling him just as we humans do in such circumstances cause NOT of Gengar BUT due to my connection with him.Gengar is just his channel to know me that’s all.if I ever have 1 intesion where I try to be not Gengar to Gengar,I’m done in that very moment..the legend in fact I tell you just like a 5 month baby wants to see who his mom is cause he is not on her lap but someone elses which lap is very good but he feels uncomfortable cause it’s not his mom..yeah that’s pokemon thought process but we suddenly see this great lenegend and thus get greedy..and a 5 month child will only realize that this new lap is as safe as his mom’s only when he gets that assurance which how he will get you never know same as pokemons thus through Gengar you must tell him in all honesty that I’m Gengar as well..depends exactly on who you are and how well you know who you are after a certain span Ghostradarkrrigusonor will realize it and will fondle you to death and may be most human beings to death as well but then will be cheated upon his trust again cause he won’t recognize deceit like we do once he has trusted someone...this span is all about seeing 2 Gengars and all about how much Gengar you are yourself and at that time can wholeheartedly deliver...at that moment your whole world is being Gengar and absolutely nothing else,no soulmate,no death,no life,no friends,NOTHING...if you do well great but if you fail your Gengar will still be saved but he will be extremely dissapointed that his master cheated him cause now the legend will say you lied your master isn’t a Gengar to you just like my master cheated on me...everyone is a friend to their pokemon Mehu,but not their pokemons themselves means just this idea of being a pokemon as much is imbibed in your blood the better you are but again a lot more is needed cause you’re facing death and wanting to be a Gengar...far more than a soldier needs in a battlefield..it’s about just who you are and how satisfied your life is..one thought in that say absolute maximum 1.25 minute span and no it won’t be more than that but that span if not properly handled then you’re done your Gengar will turn on the whole world as well...you can tame any legend by friendship if they are naturally harmed and can’t go back home in an island like we tried to do to that Mexu in (),Johto but you NEVER will be able to just like that befriend an abused legend suddenly out of his intoxication cause now he’ll be doubting the whole world as the baby doesn’t know who mommy is no matter what and how tenderly others say he’ll test and never blindly on faith believe it..you know a 5 month old anyone can tackle for 5 minutes but not 30 and you need to give him that trust in 5 to make it 30 exactly what the legend wants HE WANTS HIS MOM NOT HIS FRIEND..simple this...just like I wanted my soulmate Mehu and not the illusion Mehadi...hard these are but just telling you as they come and you realize the practise isn’t at battlefrield or even your own bunch it’s to yourself and hence my confusion in Unova and subsequent haunting in Kalos libraries and talking to people going in universities where to them I was a Ghostradarkarrigussonor...this is the model as much as I’ve followed 20 minutes with my bunch instantly picked it up and themselves heightened their powers and playfullness cause all they want is that light that this is me lets be in delight,that’s pokemons for you too.But this all is a model as I tell you so many times that there’s no assurance in it,I just tried to say what I have in thoughts and ideas very little and insignificant is this and finally it applies to me only which is the most important thing to understand.I just said cause I was asked in my mind that’s all.about legendaries and what they do Trace,Gary,Brock and all will say infinitely more which you absolutely must digest as much as you can otherwise you will not beable to maintain that span I talked about and rush as new kinds of legendary psychics will pour down upon you and you will think I’m done lets go either to death or the legend himself will feign that he is tamed and you’ll think I’m done but as you let up you’re done truly.yeah,that’s why he is the highest legend.so mostly you will have to be on the spot and thus in the end it’s all about you even if you don’t have any prior knowledge just like I wouldn’t have if I faced a darkened-Mexutu during undercover but I’m sure myself that she or their Ulisasus would have been on my side once they knew my two water buddies but before that if I faced Mexutu and Ulisasus together at the same time,I would’ve been there against them like this may be 3 seconds but wouldn’t have been here today that I know also for sure..just forget this idea as much as you can that you’re something different to them and your effort will manifest.this will though be Mehu not Seth and thus the characteristics will be different in your bunch and may be they’ll be way more caring and all like you are and not so playful,to you they are ever your best friends but your nature is just like all of your sisters more or less that all of you want to play around and enjoy yourselves,pokemons are just a means of your soul to express the joy that you’re having being here like they reflect your own dreams in which you’re playing with most dear little toys who reciprocates and this joy that you have you want to share with a very special person after your parents,this person is your soulmate and hence this is what it is...and this also is why I hate the word DESTINY because it’s not suitable here,you’re nature is more your soulmate a little less on pokemons thus you’ve been able to battle more throughly than Daisy who is rather in equilibrium and thus hasn’t been able to battle for long...now that I’m saying I should say my interpretations for the family as well cause you never know which ghost you have to face but that’s trivial all I want is to make the road easier in case of interest cause it took me 5 years through many beautiful situations...I will speak about my self the last but to tell you this and thus may be also to make sure when you will know that I’m no more here with our future still only a possibility till now not a concrete stuff and you know you’re fine but I’ve had to do rather than happily reciprocating to do cause you know well that I wasn’t prepared for this at all after getting you back 5 years later I needed to settle myself down for a few months but again just wordplay doesn’t matter I only can see him or her on your lap so,basically if that somehow doesn’t happen and you don’t get the life that my mom has had then there will be trouble for you and this time it will be hard cause now we’re family and they will try to protect you by all means but you yourself will again try to shut yourself in the gym and resorting to techniques now so that I with our future is ever present and you’ll want to die sooner to join us which is a mistake cause you don’t know what happens after death or even just that moment before when you’re all alone and the whole life is infront of you demanding justification of your soul so that you will transmigrate happier or less so...both you and me can’t stay single cause of our realtion there and age here and if one goes so abruptly the other will unknowingly suffer...anyway,thus again for your idea and all,I spoke about Daisy as much as it seemed to me in my capasity and knowledge but I know Trace much better as you realize and he is exactly similar to Daisy just a bit here and there to fit the two sides in the right way as all of us know ourselves of their natures as much as it appears to us..Brock you know ever too caring and thus needs someone to reciprocate that as in soulmate and Violet ever too much a little kid who wants to give similar attention to everything thus ever longing for someone like Brock who will ever take care of her and all while she plays around be it pokemons or others thus the relationship..Gary we all know just ever wanting the emotional side to be taken care of and again the soulmate idea cause without that he’s not full and that’s only too visible in his case and Lillie’s case is the opposite,she needs the not-emotional side to be sorted out as Lillie is as you know,ever wants to fondle everything and thus Gary is there to keep he in check cause suddenly she has to deal with this mess called ideas,bodies,forms-the world...thus they need each other and thus the unit as a whole....anyway,my nature is that I want to become everything and see things through their eyes exactly as they do and hence my pokmeons are too playful whole time cause that’s thair ultimate nature well any living being’s ultimate nature is exactly that human or not that’s the stuff..and they are gettig my support so going full about it and for me that is exactly what I was doing I fell upon everything and everyone mercilessly cause what I didn’t have and that’s the part of me to keep me grounded is that I want to become exactly everyone thus I myself won’t have any separate existence thus simply evaporating in thin air and that you see isn’t possible cause as I told you,no matter what once you have the human form you’ll have a different nature so I can do whateverwhen I’m a soul and not a human as you and all else can cause then what is is not describable but which you will be able to describe the differece from you is the whole point of appearance of many on one as in soulmate it’s two thus to keep me here as myself and to make sure that I don’t obtrude others like my bunch etc in difference to be exactly like them no matter how much that is good for them but I’ll still be different in this life so to stay here alive and sane I need someone who will be with me beyond all deaths and will have unfathomable longing for me exactly what you represent and for you I’m there cause you will want someone to be with you while you fool around and try to boss everyone around like a little 5 year old child does and what you ever become to the whole world when I’m with you and you will never be able to be yourself here now cause you want everything to be different from you so that you can play with them YET have unfathomable longing for a PARTICULAR ONE who is exactly you yet different and hence I’m here cause of my nature...Mehu,we met that day in Yellowburst-DESTINY,we’ve all become a family like this-DESTINY,my bunch is like they are-DESTINY,I’m saying all these lines written in books and I got to know them and hear lectures on them and so on-DESTINY...even the fact that I’m married to you-DESTINY..yeah by chance no more as I said it can happen that we’re married to someone else....say you never existed in this world but I did and thus got married and all I would’ve had troubles then surely,but if I stayed SINGLE then,then I would’ve had no troubles at all cause you weren’t here and thus ever with me or I would’ve never even knew it or tried to know it cause I didn’t need it at all since childhood...but always situations don’t suit that and the biggest thing is the ILLUSION that created the difference between you and me to begin with,that’ll play around cause that’s part of human birth...but thus what is NOT destiny is our relation in between...IF WE ARE HERE TOGETHER AND OF THE AGE FOR LIKE WE CAN GET MARRIED AND ALL,WE WILL NEVER BE HAPPY UNLESS THAT HAPPENS...and exactly why people are not happy in so many such cases,it’s also DESTINY that you’re 20,I’m 60...no chance of marriage and all even if we meet BUT still we’ll not be happy at all if we’ve taken human birth at the same time except for the paternal or maternal relationship...now siblings are like limbs of the body born as your playmates but never the full body as you realize the same thing thet siblings don’t have the relationship among each other like parents and all that no matter the age...the full body will ever be your soulmate only in that relation and perents and own children are another completely different matter...so this is a chance that we’re in this like this but the realtionship is ETERNAL and thus imperishable...now lets come back to gross matters once more...with illusive legends like Ghostradarkarrigussonors you’ll neeed to strenghten yourself most cause you’re defence will be Butterfree and no more..you will not have another swellened up Ghostradarkarrigussonor as a defence so that you can jump on anyone and even if there you do you know the end result two worlds collide both having human beings living on them...so to get the job done and actually to manifest you heart and help the poor legend in plight you must be there BUT with as much preparation as you do cause they will connect you via your Butterfree and send innumerable psychic waves may be all unknown to disturb you enough to find faultlines in your relationship with Butterfree for that 2 minute span..and you’re human,thus all I said will haunt you exactly then as your mind is disturbed and Mehu,this human body and mind is dangerous as I told you it needs oiling of all sorts..so no matter who you are and how happy with your soulmate and all,you WILL forget everything at that moment cause you’ll be facing DEATH the ever unknown...unless your ideas are oiled you will be able to face it in a battlefield and all but NEVER if you’re being mentally tortured to death like a very bad prototype that I showed you when I gave you my 5 years in 6.5 hours,Mehu you know very best that I’ll not leave you no matter where you go being your soulmate thus you were phisically safe that day even if in general I’m not a murderer and you know that it was not a torture at all I was trying to tell you what you are to me in that language just to try to break your illusion.BUT that moment against a legend you’ll have absolutely ZERO help ouside that I provided you,you’ll not be facing your soulmate but an unknown enemy no matter if he is just a 5 month old baby inside and you will get every bit of psychic tourture to actually kill you and not to tell you that you’re my soulmate please understand that and be with me again...the legend has got nothing to do with your human emotions he wants to be sure that he’s Butterfree to you the same thing my bunch wants all time that say Feraligator wants me to be him all the time and I as my nature only too happily be so..thus he is getting the support and thus I say they are my soul cause they see me exactly like that...yes here as well,they are my soul and sees me like that but they are not humans so they are not may soulmate at all...those who can’t breed not due to natural condition like Snorlax,Muk,Mime,Mismagius,Whimsicott,Torterra,Beeheeyem,Dialga,Solgaleo,Glalie,Gourgeist and so on but can’t breed because they’ve heigtened their powers to be with me all the time like Feraligator,Bulbasaur,Greninja,Noivern,Darkrai,Palkia,Sableye,Zekrom,Krookodile,Tyranitar,Mars hadow,Garchomp,Gengar,Confragigus,Lunala,Crawdaunt and so on especially almost all who came to me or was caught in Unova and Kalos and don’t bother about it is because I’m here with them so they get that pleasure being too playful as they have me as a substitute to them to make sure they are still happy...the day I die if they’re alive I suspect they will get too sad and die or will try to breed but won’t be able to do so and will go nuts unless they are among themselves like my group they will need their buddies like all those I mentioned are if together then it’s ok but if they are not getting them I think it’s better to terminate them cause they’ll get peace then atleast but you know terminating can be done only in 13 labs in the world and Oak Lab is one such in Kanto who fortunately is my starter too so all are on my brothers and sister-in-laws and that’s why it will ever be here that my bunch will be kept and except Professor Kukui,Naomi and Birch I don’t believe in anyone but they are not alone in their labs they have many pests to manage themselves so can’t be a substitute thus the vote is all about the 3 directors here who will take that decision...but the reason as I said for this need is applicable only when they come to know that I didn’t have any of my buddies with me and died...yeah if I die naturally atleast one of them must be present with me or someone I tell them they can trust and that’s why Mime is with my mom and Chu is here and they apprize them that I died naturally.if I’m murdered or something and don’t have the time to warn them and tell them whom to trust in my absence,they will turn on anyone they see including human and pokemon.thus I ever keep atleast one with me and they know either all of them are at the lab or where I told them to be even if among the nature,or with me.just too much linked with me and viseversa we are somehow.and if in Unova they terminate my bunch by deceiving the whole world if I’m killed and they survive uncle,Professor Kukui,Birch and Naomi as supporting Oak Lab and I hope Percy will be there as well they can very easily bring this to general law outside our profession and when my brothers support them it will mean irrevokable and immediate death penalty to the offenders as they are charged with murdering me too and the pokemons so a chain of destruction in general life will be the heaviest penalty and you know terminating a pokemon and then a whole bunch of 235 to begin with the evidences will not be erased easily at all and thus every 3 months these 2 labs at Unova and 2 at Kalos will be checked by the 3 labs and Oak Lab will be kept informed cause that isn’t possible in this situation and and this will be administrated by Percy and supported by uncle.Mehu,you’ll not be me as I said no matter how much you try with this body and mind as different to me and thus their resultant inherent qualities apprearing through me no matter that I’m actually separated from them but with them present you know you can’t be me and thus your bunch won’t be like mine and so you will drive them according to yourself how you perceive them to be in your subconcious may be as I said as your sweet talking dolls in your dreams or that you’re their mom and all that you know only I don’t but you’ll get your job done against Ghostradarkarrigussonor if you can project this in your bunch as much as you can and then stay true to yourself in that 2 minutes that I can blindly tell you cause all he wants is not to be fooled again and have fun and as I said be on his mommy’s lap,but Mehu once more you then will be Goldy but NOT Goldy’s mom or that Goldy is in your dream and only your toy-mind that,that’s the difference cause that legend will interpret you through Goldy cause he can’t interpret you directly..don’t get separated from Goldy,try to be him...he’s just like you as I said,others too more or less,Starmie certainly is,Starew nearabout too but a bit less cause you battled him more in your childhood.yes you’re thinking that then I’m unique that I only want to be them and you ever want to play WITH them but Mehu,dream appears from your subconsious as well..sure they are more than you yourself cause you’re the sole creater of your dream...the difference is my bunch will try to be a Ghostradarkarrigussonor and now having even more fun in a new funny ground and being someone that they didn’t know personally before so see it through him what fun he has thus telling him that’s exactly what I want and see them as so now I’ll be rechecked through them via the legend..creating an abstract chain of fun is what my bunch is doing and in the process losing their own separate exsistenceunknowingly through that fun and they want me ever to join that and now know that I’m ever too happy to join that..yours may tell him that he is their sweet plaything with whom they’ll fool around forever and now wants him amongst them so that he too fools around just like them with them and and that’s exactly what you do with them CAUSE YOU YOURSELF ARE EXACTLY LIKE THEM and now this idea will be checked...your bunch wants to make a chian of mutual best friends BUT not be them cause the best friends aren’t abstract thus you are Goldy but yet separate from Goldy so that you can enjoy Goldy..remember our teenage BEST FRIEND confessions,Mehu?..exactly that...you view is like that thus will be your bunch IF you give them that chance...this difference of me but not me that you have,must not be tempered with at all cause thus is your soul represented by this body and mind of yours which in total that we’re calling Mehadi to just give a name as you try to be me only your bunch goes in water cause you’re no more wanting them to exist separately as you’re not interested in them anymore and you try to be not me then also your bunch goes in water cause your their friend but not them at all...this balance Goldy best represents when he tries to fondle all yet will battle all if you tell him to cause battling to him is again fooling around and the not me part is now shining when like you used to smack me to show how much you cherish me in the very first week of our journey through that forest before Brock came in when it was just you and me and I used to poke you even more...that fake fight and best friend part is your not me part and the hugs and holding my hands all were the me part...that’s exactly who you really are for this life and you need that balance to be perfect with all and I’m as I said special to you cause I’m your soulmate eternal and not about how we’re represnted in a singular life and thus only with me that is exactly perfect...it’s true Mehu,that what I’m saying is too hard cause may be I’ve fought a thousand battles with all possible combinations mentally each day for 15 years till the last two months in undercover and that gives me the idea of what I’m doing and my bunch is as well..without this idea is very hard to know whom you’re dealing with as in pokemons in general cause battle or not their powers I know too well bit by bit like I know you and that needed me to be too attuned to them then 15 years later the jovial part took 6 months in Kalos and that was it...but this idea of self defense in them has to be erased as well to do what they do and that isn’t possible if I know what they know bit by bit about themselves and the powers they have then I won’t be able to control them either,it’s a two way assurence that I know you and viseversa lets work togethger as there’s no difference you have full freedom as do I...it’s elusive to achieve and I did it by luck but this too will fall if I don’t pass enough time with them or other pokemons for that matter like in gym cause all my memories and other things that I read and all will be kept refreshed cause with my now nature I see a Raticate,I’ll try to go to his maximum to be him and know everything about him..but if I don’t see a pokemon for 6 month continuously I’ll get detached and will have to come back again but them if my bunch is together the process will be more than too easy..but as I say,I must be among pokemons to maintain it else I will be good mentally but will get detached from my bunch and they may start misbehaving especially if they are not among themselves...but anyone in this world can try his or her hand at the attempt and thus you too can.yes also now I’m saying,don’t get too unhappy if I die and our future doesn’t materialize and all,cause you know what is inevitable well and that’s not even the memories that atleast we’ve had enough time together before today just the idea that yeah,I’m satisfied with my win at 1st round but not with my win in 2nd round so just wait till 3rd round happily to settle that.Anyway,just let these rounds thoughts off Dave you must integrate in family all your resposibility now whatever I’m leaving behind currently and the rest everything all they know and my contacts and uncover team rocket stuff and rest profession and all Dave knows and you will be your Seth now while being Mehu at the same time and just soak in the unique happiness of this grand family and future-theirs sure if not ours.That’s all and just know Chu will be there if I’m not and will be yours more than he ever has to me and thus always give him that license and never overprotect him cause he is a symbol of your soulmate living in front of you,don’t do that he’ll be hurt and would start misbehaving,use him as much as you can just like I used to give him all license but not in battles unless you feel so and he won’t make any demands from you which he ever has with me,just keep him with you as I have done,that’s what he wants.and finally Chu will be your’s beyond death cause I won’t be there again and he knows it well.’..um..just a moment,no I’m fine with myself but everything came to be true and I recall that Sinnoh sermon and compare that’s why saying..I’ve Seth with me that’s all(all smile and tears and all)..”
(Seth and Mehadi hugs each other very firmly and smiles at each other)…
Seth(laugh) : “well I’m sorry if it took the wrong turn but first I’m right here(laugh,all smile),second I
was serious that day so might’ve fumbled a few lines and after I returned and my bunch’s experience surely we’re at a far better place now they can catch and tame humans too all by themselves and yeahh despite me of course(laugh) and that seriousness was something which given now I won’t be and the reason for that and the current condition of Mehu’s little dissapointment you know Trace sure does(laugh) no man the rest of you two foxes are too infatuated with me,Trace is a jackal atleast(laugh) Gengars are like this(laugh) anyway,then tomorrow or whenever in timescale beyond it will be possible we will meet again at anytime through a certain jackal being his days and we’ll have a certain impersonal being his wig to balancedly help us with 2 words to make sure that VIA a certain crook being his certain stolen Mantinal artistry to cook a certain bug ever being to bug her certain BEST PLAYBOY as her...(all smile,tears and reciprocate)...so see you and yeah,if there’s any salt anywhere I’m sending Gengleye immediately and then the future will first utter the words sweet cute idiot(all smile).happy a Marengo Night(all smile and reciprocates and all).

(next time,2 days later,7,Th)
.....in the middle..…
Seth(laugh) : “well now don’t get too serious with it cause that was way before I saw those 4 buffoons and those 230 brats which did include a most rare proto-genesis-water-lightrope- thydos-prohgomeric-dragon-loiver-sternet-trovial type slew-evoluted-dribert-klinex-lightrope- Bernetur (burst into laughter,Tacey,Brock,Gary smiles and shakes their heads)...got Zekromed who later told me just said as she does too weak to fight,which got the Bernetur to just love it so she was charging up even more when Zekrom said like whinning(laugh)..why do you want to hurt me I’m only too weak,and and I cherish you so much(laugh)...then the brat got confused and cause of it’s psychic abilities tried to test Zekrom who as usual played her depression tricks which made the brat just to politely ask what’s the matter,to which she said she doesn’t know anything about anything cause she wants to be fondled by everybody that weren’t of her type(laugh),so the Bernetur was totally confused but this got her out of her own intoxication a little and then Zekrom continued and finally the two befriended and then the human brat that was trying to attack Zekrom was psychiced off by his own Bernetur and then she herself became weak and all went to a centre later 2 day recovery released,went away very happy...(all smile and .)...tell me about slew-evoluted-dribert-klinex-lightrope-Bernetur Trace,you first,just a bit in our kanguage..”
Tracey(smile) : “that type means the rarest known,barely seen master of psychofront- tronhumder-locituvel-sidenot-vestifular zapping(Seth laughs and shakes his head) as an attack though hardly all are known and can be too overprotective,which got you through there..nothing more..that dribert part is illegal you know,slew also possibly by tromtofrenistron..but very much possible if sertrynym is mixed but have to make her almost dead and in a certain body condition it will work extremely hard for water types..dribert is to secreate a may be 500 selogenes(Seth laugh) just to get that protective nature totally mad..Gary knows that klinex part best...” Gary(smile) : “means a battle hardend slex then evoluted to klinexcidom then used r-dontruont to make way for klinex..klinex is achieved only if it has battled it’s own type a few times..(laugh,Seth laugh)..slex is 8th evolution and slex is 11th and highest,this was the most evolution and abuse possible...doctor how to even get that size and then that subtle water major type in...” Brock(smile) : “eriphojnet virtobolasis with fortabulated antimoryn in solution of 87% cyropet- creolirid(Seth laughs others smile and shake their head)...this all just only to get their physcic ability less so that don’t misbehave and you can enter them inside safely then need to get just her unconscious with a double lengthed name(Seth,Gary laugh and Tracey smile and shakes his head)..rest all on God(Seth laugh)...and we know all these only cause you know our positions in our own fields and these are known from the highest degree books and all are barely tested onceor twice in general and yes though Unova got only that part ok giving the best possible pokedoctos from Sinnoh,Kalos,Hoenn,Johto,Pasio and Unova itself and as you see we aren’t there despite being a region that except dragon has every types to make it the second most important is inhabitation chart along with Kalos after Unova so you get it and all these medicine are there but as shown still you are just throwing the smallest peeble in the most intense darkness...Seth this isn’t pokmon mastery at all,it’s death mastery as that note itself said just wait till the moment,yeah you can do that for pokemons or relatives or frineds or mentos but not for so and so who then will backstab your dead boy and left family..just don’t leave us man,water,ice,grass,fire,normal,fight,psychics even of all electrics and goddamn bugs and flies..then of all poison too(Seth laughs)..just didn’t have rock,steel and ground legends in much swelled up state cause even they feared their well being still..and you know that happens if they do especially the rock majors and who those were those 3 brats 16,17 and 18(Seth laughs)..if they call just give it to us and we’ll tell first to learn these then come and ask if we will ever be able to get these legally or not and then let us use these on 600 lightrope-Berneturs ourselves and then you will let them loose on the whole world..the authority has absolutely no idea where they are and whats just below them...” Tracey(smile,shakes his head) : “you were talking about hells Seth,that’s enough for all lives…
(Seth laughs and shakes his head)”
Gary(smile) : “indeed,grandpa said he never heard of Yrtionmypjul before 3 years ago and had to learn said Xormnuh is barely even mentioned in texts only dead samples were tested except one 3 years ago instantly dided after that evolution and that stuff was it’s highest evolution..Xormnuh with around 10 suffix and 10 prefix(Seth laughs) was against Goodra with another whose name I don’t want to mention cause its too big and then too evoluted(Seth shakes his head with smile).both among highest known physhcics may be each like 50 highest naturally evoluted darkened-Mexutus,whom you know what they are via Team Rocket and that darkened type itself was only 5th or 6th degree naturally rest was swellen...first of all,they should get their undercovers in labs then come to us and give all the illegal elements then we’ll see the rest...just impossible it is Seth,when you and Mehadi met in Yellowburst lake to these...go back right there and forget the rest..”(Seth laugh,all smile)..
Seth(laugh) : “well,Gary you know we saw a Huturaquatin,a Kufunaris and a Nejoramonas,I saw a Gulibaflotas,Mehu saw Ausiratoser and Efontokari these
all in 6 years travel with Mehu later may be 15 more or so,Felomorus,Jibinotar,Daruner,Bryrock and I knew what that brat alone was capable of(laugh),Vivopastram,Camolplus and so on,but these 230 are something else entirely..all those we know the most seen 72..then we have another 61 to end the list first 133 that’s the top 9 of each..then these come the higher half and these are just impossibly intelligent..and then they didn’t pick up the 10ths either just went for 11-20 and the highest ones each time they didn’t trace barring of all Ghostradarkarrigussonor and the topmost posion legend Justavestridulator the damn name(laugh) that brat thankfully didn’t enter the dome and then out of total 17*20,340 listed they got all above first 136 barring only and exactly 19 of each 17 types not the topmost two or three like ghost/psychics Xormnuh is 3rd Hytostohurakanom is 4th(laugh)..then still Zaroptosisek of all brats(laugh)..man Zed said they have a full brigade of posions now 11 to 19(laugh),I said well they may have the topmost legends too you take care of the psychics now my brats are too impatient already(laugh),he said bro you’re not facing posion legends this term unless accidents(laugh) so went after them and then that final with full 9 and his 4 was out of the world stuff really and then that extra brat was Zaroptosisek and hence he had to help his brats so much cause they were shareing responsibility on that one(laugh),told me first time I felt vulnerable of my psychophysicality cause I doubted myself if there really were too much ego as I was asked with vulgarity which translated to in politemost language so how does the concept of birth happen(laugh) in their way and then because of their condition they managed to get out still and hand the 5th brat who became same in stature with the 4 buffoons over to the authority still sane(laugh) this took place on 2nd they got out on 3rd and both days were marked out by those buffoons and then he himself had to return and Silim was totally down as was Mippie and Kimmie they being dragons and psychic special took the lion’s share and hence only Arnie was relatively fresh just enough among them themselves they did it I guess as Zed declares since 20(laugh) just enough to swim 500 kms in open ocean(laugh),so he did that with the significant following the human and other brats were left unconscious only the legends followed him and no Mippie was on Zed’s lap,Kimmie and Silim was in no condition to be in the ball even but was there somehow,Mippie was in a way dozing Zed said and Arnie still on the way like Palki lectured the brats with Mippie’s sudden insights(laugh)..Zed said that brat was dozing only hearing Arnie so knew what he was doing she didn’t know about other brats they did ofcourse(laugh),then reached shore and Arnie just before falling unconscious returned to pokeball to preserve the record(laugh),Mippie now had just enough left to make sure all legends have boarded the shore and then she too went off in the ball same state then Zed said thankfully that shore was even less populous(laugh),then he somehow managed to tell people there by fondling wild brats present there just enough and fell unconscious those brats created a mayhem not being Riuminas(laugh),cause it was like Kingdra first and so on(laugh) then anyway people came to know did the job Zed was arrested at first(laugh),then he was out cold for 2 days then woke up took 3 more then met his brats the next then on 7th day since hospital entry that was in a captivity told of his identity and so on needed more treatment and else then came to meet me the 3 weeks later and said atleast those brats weren’t rock legends still(laugh)..I said I met 3(laugh)..he smiled and said you would’nt have been with us Seth had they have the time to swell them properly,I said yeah absolutely(laugh)..and I told Zed then that what would’ve happened to you if you met them he said well I guess my systems would’ve got me out still but I’m not sure if I would’ve been physically able to continue working(laughs)..I said I just thank all heaves that I had 2 water types who were direct advantages over rocks still and Nivy still is the one who can impart most force the quickest to turn them over so yeah I was saved in a way if legends were there I don’t know if I would’ve had my normal memory back or not..then he didn’t know about Mehu’s plight either that pained me cause Zed and I have been seeing this since ages I’ve had such a long collaboration with brats at that state for 9 years since the inception of Unova but Mehu is just Mehu and on the backdrop of those events she was left alone in that physical state with only one pokemon having the understnading of that level of psychic and still not being her own and his master to whom he was the starter had in a way showed lack of faith in him with much love which he may interpret differently at those psychic charges still and no I sent Bulby and Muk back and I thank God for that cause they did calm the brat down..but I never realized that Chu may not be enough in that situation hence I told Bulby not to leave and Muk the same cause I couldn’t leave one all alone at the lab certainly not Muk even if Bulby except Mime and you all unguarded cause now even the compendium wasn’t there..then Mehu was forced into it with so much trouble still Tlplocus charged at her still managed and Chu did what he knows of the best and all but Brock told me later that I’ve known Mehadi for 24 years since she was 17 and know all about her never saw that state I said I did cause I practiced it upon her(laughs,Mehadi little tears smiles at Seth in same pose,Seth smiles and wipes her tears off and keeps tendering her)..I don’t think that these guys are going to stop till the legends are extinct,the name you didn’t mention Gary,Hytostohurakanom(laugh)..with may be 500 prefix and sufix and type specifications..whoever gave that,name man,if you saw that with the swellen up stuff(laugh)..just never knew where they were after Goodra did his tricks with all sorts of counting as he always does..they never knew what to do once they knew who they were via Goodra but due to their intelligence tried to copy him still tried to battle,tried to phsyic me,tried to be friends with me,then their own masters,spoke something with Goodra tried to influence other groups,cried to me that they are unhappy..did all things imaginable to get rid of their confusion and charge and I at a point was thinking whether they will end or self destory like this..you know my Crawdauntogator took so many years to reach that being my pokemons if I got any of these two,at what level they can go with freedom and jovilaity,they’d just be human minus the emotions I guess(laugh),Hytostohurakanom whom Palkia saw mostly,Seserturnityp whom Nivy managed mostly and finally their absolute best Xormnuh who was against Goodra...and finally Crawdaunt was for other general types cause I didn’t want Crawdaunt to get involved in this cause his level may cause the legends to be so happy that they in that happiness may self destroy and thus all of us simply cause Crawdaunt has more experience on hand and been with me more..Palkia and Crawdaunt got detached from me before the accidnet with all outside pokemons and Seserturnityp,Goodra became alone against Xormnuh and Hytostohurakanom as Nivy got busy with Capxexil who suddenly after getting dumbfound by Crawdaunt came back and was going nuts..then when I saw Xormnuh and Hytotohurakanom together working miracles especially telling me they aren’t happy exactly like Zekrom does that was scary cause I couldn’t be beaten unless I myself fumble and not due to my pokemons singular or plural and that was the trick to tell me let Goodra up so that they can jump him and I was just thingking that this duo would self destroy and they were so freedom loving that they may sarcifice even fun though they don’t understand the same thing appearing as variety..as Zed said I too was uncomfortable and he still doesn’t have anything at all to hold onto I realized I can’t let go of Mehu this life only then(laugh,Mehadi little tears  im very firmly smiles)..it was independent of her physical presence had she been there just in my arms would’ve been the same hence I understood if I leave this term now another will be left to reunite with Mehu cause I wasn’t done with my projection of my soul yet too sweetie(laughs and hugs Mehadi,all smile,Mehadi smiles in same pose)..anyway as you understand this thought itself got me weak then Daunty was done with the outside groups and Nivy was just about to come in my aids the buffoons releases the one and only Repidisirtiras,Birohojasmos and Duretzigzas(laugh)..and I saw Repidisirtiras goes on Nivy,Birohojasmos chases Daunty and Palki was left with Duretzigzas so the 3 other psychics just ganged up on them and all the normal types who were so confused came upon me(laugh) and you understand there was a Kyurem and a Cresselia upon me who directly attacked me once I tried to help Goody and the buffoons jumped in with them I already realized my wife is hindering her husband from going to her and then..anyway,finally these two did go to that as those lunatics were trying to jump me and then I thought Goodra can’t take it anymore and Nivy was trying his best after his legend was trying to come back cause he was most swellend up and few other Choiced brats were there(laugh) but I thought I had to intervene more so I went all in to save Goodra then the lunatics tried to physically kill me compelling my and all others to go absolute and thus the accident..if it was the greatest boss he would’ve just politely budged there saying Goodra is too sweet to battle against..but man some duo that is..hopefully all did got back from pokecentres safe and healthy..but they will be abused tomorrow again..those two somehow was too
confused in the end and finally was tamed but then of course the 3 pushed the self destruction buttion somehow all those legends were irritated to go all out when Goodra told them still that they weren’t playing properly and so on and then I get involved to save Goodra may be 40 seconds before and those buffoons go to there absolute lunacy having already jumped me both physically and mentally then physically they couldn’t do much cause they were knackered but did what they did with that final pshysic blast that all the pokemons present did and somehow their bodies couldn’t take and mine luckily survived with a permanent scar..yeah legend taming is something with negetiveity everywhere..once only experience really..but Gary all the trouble later was because I was hospitalized totally for 3 months and then I came out and they jumped my physical and mental limitations for that next one month to get me involved in everything,that is what no pokemons can do and that’s exactly what these buffoons needs to know and just do the illegal things more shrewdly and prudently..no I had to return to the lab Zed ofcourse were at Unova Elite4 HQ all along with the reconstruction works and all systems but he wasn’t involved in the outside mess cause unless he was there Unova would’ve had serious problems resetting everything as you know..and know all get get upto my nerves in those first 7 days just enough and Drew ofcourse understood it first(laughs)..just forced me out I really was losing it and would’ve sweared anyone again excluding Mehu and mom even Zed too I guess and you don’t know that I questioned Drew on varities of topics that day when Kalos brats insinuated something(laughs)..he knew me too well calmly stuck to the point and got me out I really would’ve become a wreck had he and May not been there you know stepped a foot there May told everyone to stand away and was always there beside me and was just she and Mehu even Drew was so busy outside then cause I knew all at Platue but none at contests so he had to be there and my dear little sis did calm me down with her love and Mehu too hence we both infact realized the parting day was only for our sister-pester to succeed her cute name(laugh,all else smiles)..and it’s cause only Dave and May knows me on-hand all alone in my family except my big bros including Cili too but not Iris cause she is just a sweet little kid Cili knew things about me and then later stayed with me during beauty attacks(laugh,a few laughs) and knew all about me all cause he’s my big bro across eternity and we both realized it fully only then(laughs,rest smile) and they couldn’t be there after I returned from hospital all were out and Dave too couldn’t be there so it had to be her and Mehu herself wasn’t ok so we had some arguments even then and then Drew got us out then May did calm us down all of it almost was me..and then later I was thinking of it and then was thinking that each part of the family came in some help in a way and thus to me it really seems that rather than luck I’m functionsing through even the buffoons too like it’s all just an illusion in reality truly the difference never exists(laughs,Mehadi smiles at him in same pose,rest smile) and no Brock’s experiences at Platue and Johto and Trace’s at Kalos and Unova a bit too were no good either and Gary was managing Hoenn and Pasio of all places(laughs)..anyway,then all of them did contact me and Lubos did appologize most fervantly but I myself was suspicious of the whole world then so just brushed him aside saying it’s ok but it’s better just to be good professionals and the relationship ultimately is there so to be there and he obliged then now all the same again(laugh,rest smile),then others well,Hoenn,Johto they just wished me half a year later saying they were sorry if they tried to accuse me and that’s it,Kanto is still againt me as usual,Unova just thanked me but wants me to get involved again next week so I just brushed them aside and the Pasio of course,wants to fondle the water empress so much so the she again does their dirty works and I am still as usual the bait so just brushed them aside again..your husband is in Unova and grave danger due to the open ocean Telplocus’ why are you sitting at home so just jump into fire and they then accuses the husband once the job is done(laugh)what a logic..if those dam brats went to the husband they would’ve been sent packing by that Bernetur alone beyond life(laugh)..and this exact rage is still disturbing to me until things settle down with Riuminas(laugh)..anyway,Percy only has been real sorry and never doubted me and now is learing things but he said he has doubts whether he can continue long or not cause it doesn’t suit him and he I only saw was truly sorry for whatever happened to and with me and yeah,I forgive him everyday,he was honest no matter what he did and was so against the world for me from first to last..the only member in that panel held at Sewdel Islands to say it was wrong to drag Mehu there knowing everything and he regretted if other hall of fames were just afraid of losing their positions and all except my family and Sakura,Nigel,Monkhbat,Dillon,Patricia and Nancy exactly those who faced me in those 6 finals which is pretty obvious that they know my bunch well..Jasu,McShin,Ivana,Wendy and Cynthia all said no matter the incidents they both have a duty as if they didn’t know it before hence(laughs) and then Marc just said I don’t know Mehadi contacted me I said if you’re healthy now why bother(laughs) and no Marc infact was more sympathetic then,Percy didn’t know anything,McShin didn’t care,Ivana and Cynthia just move it she being who she is will manage herself and thus Lubos only forced her in a way but he truly didn’t know what was the exact case and it’s strange you know Miley is who she is still and we had our match both Dave and me never expected her of all people to jump ships to the buffoons later..Michael Bugpoi was understandable no matter what..later she too did confess just became more greedy..now only her starter and 9 more remains total 10..rest all the buffoons captured and then was about to be terminated only for only Gary to stick firmly to the truth that it’s not true and hence they are here(laughs)..amusing bunch I faced all,all has as you know now getting recovered for long but won’t return to her in the normal sense only those 10 and when she faces a life a ban that means those too may end up only here(laughs)..then Michael Bugpoi has to surrender his bunch obviously again all here that is only at Unova but that really is here under Oak Labs flag definitely too professional(laughs..lot)..the only good thing is that there was no casualties except the main schemers against Cuo none could really save him after tormenting a Dispoptas for long only to use it as safety valve the very last so that was out of question even Genkie couldn't do it..but Percy has this idea that given all support I can really mentor these operations and no just mentoring he doesn’t want me to be physically present if I don’t want that myself..but my personal issues or Mehu’s..she had her future snatched away from her by destiny and the process was physically gruelling as well yet you won’t call the whole world but her and whole world would refuse cause they all know it’s about general government to control 40+ Tlplocus group who were mad and then one subgroup was entering like civic buildings,Mehu would go cause she loves pokemons to that level..and my deman is only that I won’t be martyred like soldiers or she cause we don’t deserve that honour we’re mere trainers that’s all and these troubles are neither system nor general government but greed which is controlled by what meanes Elite4 lawyers and rule makers know very well unless they themselves have the same disease and this demand actually even Percy yet doesn’t bother much about neither many others except Lance but he’s in Johto retired and all just doesn’t bother about the world anymore,that’s better these bunch of buffoons except Percy..but I told him that look you’re seeing for yourself just my best wishes but I’m not hearing one word about legends or operations unless it’s about me or my family cause 1-5 legends all we know how we can control and more than 5 legends you know you have failed in administration and 12+ means call the govenrment simple and then call me then I’ll most gladly go and I’ll take part in your planning onlythen but wholeheartedly then and even Mehu will take part as well by her own wish wholeheartedly that’s all and you also know another team rocket isn’t happening cause their boss is saying so for the last 5 years and that’s all he also obliged and all..I never believed my sweet Mehu would be pushed into fire just because I told them she’s my wife and that’s ok if she was ok cause was her own wish but not in that situation cause they used my name to bait her..and Telplocus’s brigade was exactly there a few days before the operations somehow both sets of buffons didn’t have the right balanced bonhomie(laugh)..and(laugh)..and they said she is illegal and so on and then the news gets leaked and etc then finally tell me we’ve leaked the news for your alibie of serious injury cause nothing yet is found(laugh)..if Goodra was there they would’ve been marrying and divorcing each other now in cosmic darkness..then news comes they can’t save you unless this as this is only serious injury(laugh) and this is known already leaked(laugh)..Neil was extremely angry with this and wanted to take it out of our profession to make sure Lubos and Percy both are under the law,I told him Percy alone stood against it and his own office backstabbed him let him go and Lubos no matter what he’s doing now saved my life for 9 continous months then helped me to get married with my soulmate whom I foolishly left for 5 years and wandered around like a vagrant which none knows more than Neil himself so Lubos means a lot to me no matter what..so he budged and then of course Cynthia at Johto will be totally silent,Kanto in committie got their leeways and now Stuart is a beautiful man(laugh) later Lubos too when he was demoted and the new boss Jasu(laugh) what a man..he cut all weeds off with each tree by not realizing a thing and Ivana at Hoenn was all over the place cause she thought I cheated throughout
career and passed the termination proposal with Sinnoh not voting and all rest saying yes terminate and Pasio with Wendy themselves created that fiasco Unova has now got the great Marc ..and Kalos was finally woken that they too are in this world which means get rid of all that is a toruble so backstabbed Percy..my bunch was inches away from termination and thus I told Goodra to stay very carefull and tell Nivy to be very alert then later Crawdaunt and Palkia too knew rest I couldn’t directly help but I knew the whole Oak Lab will erupt if Bulbasaur wants and still I had Muk with him as well and all those two labs in Unova would’ve been brunt out had the Magmorter bunch been there and no there my fear was about Gary actually cause I knew him and his bunch and what they were capable of as they have become now Magmortgolem(laugh) they if then would’ve barely been a trouble for Mehu..anyway,Neil from the very beginning told each day if Goodra isn’t brought FROUR TIMES to be assured that his psychic levels are ok then he will go outside profession and get the Unovan general governement involved who if knew would’ve sent whole world Elite4 to tribunal cause to them and Kalos too I was something with all the money generated etc..Percy was in tears really with it and no wonder Jasu abstained but he with many of other chosen ones impersonally insinuated termination,McShin,Ivana,Cynthia said yes terminate,Percy was backstabbed and Kalos was neutral thus insinuated termination too then Pasio and Unova wans’t there then so I had no defenders at all and this all is when I am hospitalized with severe psychophysical difficulties hence ever told my bunch get rid of it(laugh) and I come out one month all hush cause Gengars all realize but before that will fool around now look at them after 10 months(laugh) ad Percy was very sad and hurt and I consoled him well before this first Cili went there so the termination fear was much mitigated surely atleast those 4 would’ve been there and then Gary and all went there then I learnt the things and they were challenging suddenly my lab to battle them to test(laugh) surely Tony,Olivia,Jaheem and Harris all were ready and you know them 4 topmost pofessionals in their fields at Kanto atleast but I know is same across all regions and no I had a whole brigade of hall of fame gym leaders and trainers at Unova,Kalos and Sinnoh as well they just about got the news when the buffoons had to stop it cause I know about 1000 people there in the three regions most trusted in all fields who could’ve created a whole new system themselves and still this excluded Dave of all legends and then Kanto my own region and my bro-in-law is a legend in contests himself if my sis isn’t(laugh) and thus they actually averted a bigger collison which they fear but I said none told you to rush I came out of there after 3 months and you know my language was enough for you(laugh) and all were ok for me the at hospital till the very last few days there as before itt was ok not personal directly and in my life except Mehu nothing is,mom has all of you her children,Mehu needs me to defend herself the way you can’t and thus they hit me there before the last days all were impersonal but before I returned just the daybefore Trace went there with Cili,a brat from Hoenn of all places told me that they were sorry but it’s between professional world only that about your injury and then said Mrs Waterflower Ketchum,did that Telplocus rescue operation is she alright with all steps we were forced to breach you private life cause we found no other way of vaildating your actions and her too..that brat was saved that day cause Nivy and Goodra were told I was out of danger and they could just return to lab it’s ok and Neil away that day cause that instant I thought mate do you want us to send you in cosmic darkness immediately to see what else you can fetch from there for next life cause only your body will remain sane for this one..I controlled my anger cause that required my own efforts that I can’t spare for a c.. like that exactly the language no trouble cause that’s why it’s designed so didn’t want to risk myself that’s my bunch so said what are you implying to which he says,’it’s ok we’ll try to supress it later and only very few in profession know’,this incensed me more and I called in the attendents and said I see,so your moment must’ve been recorded for people to..um..sorry..sorry..very sorry..just came..off..um..” Daisy(smile) : “it’s alright Seth,don’t bother and we should change the topic if you feel uncomfortable.”
Seth(smile): “no Daisy it’s alright very sorry just came off and no I did say that discretely to warn them what would happen if they try to go further cause that was looming in psychic channels now and I hate to say this ever but not for nothing have I been following pokemons for all these 39 years here so he realized it too just said I’m very sorry for disturbing you take rest it’s ok and left thankfully for both..anyway Trace what about the Ghostradarkarrigussonor that got away from my beloved Xormnuh and 2 other legend’s clutches cause the master’s got too greedy forgot a step in apparatus(laugh)..and that lure machine they had to get legends..man(laugh)..man if that brat was there too(laugh)..heard that new right,what if that brat comes comes around again tomorrow(laugh)..what I told Mehu about
Ghostradarkarrigus was pretty much close to truth for Xormnuh hismself and he is may be 3 levels below..that brat would’ve used dark hallucinations of some unknown kind to test my tickling skills for an hour(laugh)..Gary,Trace how the hell they made that lure machine and the Elite4 head didn’t care neither the labs..what chance do we have that from that 100 more won’t be there?..and they charged you of all for supplying materials cause of me..(laugh)..”
Gary(smile) : “yeah,just that but I tell you Seth,if I get to know now that any such idiot is doing these I’ll join him and try to sabotage him to set Ghostradarkarrigussonor upon them with your bunch to fondle the whole world themselves(Seth laugh)..told grandpa about lure machine gradpa of all people fell off from his seat even at this age saying first trial and success and those brats work for those idiots where was Elite4 at all..and Brock I guess you can’t treat anyone above Xormnuh..”
Brock(smile) : “that’s absolutely right Gary(laugh)..we would’ve ourselves killed the brat off to study his anatomy(Seth and Gary laugh others smils and shakes their heads)” Tracey(smile) : “well,I’m so happy ever that I can atleast draw well for a living(Seth and other few laugh)..”
Seth(laugh) : “ayway,lets laugh things off,this is from Hoenn Elite4 party,a semi-male full-dumped brat got me to mentor him and his obvious type advantaged girlfriend(all laugh) they were just getting started and was from another outside out profession stuff were 26/27 wanted to do 2 journeys too much money had to spend the stuff(all laugh),’um..Mr Ketchum excuse me but..’,’sir(all laugh)..please sir it hurts me sir to be honoured so much(all burst into laughter)...sir how may I serve you..totally gets confused cause saw what I did in media(all laugh)..I was asked like what’s your hobby(all laugh)..legend taming or what(all laugh)..got off cause too many insinuating edes(all laugh)..’,’um no Mr Ketchum,we were..says what they want a bit..so Mr Ketchum we were just asking for starters..’,’sir,you know that my starter is on my shoulders now why don’t you have a look(all laugh)?...’ the brat is too shocked cause you know Chu was sparking(all laugh) then the girlfriend shows the courage of the bias(all laugh)...’yeah,Mr Ketchum I’ll see how your Pikachu is..’..Chu as you know wanted to play,first doesn’t want to go then straight jumps on the girl and bits her nose hard(all laugh)..before she could react,goes on the male brats head and totally messes up his hair(all laugh),return to the shocked girlfriend to scratch the same spot(all burst into laughter) and finally messes up the male brat’s dress too by so very lightly thunderbolting the brat(all laugh)...now the male brat is flattened on the ground with dress and all totally messed up(all laugh) and in pretty much pain(all luagh) and female brat is in real pain and can’t say a thing cause they started it and finally Chu with that sweet innocent face goes to the female brat again bits the same spot(all burst into laughter) and sweetly says ‘Pik-a-chu’(all burst into laughter)..that’s thanks for your time(all laugh)...and then I say,’see sir,with kids it’s hard to be in peace(all burst into laughter) so why don’t you trek less travel more? (all laugh)’...the whole place is shocked and all professionals were dying from laughter...what a night...but still I can never forget that,what a night this compeers Cerulean(all laugh)...’you’ve abducted all’,’sisters or show’(all burst into laughter),’whose your fiancee’,’sir only if I get the ring then itself officially..’(all burst)...what a night,anyway,my flower needs to Mehu down and Mehadi up now(all laugh)...so we’ll go back to the one and only Anabel Hojigela reduced as BellyGelly(all laugh),water gym of all(all laugh),Grystropper City,Johto,5 years in hall of fame as well(all laugh)...that was my 2nd gym there as I said after getting Feraligator as second there that too after Heracross as first(all laugh) and what days all those 3 were(all laugh)...Brock it’s all yours man(all laugh)..’ Brock(laugh) : “well the then dumped female brat(all laugh) was 22 I guess,started at 19 but was extremely good then already as you know now in hall of fame not much behind you Mehadi(all laugh)...in the hellrounds now just a breather(all burst into laughter)...” Mehadi(smile, oy very firmly) : “Seth is only me(all smile).” Seth(laugh,tendering Mehadi) : “too naive(all laugh)...first sees me wants to propose(all laugh)...registered and all then before gym battle meeting sits absolutely beside me(all laugh)...now Brock your interpretations(all laugh)...” Brock(laugh) : “her mom takes us aside first away(all laugh)...’um..’mam Seth..um..my friend(all laugh) needs um..guidence(all laugh)...obviously Mrs Hojigela realizes what is what(all laugh),then I’m eaten up..’cries..hmm..WHAT IS THAT NAMECALL DOING WITH Seth..um..’(all laugh)...’Mehadi,please,you know him,he’s eating her up by now(all laugh)’..’what was that Brock,huh?..you mean he..he...HOW CAN YOU SAY Seth WANTS..um..”(all laugh)...’Mehadi,please,there are 10000 people there in the meeting including referees(all laugh),just calm down’..sobs..’no he doesn’t like me(all laugh)...but that,that I’LL SHOW YOU YOU NAMECALL(all laugh)...’ anyway Seth returns,’yeah good meeting,nice girl(all burst into laughter)’..’hum..too sweet wasn’t it..nice girl..nice(all laugh)..GET READY TO ERASE HER OFF(all laugh)..PIKACHU SHOW THAT NAMECALL THAT...(all laugh)’...then Seth tells her,’yeah getting ready,but Mehu,this is a water pokemon gym too are you relatives(all burst into laughter)..’,’NEVER(all laugh)..that..that..get ready..you..’..goes away then...then finally Seth wins it then Anabel sees whole time all of Mehadi’s antics(all laugh)...and those were something for sure(all laugh)...beside Seth all the time almost when he’s practising and you know the art of observation if Mehadi is alone(all laugh)...then during practise ever namecalling him(all laugh) but as soon as he sits down he’s her best friend(all laugh)...but in the gym it was a totally different stuff(all laugh)first the whole time before the match will tell him he’s her best friend but once he’s in,if he is down namecalling him all the time cause he’s being petulant(all laugh) and when he is confident go absolutely mad namecalling him that everything was wrong that now he’s being impetuous(all laugh)...since that 3rd gym battle same characteristics only after returning did she become the regular friend during match(all laugh)..and all saw this stuff(all laugh) and knew the aged wife stuff(all laugh)...but Seth those 2 stories in Pasio is only right for you to say(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh, ehadi firmly and Mehadi frowns at Seth, oy firmly,Seth laughs even more) : “well Mehu bug is scowling now(all cheer for Mehadi,Mehadi too laugh finally,all laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh,fake anger) : “what was that Brock,huh?(all laugh)..(fake sob)..YOU WANT US TO GET RECONCILED(all laugh)..Brock how could you become a lawyer....(all including Mehadi burst into laughter)...and Trace,SNORLAX(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “well as you know what happened to Danny later(all burst into laughter) and Rudy also was trying his hands at Cerulean City gym’s glory was told only best friends(all laugh)...but Danny as you know won’t fight directly(all burst into laughter)...still so unhappy that this reason hasn’t given him the final hall of fame tag(all laugh)...I asked him why still that 3 round welcome play(all laugh)..’nah,it’s just Pasio you know(all laugh)’...so anyway,my bug was trying to copy my sister’s methods(all laugh)...cause you see I give you Pasio I had to win so to direct me now to the title had all limit matchs before me(all laugh) to rile me up even more(all laugh) cause the toffee she wanted me to win in BOTH(all laugh) so then she’s my toffee-flower(all laugh and .,Seth and Mehadi hug each other firmly laughing..)...anyway,after 2 years was too desperate for the betterment of friendship(all laugh)...so first she tries by chasing after people(all burst into laughter laugh) then intellectuality(all laugh) wll the while saying that I’m stupid idiot sweet jerk cute bufoon(all laugh)...so anyway I was very angry cause she ever tried to hug me but never chase after me(all laugh)...1st playround ends and was like I’m her best friend but I should’ve let Danny win(all laugh)...then finaly we go in all the while Trace of all people who is in hall of fame ofdensity(all laugh) as he was too dense in his 4 months in university(all laugh),yeah asked for the list,got it(all laugh)...now he goes around with all sorts of observation and detection methods to find jealousy(all laugh)...and my flower already had her time-limit match before me to rile me up more(all laugh)...so,now I go in full 3 on 3 and my flower is trying so hard to not namecall me(all laugh)..but in the last round I’m in deep waters and she profusely namecalls me(all laugh)..then finally I get back to my un-impetusness(all laugh) and I win somehow and then Danny gives me the badge with the advice that a gril’s heart is so dense(all laugh)...I then was irritated if girls entered through me ears(all laugh) cause as you know Mehadi is the queen of water gyms she’s the waterflower but with me those all with the Y are namecalled(all laugh) and Mehu is not a girl but just my toffee-flower(all laugh)...so then my flower now after the gym battle on that night once before sleep suddenly came near my and Mehadiviously smiled and whispered that I’m her BEST friend(all laugh)..then we just held our hands and HUGGED quickly,that was the FIRST and that one the jackal never heard(all laugh)..so yeah,we did a lots of things in-between(all laugh)...yeah,this isn’t though(all laugh)...anyway,then my flower was in deep waters at Trevita(all laugh)..cause now Rudy was then 22 I guess just started 3 years again was too good but again following Danny ardently and thus no hall of fame(all laugh) and to be honest I never knew later when I went he told me faced the same troubles there that Mehu faced here in Cerulean..in fact Danny too had the same trouble many people were using those two(all burst into laughter)...actually I had a prolonged chat with them recently after the Pasio fiasco and their family as well their beaus too confirmed that they were incensed with it when they met(all laugh)...anyway Rudy was trying to play reverse tactics(all laugh)..cause his little sis whom Mehu saved from getting fondled by a Seeking(all laugh) this little sis told some pests that bro is naive(all laugh)..she was 13 then(all laugh)..never interested much about pokemons now in a different profession anyway,so then Rudy was angry cause also his girlfriend hearing this then taunted him on that(all laugh)..so the brat was trying his own hands at jealousy stories(all laugh)...so then his first round and the brat was going all over Mehu complimenting her and I saw Mehu was is true dilema cause first she doesn’t know one word except intellectuality as compliment(all laugh) and second is that she couldn’t Gyarados up cause I was 5 feet away and was too jealous(all burst into laughter)...cause the brat had a Sharpedo(all laugh)..yeah you know all fruits will have here only,and you know what mine does(all laugh)..did the same,if underwater is dark,then what is the point of both and any in my case(all laugh)..anyway,that time I didn’t have a full water type so was jealous(all laugh)..anyway,then first round is up and my flower is INVITED to the before battle conference not me(all laugh)...then my flower has her match and all that now this is one side now lets hear the calling of the jackal(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “Seth I only am so greatfull that you weren’t eloquent then(all laugh)..all of us including your flower as well would’ve been minutely taught on anatomy(all laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “well my bee is ever too interested to spoil me(all laugh) so that I can see the sweats in him(all laugh) so..too cold(all laugh)...Trace,Scyther(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “yeah we’ve got to deal then(all laugh)...anyway Seth says like as he did why doesn’t his flower hold his hands for one more minute after 24 hours(all laugh) and then I tell him that his flower and that brat himself as well are playing jealousy tricks to get trap their beaus so they are in meeting without their best friends(all laugh)...’um..yeah like after this battle that brat will tell his best friend that she is indeed his best friend(all burst into laughter)...I see..but Trace,Mehu and I are best friends so why this endeavour to strenghten it more?(all burst into laughter)’..’get prepared for the match Mehadi already had her and won thus so should you’..’yeah I saw the match too but it’s great that she won but as she used if I were she,then a Corsola vs Charizard in 17 minute 6 round 5 down..(all laugh)..’..so I fled the scene(all laugh) anyway Mehadi meets us again and Seth is not there now so meets me 1st thing so excited,’Trace!Trace! What did he say(all laugh)’,’if he was you and used your Corsola then he would’ve lost to his Chazrizard(all laugh)’..’hum..that..that namecall(all laugh)..screams..hey you namecall..(all laugh)’..and then forgets everything and namecalls him and I saw Rudy was laughing looking at this scene and that incensed both our halves even more(all laugh)...so anyway after match Seth gets the badge and and all then later tells his flower a nasty thing(all laugh),’I see Mehu,then unless I say you’re my best friend everyday(all laugh)’...now our flower is so dejected(all laugh) then the customery hand holding and I’m totally forgotten(all laugh)...that was the last attempt at jealousy(alllaugh)...but Mehadi sadly for you your vulture killer is too dense(all laugh)...Melody,Anabel..so sweet...cute....(all burst into laughter)..” Mehadi(frown, oy very firmly,Seth laughs and tenders her) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh and cheer for Mehadi)..” Seth(laugh,tendering Mehadi,Mehadi is resting her head on Seth’s shoulder  im firmly) : “too naive(all laugh)..always like this any girl wants to talk with me,’why are you looking at her Seth(all laugh)’...and this was the exact trouble at Unova too fond of her hubby(hugs Mehadi very firmly,Mehadi smiles and same pose,all smile)..anyway,Crook(all laugh)..lets go back to BellyGuzzy(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “indeed Seth’s jelousey story is,’hi,Mehu’(all laugh)...too naive(all laugh)...but about that saying everyday I got the full wrath for asking him that(all laugh)...so Seth wins the match and returns and then Mehadi as usual namecalls everyone whlie Seth does the better friend confession(all laugh) and then as you know and why Mehadi herself is in hall of fame herself as soon as Seth finishes she’ll get her 2 on 2 time limit 10 and then does that Anabel narrowly beat her but complimented her as well...now during the match and this is now Seth observing(all laugh)...very few words spoken unless a new attack that I have to tell him even if I don’t know a thing(all laugh) or cheering up at all(all laugh)..win/lose Mehadi comes back may be angry,’Mehu,emotion isn’t good right(all burst into laughter)’..then of course that means,’Seth doesn’t like me’(all laugh) and then that is all about better friendly proximity(all laugh)..anyway,during this match Seth says while observing his flower(all laugh),’Brock,isn’t Anabel Mehu(all laugh uncontrollably)...’..I was in afterlife already(all laugh)...that’s the first time he infact said that 4/5 months into Johto and since then started to hug his flower back(all laugh) again as you know due to MY confirmation(all burst into laughter)..asks for permissions(all laugh)..naively(all laugh)..’Seth,what are you..’,’no Anabel was sitting too close to me before like Mehu(all laugh)..and then talking like Mehu(all laugh)..but she doesn’t have the presence that Mehu has cause she thinks of herself as having a gender more strangely rather concering for her mom I guess ain’t it Brock(all burst into laughter)..then I thought well was trying her hands at what Mehu sometimes do trying to giggle but actually laughs on being questioned of the idea of unbinding of difference that forces a different voice structure that thickens the trouble ain’t it Brock(all burst into laughter) so I thought water gym may be relative(all laugh) and you too went away easily with Mrs Hojigela Mehu must’ve told her to do these before(all laugh uncontrollably)..’..’Seth,that girl had a crush on you and Mehadi madly cherishes you(all burst into laughter)..do you understand anything(all laugh)..’..’um..yeah like Anabel is a Chikorita but Mehu is a Meganium(all uncontrollably laugh),thus all else who behaves like a best friend(all burst into laughter) is actually only a lower version of Mehu isn’t it(all laugh)?’,’just see the match(all laugh).’...then the match probably took about 11 minutes and went till that very end of 12 given minutes to finish but just before the finish,’Brock,so because these copies thinks I’m their good friends Mehu then must think that I’m her best friend right(all burst into laughter)?..’,’boy(all burst into laughter)’..’yeah boy best friend like she’s my girl best friend(all uncontrollalbly laugh)..thus she is different to all(all laugh)..is but Mehu only looks like a girl but not so(all burst into laughter)..best friend yeah I understand(all laugh)..very best friend best(all laugh) thanks Brock anyway just emotions Onix vs Squirtle 2nd round 3rd minute 2nd takedown locked(all burst into laughter)..’..I said yeah thanks relieved to battle(all laugh)..I knew this was just to make fun of Anabel to me in abstraction(all laugh) cause I knew for ages since when he dragged Sabrina into Gengarhood that how cunning a pro this brat was(all laugh) and so cherish for anyone else Seth will realize and loath(all laugh) cause ‘but what if they are like um..yeah that(all uncontrollably laugh)’ and thus Mehadi can’t be realted to him so nothing more than better friend(all laugh)...and you now understand what he is talking about..Gary that quote(all laugh)..’
Gary(laugh) : “15 year old Seth-boy(all laugh)...Ford was there he was 18 then,returned from his journey in Kanto...’Seth,come on talk with the girls more(all laugh)’..’um it’s alright I have spoken but um..why bother much(all laugh)’...others were waiting(all laugh)...’Seth-boy can’t make a girlfrind(all burst into laughter)’...then now as girls were also about to join the party(all laugh)..and he had 3 friedns who were girls out of 30 may be(all laugh) cause rest all realized how dense a brat this is(all laugh)...now before those 3 can join Seth-boy scoffs at Ford,’hmm..first journey already 500 girlfriends(all laugh)...’,’get a half first(all burst into laughter)’...well did that exactly(all laugh)...Ford has some contacts with me and still says halved at first sight(all laugh)...anyway,then Seth-boy 15 year old took 22 more to become eloquent(all laugh)..then retorts .ly and then goes to somewhere else from where he has to be cajoled in again or he’ll Muk grandpa at midnight(all burst into laughter)...so before going Seth-boy shouts,’yeah,girl boy,boy girl(all burst into laughter)..WHATS THE POINT IF THE DIFFERENCE PERSISTS(all burst into laughter and .)..’ and goes off but the those who heard are totally bemused(all laugh) we all were teenagers and all and Trivy was 19 oldest(all laugh)..he says,’Gary,did you pester him too much(all laugh)’ and Ford finally says out of his surprize that it means like he thinks that to know about girls he should’ve had a big sister too(all burst into laughter)...which again came true as well(all laugh)...unless his sis came around just after that,even two 2 words wouldn’t have been said(all laugh)...’ Seth(laugh) : “well Yellowburst gym end I realized Mehu is my wife(all laugh)..and was waiting for her to confess playing her sweetly for all the years(all laugh),then DaisyDevil foced emergency(all laugh) then I was suddenly dejected thinking what if she forgets me..ok,ok(all burst into laughter),then the big sis mask comes I was confused more but then one day she said such is life(all alugh)..that day I realized she has been deluded cause I was at a level then way higher and she couldn’t beat me at water contests even with Gyarados and Golduck was nowhere near Typhlosion or Delphox(all laugh) he was better than Glalie unless she was in mood for long but never Typhlosion or Delphox or Emboar(all laugh) and then I had Crawdaunt(all laugh) well Crawdaunt is Crawdaunt Brock knows how many places he just decimated everyone and electrics as well(all laugh) Ferali came may be 3 weeks into Johto at Hoenn first was of course Treecko(all laugh) and Crawdaunt took 4 weeks to get evolved but Feraligator took one to get Croconaw but stayed there for ages(all laugh) and as a Croconaw he was ever the damn brat(all laugh) didn’t even have ice beam only Feraligator has that in 3(all laugh)..and Corpish is so far away from psychics(all laugh)..Ferali’s type really that surprized Raftosmoric and the greatest boss all the more cause Feraligator is in the bottom of bottom half(all laugh) and mine is an in-born brat hence that infact has helped him more to unleash his brains(all laugh) I asked him later after he gave up the breeding power and this during Sinnoh when he was unstable(all laugh) that what is your trouble(all laugh),’this plan thunder-chairs me as to why one and not the opposite thus no point in dating(all burst into laughter)’..this was by the end of Sinnoh and I only realized he and the others who did this were not at all bothered and fine(all laugh) but whole lab was surprized as to why are they and rest unstable and Dr Oak Dr Oak(all laugh)...Magmortgolem(all laugh)...really with Giraora and Megmortgolem Dr Gary Oak has become eternally Dr Oak Dr Oak what are you doing/oh Mr please help me I’m crying/Dr Oak Dr Oak why are you called a human(all burst into laughter)/but now you’re thinking of something else tell us you are which pokemon(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)..whose that pokemon Gary(all laugh)..” Gary(laugh) : “two words(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “wigged Magmortgolem(all laugh)..anyway,Feraligator not like that few contests and all very freedom loving cause ever wished to be unleashed(all laugh) when unlished 1st round Unova finals 1st match against 5 time champ named David Nofcun(all laugh) Palkia was there one ice beam broke Palkia’s best psychic barrier(all laugh) and continued for 15 minutes(all laugh) Palkia was out of this world(all laugh) returns daces with me exactly there(all laugh) says you’re and idiot dance like this then better beau food comes(all burst into laughter) that was a kid doesn’t even know who is a possible beau who is too old(all burst into laughter) so I realzide this brat didn’t fight then cause he is cunning(all laugh) and all these were there I was seeing so many things each day and Mehu was as if in a shell and she loved the travelling life so much and no in gym she could become far better but her problem was Seth cause she can’t keep her Seth inside and then atleast be with the bunch wholeheartedly(all laugh).,so now Seth is spoiling her bunch(all laugh)..you know actually she is an once ever gym leader but my scale is set as directed by Kommo-O(all laugh) and thus Brock mind this(all laugh)..and I’m very sorry but this is universal so please take it like that...’any girl just a cauliflower(all burst into laughter)/thus none is my toffee-flower(all laugh uncontrollbaly,Mehadi bursts into laughter and smacks Seth lightly,Seth bursts into laughter and hugs her very firmly,Mehadi too hugs him very firmly)...finally smacking..(all burst into laughter)...yeah as well now(all laugh)..thanks(all laugh) for the full poached Brock(all burst into laughter)...and Gary,you were personal then(all burst into laughter)...but Lillie I have this this doubt in these days looking at her inside the gym continuously in full and all activities that only because I told her that yes you indeed you are my buggy-flower(all laugh) did she actually get into the show in public(all laugh)..and this I guess was the whole Unovan Ciliscope(all laugh)...” Lillie(laugh) : “yeah I guess so too(all laugh)..she was tormented to get a boyfriend as well(all laugh)...and professionally taught the art of reciprocating(all laugh) but never approaching(alllaugh)...thus the bug(all burst into laughter)...but she was never intellectual(all burst into laughter)..so couldn’t quote and thus the URGE(all burst into laughter)... before quarreling away from me(all laugh) we were on this exact issue(all laugh)... and she in childhood was ever wanting to battle which we all loathed(all laugh)...Dase was most trusted cause she atleast battled(all laugh) and Viol as ever was irritating her(all laugh)...please compeers a bit(all laugh)..” Daisy(laugh) : “I was told in colourful language and with complimentary antics that my Starmie was way inferior to even her Staryu whom she got the year before(all laugh) and she was 13 me 20(all laugh) and didn’t know one attack except watergun for all that she memorized and was trying to battle everyone(all laugh)..exactly opposite to Seth,who was about learing the art and about pokemons first more than battling then evolved into battle master by metally questioning(all laugh)..Mehu started as battle master and went to the art later(all laugh)..and yeah about universality my sweet jackal(all laugh a lot,Tracey shakes his head laughing) was opposite to me in terms of fondling too much then(all laugh) cause I atleast have ever been able to battle good or bad despite fondling my bunch too much(all laugh) but he first day came in and scoffed like,’how does one engage in such an INHUMAN activity(all laugh)’..anyway,my little baby tells me this and the worst thing is that I was told this right after returning from a hard match that I lost with Starmie(all laugh)..so I chide her and set Seal upon her(all laugh)..who fondles both her and Staryu to her absolute irritaion but then the little pest comes back to me to know how to battle a pokemon all by herself(all laugh) cause her Staryu misbehaved(all laugh)...and that was like the start for her to trust her sisters that they will not pester her(all laugh)...then later asked me like how should her dream boy be(all burst into laughter)...but yeah fished the once ever Seth-boy(all laugh)...too Crwadauntogated(all laugh)...yeah,those too(all laugh)...absolute brats these are including the master brat(all laugh)..” Violet(laugh) : “I was the source for the dream boy stuff(all burst into laughter)...but she wanted more emotion(all laugh)..then I would tell her why isn’t she married(all laugh) and all that and as you said Seth,for your sis proposal was about the faith and trust for out baby-flower it was marriage(all burst into laughter)..that best friend stuff was that actually(all laugh)...she was that all are very good friends but I’ll marry my best friend(all laugh) and that meant husband(all laugh) which later turned into boyfriend(all laugh) and thus none were her best friend eventually and thus Dase was summoned(all burst into laughter)...in general was ever too formal with boys and too ferocious with girls(all laugh) but never eloquent so told the boys like yeah see you later going to my friends(all laugh) and girls were told like you namecalls how can your dreams be so below per(all laugh)...this went on and thus marriage was a huge topic to pester her and as well thus was boyfriend cause that means 26 years husband to her(all laugh) who has to be her dream boy that’ll know everything about her even before meeting her(all laugh) which means again just her better friend Seth that’s all cause they instantly knew everything about each other..
(all laugh)..too much bonhomie(all burst into laughter)..so it was like and later vividly through her such pain, ‘all boys good but just trash(all laugh)/none thus ever is Seth(all laugh and .)’...hmm..Mehu flower how about universality(all laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “hey,hey you inferior copy stolen Mantine(all laugh)...don’t try to mingle with the projector(all burst into laughter)..” Lillie(laugh) : “too naive(all laugh)...anyway,then I was teaching her to anticipate the dream(all laugh) then quarrels and bikes out and fishes in the dream(all laugh)..and what an introduction(all burst into laughter)...eloquently please(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh, ehadi very firmly) : “may I devour you up Mehadi ‘mam(all laugh)?” Mehadi(laugh, oy very firmly) : “(fake sob)..hum..so sweet isn’t it this namecalled gym leader(all laugh)...I’M NOT Mehadi(all laugh)...how can you say we’re married for only 39 years…
(all laugh)...”
Seth(laugh) : “cause at 69 we’ll be reviewing these for next(all laugh),well doing this universally but out of 4 mine was most Gyaradosy moment(all laugh)...Trace is your day Glorious or are you in the day and you’re going by the days(all laugh)?..” Tracey(laugh) : “SO Glorious(all laugh)..no the other one was rather romantic(all uncontrollably laugh)..this was a huge thing in Pasio(all laugh)..sees a moon and the water is good and Seth is a bit far away after dinner to do hir before sleep pep talk with all so that they dream well inside pokeballs(all laugh)..’aw..Trace..Seth..um..my friend(all laugh)...’,’yeah,in this weather(all laugh)..indeed looks romantic(all laugh),’what was that Trace,huh,what was that(all laugh)..Seth IS ALWAYS ROMAN..um..(all burst into laughter)...’,then this irritates her and she runs upto Seth(all laugh)..who continues his pep talk but his left hand is too engaged(all burst into laughter)...and Pasio-boy says,’Trace people say Pasio is romantic but except that 3rd round 2nd minute Lapras vs Kingdra my Lapras’s ice beam isn’t that romantic(all burst into laughter)...’,’Seth,its about honeymoon(all laugh),’yeah,like Mehu wants it(all burst into laughter)..was asking me if this is a great spot to come after marriage(all laugh uncontrollably)..do you have a fiancee too Trace whom you haven’t told us about(all uncontrollably laugh)...but anyway let it go just trash just emotions(all laugh)...so what if a Scyther in 5th round 3 minutes 3 challenger down last round continuing against a fresh Magmorter(all uncontrollably laugh)’...no wonder he said we were wondering only, those two were on 20th year honeymoon(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “thus were bushed upon(all laugh)...anyway,the jackal is the only fox(all laugh) who wasn’t found by Brauch in reservation NOT ALONE(all burst into laughter)...so Daisy,we did negatively teach him the ART(all laugh)...” Daisy(laugh) : “to be too cunning(all laugh)..in Felicia’s even after marriage tried to say just second cousin(all burst into laughter)...” Seth(laugh) : “Trace wasn’t that about the quote,’ever show the sun that YOUR heart is now/but never show the moon to whom YOU bow’(all burst into laughter and cheers for Daisy and Tracey)”
Tracey(laugh) : “Mehadi,fix the projection please(all laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “privately(all burst into laughter)...hum..Trace...HOW ABOUT REVENGE(all burst into laughter)..?”
Daisy(laugh) : “well that your bee himself is going to do(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “well my bee hardly ever came to me in the first month or so even after coming to Cerulean cause he was observing the art of battling of his flower(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “yeah but at present the toffee-flower is invading -19 feet circle(all laugh)...,so lets start with THE FIRST SIGHT(all laugh and .)...OH SO Glorious!NOW I’M IN FINALLY I’M IN THE YellowburstICIOUS(ALL LAUGH)! BUT THERE’S THOSE 3 OUT,THERE THOSE 3 OUT AFTER MY PIKACHUIOUS(ALL LAUGH)!

For God’s sake I’m you wife’(all laugh)..so many times Mehu told me that only beause of me she could do that and it’s so true I saw myself(all laugh) well atleast didn’t kick me(all laugh a lot) exactly why Brock’s ears and Tracey’s hairs are angry on me(all laugh a lot)...” Brock(laugh) : “after the first six months or so ever wanted me to babysit her 5 year old self and she will ride on my shoulders and pull my ears(all laugh) and if I chided will catch cold out of own tears(all burst into laughter)..little sis we all got,but Torchic is not Gyarados atleast(all laugh)..though we hear its mega evoluted Blaziken now(all laugh)..and man pulled my ears after like 4 months of familiarity and was 17(all laugh) so I chide her immediately goes to her hubby saying only he likes her as usual and namecalls me(all laugh) and yeah already had caught cold(all laugh) next day this pest comes and says Brock,Gemma is way younger to you but the age of a pokemon doesn’t limit the abilities just the point of view of things thus Brock your Corsola then and now different age,age Brock,rhymes with Farfetchd,whose that pokemon(all laugh)..so I realized this pseudo threatening(all laugh) that unless I again fondle my baby Corsola her hubby will pester me to death with age realated changes in beings(all laugh) so had to budge to get away from this meance to sanity(all laugh) but atleast he wasn’t eloquent then or yet to start the questions full force thus Trace was threatened in much direct a language though hairs grow back fortunately(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “yeah and ears get permanently damaged if the sound isn’t monitored or be given a chance to be so during certain times(all laugh) but anyway,I took a haircut immediately after the Gyarados returned as the gym-leader(all burst into laughter)..still remember,Seth taunted her too much with unintellectual water types(all burst into laughter) then came to me for advices(all laugh),’Mehadi let him go he’s just taunting you’,’HOW DARE YOU TAKE HIS SIDE..you(all laugh)..’ then pulls my hair(all laugh)..and we met just about 4 months ago(all burst into laughter) and she was 25(all burst into laughter) so then I was angry then chide her,now in this mood would only go to her better friend again(all laugh) goes there and by then as usual has caught cold(all laugh) and was like,’hmm..Seth,only you are my friend these namecalls(all laugh)..only you like me Seth(all laugh)’..and the Pasio boy first holds his eternal wife’s hands too sweetly(alllaugh) and asks while battling questions(all laugh) with Snorlax(all laugh) and then after initial words and now after letting his wife be too close to him by better-friending her(all laugh) was like,’yeah,you’re my best friend and our friendship is better than other friendships(all burst into laughter)..but you only pulled his hairs(all laugh) I set Marshadow upon him yesterday MADDENING(all uncontrollably laugh) and he is not advantaged againt Marill completely according to books(all burst into laughter)..so,hey Mehu,look at me(all laugh)..yeah right smiling is good(all laugh)..then this sweetens both up and the hand hodling strenghtens and tightens and is around each other now(all laugh) and thus too much closure is formed so I’m totally forgotten(all laugh)..as the discussion turns into..finiteness compeer is the disturbance of variety isn't it,i thought you prefered tenacity#..The Darkened Ones,#,..so i realized it's better to leave these CREATURES#..



..anyway,a Lapras vs Charizard 4th round 2 challenger down 6 minutes in(all laugh)..’ then both starts that in between is the bettering of friendship and honeymoon(all laugh)..actually hand holding started from late Kanto itself(all laugh)..and I was thinking why the hell these two don’t confess that they are spouses for ages(all laugh)..then actually next day I’m punished by Hawlucha(all laugh) that pest has pestered me to the utmost when Marshadow and Snorlax and Dhelmise and Chimecho and Wigglytuff and Floatzel and Pelipper and Suicune and and Sigilyph and Volcanion and Leavanny and Celebi weren’t(all laugh) so next day this goes then the little Gyaradosy sis doesn’t talk with me whole day so her hubby after normal talks whole day says you see Trace I want a Dhelmise and Dhelmise’s type ghost-grass-water you’ve been an observer for years now Trace surely cunning enough a pro(all laugh) the ghost becomes the water that the grass absobrs to grow up ain’t it Trace(all burst into laughter) I was very suspicious cause this had too many countering edges(all laugh) so I asked she told..,’wait Trace wait,what do you mean by she(all laugh)’,’fine but in this case surely Mehadi should be the one to apologize don’t give her so much indulgence(all laugh)’,’she slapped me Trace day one first sight(all laugh) just like Chu(all burst into laughter) while I tried to say thanks to her for saving my life physical though mentally wish i was there Trace only once rest never alive(all un..long) anyway cause I was drowning almost as you’ve heard and Chu I only said hi so why would they do what they did Trace why Trace tell me I beg of you rhyming with Furfrou(all burst into laughter)’, this pleading meant unless I did whole psychic bunch would be set upon me alongside Snorlax and Hawlucha at night(all laugh) so I said obviously cause they like you TOO MUCH(all laugh),’exactly Trace if the water isn’t absorbed it dries up Trace the grass too dries up losing the green exuberance and now turning into the brown despondency of the age Trace don’t try to be too big a bro,thanks(all burst into laughter)’,so I realized this is a clear threat(all laugh) so I myself patched up with the Gyarados who in reply pulled off all my leftover hairs most viciously(all laugh)..and Marshadow of all pseudo-legendary ghosts who was just about tamed after one full month OF QUESTIONING(all burst into laughter) was trying to fondle me and later Mehadi got her way cause she sweetened her bee so much that the bee said like,’um..Mehu wants to practise with Pshyduck(all burst into laughter) can you help her and my Snorlax(all burst into laughter)..I’ll be busy with Wiggly asking questions(all laugh)’...well sleeping is way better cause atleast Wigglytuff wasn’t going to bodyslam me directly with that brat of a duck pesters my life out(all laugh)..well then later Mehadi had Jellicent too but then so naive(all laugh)..and once i said so both of you are too infatuated then albeit SIMULTANEOUSLY(all un..long,Seth+Mehadi..Dr Jackal,all un..long)..far better than the answer,GGGG H whose gone/EI BOUNTY search ME who's I BEDLAM(all un..long,Oven Lighting,#,..),but what does the better part sa..,you invertibility's representational symbolism's applicability's problem wise modification's b..,sorry i have to go to nature(all un..long,..Baby Gyarados..),so i understood once more not to poke their heuristics behind this sinister mask of qualia#..


but man those questioning sessions(all laugh) I knew this one trainer isn’t going to be found anywhere soon(all laugh)..Marshadow was asked do you understand the difference between walking at someone and talking at someone(all burst into laughter) this was supposed to mean the similar intentions one directly another indirectly but first can be good or bad second is due to the word at and not of is rather perceived to be bad intentions this for hallucianting to the right proportion(all burst into laughter) I heard this analysis and realized this brat is either insane or one of a kind of brat(all laugh) then Muk Muked Regice and I realized that these pests are not going to be found in my lifetime atleast(all laugh) ” Seth(laugh) : “that’s sweeickedness Trace(all laugh)..yeah,by the way it’s still was about my wife isn’t it Trace(all burst into laughter)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “(mimicing Marshadow’s call)MARSHADOW(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “toffee-flower(all burst into laughter,Mehadi smacks Seth lightly and bursts into laughter  im,Seth
too immitates smacking and laugh)..too much smacking(all laugh),anyway(all laugh),so she slaps me directly and says like,’HOW DARE YOU TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH ME(all laugh)’..cause how dare you call your wife as ‘mam(all laugh)..then sees Chu totally calms down and all then I get her bike(all burst into laughter)..she was screaming her head off there but she says as do me saw each other first wanted to hug each other for eternity(all laugh) would’ve if met at our last region surely would’ve literally married on the spot(all laugh) tardiness(all laugh)..announcement(all laugh)..yeah that would’ve been something,and this term it wasn’t so thus on the very first on first day the skirmish broke out(all laugh) and I as you know wanted the differencce to perish so badly(all laugh) thus saw her and her antics and all never felt like she was not mine like my wife(all laugh) and she the same never felt I was anything other than her hubby hence the outburst(all laugh) so went along but yeah,I also I guess around the same time Mr Oak said hi Mrs um..halloww Ms Waterflower this is Mr Oak(all laugh) but that was rather prolonged discussion(all laugh) that was on




anyway,then after I get the sweet bike(all laugh) and go on and all then laterthe whole afternoon and evening the play goes on,at night I was thinking how to repay the bike(all laugh) then actually she came in even more sweetly angry(all laugh) and may be was with me arguing and all for 5 minutes maximum and didn’t see what happened with Chu and those 3 clearly and all saw the last bits rather that but just the first sight was enough for my flower and then again we came together just before sleep and said will follow me to all hells for a bike but you know what it means now(all laugh and smile)..and all that..I wasn’t so sure whether to talk with her even or not(all laugh) cause of Gyarados but then just next morning comes up and we met again and that was some moment for me too-Mehu looked totally different than
anyone else as soon as we rather met in the morning and went into the forest to Pewter in subconsciouss I knew I’m with my wife only(all laugh) and then of course those bugs(all laugh)..but she was from the second day all about me just Seth is my hubby..um..(all laugh) I took rather a month to come into terms with the sudden remarriage(all laugh)..anyway,back to the young flower dream(all laugh) then to Anabel Hojigela(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “yeah first you leave was unhappy for 2 days and so then we were telling her to get in the show finally got in cause now she was secured with marriage(all laugh)..yeah ever told us that I’m Mehu Ketchum(all laugh) just can’t use that name officially then instant hit in a huge proportion and all but ever came back and was always that if you said stop the show immediately would stop it and you were the opposite never would force yourself upon her and thus I guess when both of you were under pressure it was hard just but then(all laugh)..no really Seth whatever you were then and thus the play this version of bifuted-Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh) and no I understood this myself later infact that why you never did force yourself upon her cause first as she told next day itself namecalled me profusely I later was thinking why wait for 5 years(all laugh) then realized it’s just the way to sweeten her up wickedly(all laugh)..and infact then I understood that day itself Mr Oak after meeting you at night was too happy hence I became Madgaleo(all laugh) so screeched at him again no force just fondled me and crossed me didn’t try me(all laugh)..so I realized actually that it’s just too much bonhomie(all laugh)” Brock(laugh) : “Anabel is alive still though with ears and hairs intact(all laugh)..but as BellyGuzzy(all laugh)..so to Seth I’ve confirmed that any girl is Mehadi(all laugh)..so now he can hug his flower back too else just that(all laugh)...”
Seth(laugh) : “right,Anabel Belly Hojigela Gelly now Guzzy faced me during Johto Elite4(all laugh)..and first I used..um..Chanedlure(all burst into laughter) the whole world gets to to know each different
types of fire and how to NOT suppliment them with dark attacks cause all attacks must be absolutely pure which is that you must purify then only give her the process(all laugh) then she’ll
assist you further(all laugh) and finally when your attack is refined 10 years later(all laugh)..she’ll say attacking is all about not misbehaving(all laugh) cause otherwise pokemons never attack(all laugh) so even that can’t be done unless she attacks her own behavioural demons(all laugh)..then will just show you how one must behave properly with youreself(all laugh) to attack the mental demons,DISCIPLINE(all laugh)..this will take 23 years(all laugh)..exactly what that brat did to Jubitarymol(all laugh)..finally the legend asked like are are you even sane(all laugh)..see sanity is also an attack so(all laugh)..legend realized this buffoon is only here to play and went off happily..anyway,Anabel Hojigela asks me post match despite my usual custom just after I came to Johto to never ask me personal questions(all laugh) many budged but of coure Anabel won’t(all laugh)..,’um..Seth..Cerulean(all burst into laughter)..’,’no I have no contacts with Cerulean City gym at all(all laugh) only know that they are in hall of fame and that’s all,please let us talk about Berneturs(all laugh)..’,realized my mood was off(all laugh)..well lets now bug back to Gyarados talks(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “right,Gyarados rage was also double-edged(all laugh)..anyway,but from this point on,the moment he sees me holds my hand too sweetly but this was his real mastery that the shake hand period was stretched just that bit enough to tell me his longing and this happened every time in hugs or patting on the hand on the shoulder,just enough to tell me what he was thinking,and well I was more responsible then(all laugh) so I couldn’t show it but he was making me too Gyaradosed up inside(all laugh) and when alone that’s standing or sitting just that bit closer(all laugh and .)...it was his longing presented with his natural character but I thank God that my Pallet bee(all laugh) then hadn’t explicitly beed the Kalos Wisdom(all laugh)..otherwise Gyarados’ anatomy would’ve been eloquently compared with mine(all laugh)..and speaking of anatomy,my bee many times told me in his heinous eloquent self that if I wanted he’ll help me to understand that how he himself was made of you- know-what(all burst into laughter),this is his eloquent filter of hellrounds and this was just about 10 minutes into our first night(all laugh uncontrollably)..too sweet,anyway.s)..oh,yes I can never forget this one no matter how much plight I was in during hellrounds talks about me not liking it if there’s a girl that wants to talk to him which is..only me(all laugh)..so now if I talk with people(all laugh),no trouble TILL they shake my hands(all burst into laughter)..that is you know any unmarried male or female version(all laugh)..now asks me about each challenger and all else or even the inspectors(all burst into laughter) in this tone,’Mehu,did they call you ‘mam(all burst into laughter)..’..of course shake hand is not allowed for boys(all laugh) unless I want to do it myself(all laugh)..tried to make sure that I only battle and all else I have to say and do is done by Sarah of all people(all laugh)..oh yes,Hannah,Nestie,Tammie,Zoldie and Fissie all get every sort of shielding now to their utter irritation(all burst into laughter)..if any of the reviewers come an invisible ghost is ever there at half feet breach(all laugh)..and Victor and Bix are taught the WAYS(all laugh)..cause it’s only 5 years 5 minimum(all laugh)..first day straight asked them that I know what happened for a long time here and you also have to go to many place,all of you,I’ve many psychic and dark types(all laugh) atleast two will be around me most of the time(all laugh)..I can make it 10(all laugh) so do you need any invisible wall(all burst into laughter)..they were dead the whole day(all laugh)..now it’s a mandate(all laugh)..Chu will jump on my shoulder once I come down from the platform(all laugh)..after Chu just came in he didn’t understand my mental signs at all except just a few which is so inceridble itself but then you know(all laugh)..all have been taught minutely for 6 years since late Unova how the breach of half feet with uneasiness means danger(all laugh)..so each time I went to any office or even to meet Tasmie cause a few other doctors were there too sadly due to their profession(all laugh) you know I had to take Sarah or Brauch or Wayne with me but absolutely none else(all laugh) cause they were directed as TRUSTWORTHY(all laugh) which excluded the whole world including you all and mom(all laugh)..Margin was anyway forbidden from the whole world the by the wise one(all laugh)..and in case of Chu if still those three weren’t available by chance a few times would sweetly jump onto the offender sparking(all laugh)..and now Chu realizes almost all of the stuffs about me so more danger(all laugh)..by the way now below 22.6 are spared mostly(all burst into laughter),22.6-30.6 very suspicious(all laugh) above 30.6,thunder-chair(all laugh) this is first human filter(all laugh) at Challenger centre(all laugh)..then anyone in before me Chu greets them(all laugh)..this is second..then Chu suspiciously looks at them sparking if I shake their hands(all laugh)..oh yeah this only my bee and his bunch can do,while hand shake a minimum time and distance(all laugh) is also specified with uneasiness(all laugh)..every morning Chu and the ghosts are minutely taught with helpers(all laugh)..breach that get your nose scratched and bit off(all laugh)..and a specified time is granted after and before match(all laugh),unless my wish that must be followed(all laugh)..and you all know how good they can differentiate between men and women this was taught to all via travel companion cards throughout for 19 years without their knowledge(all laugh)..the method was to try to differentiate his signals each time he spoke to them he would tell them that this is not male(all laugh)..then in Unova he had the battle hungry brat beau finding Tyranitar leading Crawdauntogator feeding bunch(all laugh) who themselves askes whose that brat(all laugh) then he ever had 20 ghosts around(all laugh) then by means of psychic channels and all they themselves asked isn’t that a not male(all laugh)..then that knowledge was shared here at the lab amoung the bunch which has been there practise ground with Trace and Gary and their soulmates(all laugh) for 19 years now and now additionally Brock and Viol is here too for 1.5(all laugh)..I was never told(all laugh)..thus they don’t understand a thing and thus Chu was told to just alter his knowledge(all laugh)...my(all smile) sweet hubby(all smile),so,Chu most cause he was shown my picture everyday at night(all laugh)..but if I say this guy or girl is good prize is a cap and if they want anyone’s sign we do that but my sign alone is strictly forbidden for unmarried guys above 26 (all burst into laughter) and for married people and all else in last region 5/6 leagues(all laugh) there’s that supplimentary note of gratitude for visiting(all laugh) and yes married people can have only my autograph alone(all laugh)...he has few signed always if he’s absent and so on but anyway if they get a cap or something they will begiven specially prepared poems on certain things as well which you saw(all smile and laugh) but also heinously Gengleye(all burst into laughter)..if he is present that will go on(all laugh)..and all gets caps and peoms including travel companions...and all staffs are told to not USE the reservation(all laugh) but another place himself pointed them out(all burst into laughter) cause says,’just the emotion(all laugh),no good if suppressed ONLY AND ONLY IF PORPER(all laugh)..we didn’t(all laugh) and Nivy ever says just that blooming necessity(all burst into laughter)’...reservation was guarded by Gengeleye(all laugh)..you know what happens if they are around during the moments(all burst into laughter)...so all are off unless it’s specified people(all laugh)...and that is except us and you all and the eventual 4 though(all burst into laughter) but yeah family tradition wise(all laugh)..but that protection was good now Garchomp and Dialga(all laugh)...God save the offenders(all laugh)...I went there Garchomp via Chu asks,’um...do you know reflections(all laugh)’...I immediately fled the scene cause he also had his tester of reflections compeer Latios around him(all laugh)...and Dialga(all laugh)..he would say can you advise me what this moment means for me(all laugh)...anyway,now my bee says during hellrounds that there are 1000 ways to shake someones hand out of which 999 are ulterior(all burst into laughter)...he only stepped out of his house knowing each of these precisely(all burst into laughter)...then came back from Unova first thing was trying to learn if anyone shook my hands in not only 1 way(all laugh)..that’s my hubby 1001(all laugh)...6 feet circle is mandatory(all laugh)..also I was enquired on whether Trace while managing my emotions ever broke 10 ft or not(all laugh)...and I was hugged to death to tell him if we were suppressing any mistreatment against us by anyone(all laugh) then whole ghost gang will be set upon on them at any uncertain night(all laugh)..and I can do anything with the rules except the circles(all laugh)..cause so cunningly it’s told to the pokemons(all laugh)..and yeah Starmie and Starew knows these extremely well as well cause they have to get through these whole night with the ghosts(all burst into laughter)..and you know it’s just for all sorts of battles as well with distance attack variations(all laugh and .)..and if I once say that why so much protection whole Kalos wisdom will be shown(all laugh)..how many ways are there shield the ulterior(all laugh) and I am so afraid to get these potections over cause then everyday anatomy classes will start(all laugh),in built protection(all laugh)..and the way is extremely wicked(all laugh)..he will not allow me to hug him and then keep telling me why to him I’m separted form all of my own body and mind thus don’t need to touch him(all laugh),then his own anatomy will be shown by means of decreasing our age to 1(all burst into laughter) and I have to see that and can’t hug him that how it’s all about blood and sweat(all laugh)..and this is most heinous cause each time I will be told how many times he hugged me during training and all with sweat(all burst into laughter)..then hold my hands and say how much germs they have and all the blood and sweat(all laugh)..now finally if I threaten him that I’ll cry now(all laugh) then he will fondle my hairs(all laugh) and finally hug me(all laugh) and while he is  e says keep checking my motives(all burst into laughter) as he will continute to profusely speak(all laugh) about how he has always been infatuated with me cause he took all cares of me(all laugh) and his way to do this is as you know will continue to say all beause I was less dark and only once in that first moment touched him by slapping(all burst into laughter) and yes all 23 year long handshakes and hugs all were with ill intent actually(all laugh) and how everytime he touched me means it was all about that he was cheating on my friendship(all laugh) and the whole reason I cherish him is because he tricked me with a mask that he is not(all laugh)..yeah still does this saying how he is with this very talk is deceiving me to like the hug(all burst into laughter) and from day one it will be shown how everyone else has been true friends and all except him(all laugh) and finally if all weren’t enough it will be shown how I truly longed for but whit this long hug itself he has shown that he is only here for flesh and blood(all laugh) and will break the hug and try to go out of room unless I smack him(all laugh) and all this is so that I get to understand whether or not my husband is being ulterior with me(all burst into laughter)...sweet hubby.)...but previously after all the Unova it was most heinous cause mom were told couple of times how he doesn’t cherish me as much as I do(all laugh)..mom was shocked first day(all laugh) and you know what was the situation after the first month we came here and thus mom asked me what has he done(all laugh)...by then I realized my how sweetened my bee has become..I just laughed then an told mom that on the previous day how he had to take a call at bed time and thus couldn’t reciprocate when I said night cause he had to go outside of the room so that I don’t get disturbed as I was tired but when he returned after 15 minutes I still was awake cause I forgot to tell him something this was the fact that I was waiting despite wanting to sleep but he didn’t cut the idiot who called who had a urgent thing thus called and took 15 minutes out of which 60 seconds was apology(all laugh) and he was none other than Julio(all laugh)..so you understand the rest was babysitting(all laugh)..and still he was 15 minutes late but I was ok still said what I had to say but on the next morning he hugged me more than necessary(all laugh) and forgot to tell me something that he did 10 minutes later(all laugh) but this means I waited for my husband to comeback before sleep for two minutes to tell him only to fondle my hairs so that I can sleep better(all laugh) but if my husband hugs me for 2 more minutes it means he only wants my hair and not me(all burst into laughter)...mom was scared to hear this(all laugh),said what did that Gengar do now(all burst into laughter)...then next time it was that I had to call him twice as he was unmindfull as he was writing reports on reservation instruments(all laugh a lot) to say food was ready(all laugh) but I wasn’t late for 1 second to reciprocate cause previously he called me for rechecking the break list he made for me so that I can fool around( without any trouble(all laugh) and to this call I reciprocated without any delay as I was joking with Fissie(all laugh)..this means he’s here only for my pokemons and not me(all burst into laughter)..this time mom scoffed him saying he’s must be alert and not disturb my conversations cause the gym was mine not his(all burst into laughter)..mom you know would later say that are those two dregs of society behaving well(all burst into laughter)..I laughed for an hour(all laugh)..to mom it’s all cause of those obvious two dark masters(all laugh)..anyway,then I told mom all is because I didn’t agree with his master that a certain report must not be written too sternly(all laugh) and was a bit firm with him all the while he stood like my servant(all laugh) and pleaded me go easy as(laugh) my physical heart was being strained(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,Seth and Mehadi uncontrollably laugh ach other)..this is his way to force me to express my request to the main inspector to grant us more time to prepare the newborns enough so that they pass the fitness test cause we were ourselves neglecting that(all laugh) this had to be written in a colourful language(all laugh) threatening them with hosting Berneturs(all laugh) so that it shows who should serve whom(all laugh)..it was to be written that unless the time is granted we wont take any responsibility if a challenger is not given a badge cause he couldn’t handle a bit of chiding(all burst into laughter) after match cause he couldn’t handle Jellicent’s blitz zapping againt him not his pokemon(all laugh) and if she can’t handle her sentiments on being pointed out that when Gyarados was charging not at the pokemon but at the platform at full force(all burst into laughter) so that the pokemon panicks even more as the master fumbles(all laugh) then rather than staying UNEMOTIONAL(all laugh) she stuttered a bit(all burst into laughter)..and each day exactly these two methods are being minutely taught to them(all burst into laughter)..the zapping is obvious(all laugh) and Sableye teaches Gyarados how to fondle the challenger pokemon after each attack verbally(all laugh) to lull her into comfort and thus slyly distracting her charge with full rage at her master(all burst into laughter)..and my Gyarados of all pokemons loves this too much(all laugh and .)..already a poor kid cried her head off(all laugh)..yeah the Gyarados ball was Crawdauntogated(all laugh) and my Dosey sweetie first time in her life disobeyed me making a face saying I’m trying to recall her cause I don’t like her as a best friend(all burst into laughter .ping) cause I prefer her beau(all burst into laughter,.)..and Jelicent was even happier obviously due to ghostly bonhomie(all laugh),actually for the first time in my life a gym pokemon scoffed at me(all burst into laughter) cause I wasn’t telling him to use the zap which he himself used(all laugh)..my hubby has spoiled my buch enough to get them to totally reject the responsibility mask after 0 minutes(all laugh) and I now thus am forced to leave all official works upon my hubby(all laugh) for the exact reason(all laugh) and pass almost the whole time with my bunch otherwise none will not battle at all(all laugh) and I still have to allow them these indisciplines which are taught as soon I go away(all laugh) else they will invite Gengar during match(all laugh) while Sableye makes sure Dewgong is too busy with ethical negotiations while the others misbehaves to maximum making several factions(all laugh) and Gengar thus has to PROTECT me(all laugh)...this(all laugh,laugh) was planned by my sweet bee to scare challengers(all laugh) as Gengar will suddenly appear through me(all burst into laughter) to hallucinate them Chanedlure herd charging while I was 12 feet tall and he was maniacly laughing(all burst into laughter) already tested twice(all laugh) I had to brosist the gentlemen(all laugh) who were respectively 3 league and 2 league champions above 28(all laugh) cause they asked how can my Gengar being a hall of famer be so frivolous(all burst into laughter)..and the referees that’s Hannah,Victor,Fiesta and Bix(all laugh) are threatened with insomnia(all laugh) that if a challenger goes down before one minute(all laugh) ask for the additional 10 seconds so that my bunch as taught will run out of sanity after 10(all laugh).. and all this is to make sure I’m just like the 16 year old while still being the gym leader with my bunch and my bee(all smile)...sweet(all smile) bee,but too eloquent(all laugh)...,so mom was laughing saying this little pest is extremely wicked(all laugh) he will quarrel in a way that makes him look most romantic(all laugh)...then mom told me to use same tactics(all laugh)...then I tried that(all laugh) which was the greatest mistake of my life(all laugh)...Gengleye fondled me for 1 hour after closing(all laugh)..then comes in and says,’Mehu,I realize your concern,see my bunch if I don’t chide them disturb even you(all laugh) and actually I was mistaken you must’ve not liked it that I touched you while I was sweating in reservation(All laugh)..see I actually only am here because(all laugh) ’... this is at night before that didn’t see me earlier cause he has to make sure that I think he is the one who cherishes me less(all laugh)..so came in at night like he has done a huge crime(all laugh)...so later I’m told if a say not even comparing but just convey the meaning that my husband cherishes me in any different language to mom at a time when I want to be with him 24/7 cause he was away for so long but if I say it it will mean I’m only out of my own yearning saying it to VEIL(all laugh) the ulterior(all laugh)...and even most dangerously I once conveyed the sentiment in just general discussion that we cherish each other so much but as luck may have it he has to stay away from me all the time and he can’t come to live with me despite him so much wanting to cause of so many hazards,comes in,’um..Mehu,you say you cherish me..um..did I do something wrong(all burst into laughter)’,then I scoffed at him then his apology for straining my vocal cords(all laugh) is,’but when I was against those legends I did forget my ring(all laugh)...’ this was hellrounds as well,he broke-up and went to undercover but was very happy that wasn’t around me and was in that hell(all laugh) but I didn’t call him back via Lance and all after undercover when the whole world knew his whereabouts(all laugh) yet was unhappy that he wasn’t with me means I can’t say I cherish my husband cause that will belittle my yearning for my husband(all laugh) nor can I say my husband cherishes me cause my husband is with me being ulterior all along(all burst into laughter)...I must say that my husband looks after me and I’m very happy with his services(all laugh)...,so please I said all this cause my hubby bee has also spoiled his brothers and sister-in- laws(alll laugh)...” Daisy(laugh) : “Trace was minutely taught how to marry me again and again each day(all burst into laughter) and this was hours after that late night discourse(all laugh)...now Trace has been told to mix my bunch with the Crawdauntogator(all laugh)..so they will misbehave and irritate me to the extreme and then my main colleagues here will judge least pokemons themselves and thus when I go I will face most pestering guided by the most dreaded philosopher the age realtion lecturer(all laugh),who along with all goes to the committee of CrawdauntogatorTyphlosionler and reviewed by Yveltal(all laugh) to know whose turn is it today to pester whom(all burst into laughter) which then must be confirmed by Bulbasaur and Infernape as to if the subjects are ok for the torture or not(all burst into laughter)..and Confragigus and Hoopa together Conhoopa(all laugh) of all dark ghost psychic duos(all laugh)..what an introduction to life(all laugh) they will be set upon my little dolls(all laugh)..so that they are too very happy but each time they sleep I will be pestered to death as to why I’m not behaving like my dolls(all burst into laughter),this plan is to get Daisy to become DaisyDevil(all laugh) cause the devil section(all laugh) is the VEIL to drive the jackal away(all laugh uncontrollably)..now if the veil is pointed out devil will become Daisy and herself will run after the jackal(all laugh uncontrollably) now look at the logic(all laugh) Trace is told that he is ever gentle but as he never could express his wishes properly cause he was afraid to hurt his parents and brother and then when he had to be firm he was mistaken and thus was rather made a realation to them than son and brother and then he found his family back at the Oak Lab and all but that previous pungence made him to be even more gentle here cause he didn’t want to lose this life...and he also here was gentle cause to him personal life and professional is complimentary and thus not much difference so if his personal life is distrubed he can’t work and the viseversa all in all he’s too gentle thus he’s repeatedly told that he’s a fox(laugh) so that he jackals up(all laugh) like he did whenever Pasio boy wanted to fondle his toffee-flower alone(all laugh) so Trace in illusion forgot that he’s a jackal(all burst into laughter) and became a Mr Skechit(all burst into laughter)..Now,Daisy is ever gentle as well but because she has had to look after her 3 sisters and that namecalled gym(all laugh) suddenly with virtually zero help and with the most devastating personal loss at that age and then the huge responsibility from the age of 22 she was rather thrown into the bay without any signals or preparations by luck and if that wasn’t good enough there was the infamous Cerulean wisdom mask(all laugh) which told her to throw her sentiments left and right(all laugh) to veil her gentleness(all laugh) but she deluded herself in thinking that the sentimental side was always important no matter whom and what situation and thus neglected the gentleness so now Ms Daisy Waterflower transformed into DaisyDaisyl(all burst into laughter)…
so the situation was that the concerned Mr Tracey Skechit had to fox his fear of sentimental outbursts(all laugh) cause he was only being honest to himself nothing else and become a Mr jackal(all laugh) and DaivyDaisyl(all laugh) had to..really what a double-formed multiple edged nickname(all laugh)...so she had to devil down and Daisy up cause she in illusion equated her own gentleness with sentimental outbursts and thus was irritated by the jackal cause he wasn’t doing so(all laugh)…
so thus after whole day of work the jackal is told to mingle with the law section(all laugh) and every other little trouble possible(all laugh) and if there weren’t any then himself to create them(all burst into laughter) and then sentimentally show Daisy how he wants to work like a gentleman but can’t anywhere as outside so much trouble and now his Dase flower too was being devillish(all laugh) and thus being shown then Daisy will confess her longing herself too sweetly(all laugh and .) and this is straight from the confession plan(all burst into laughter)...which Trace was told how he cried and I seeing that exact moment automatically deviled down and Daisyed up(all laugh uncontrollably)..then he was told exactly when I myself cried(all laugh)..how the jackal screamed for the first time in 25 years..(all laugh)..and how the door was closed by Sarah(all burst into laughter)..how Sarah and Brauch didn’t understand any of the sisters properly cause they were too naive(all laugh) in affection and the devil infact made them think that she actually is being only Daisy(All burst into laughter)...and in last month itself Trace tricked me four times(all burst into laughter,cheers for Tracey and Daisy)..” Tracey(laugh) : “supplimented with a poem(all burst into laughter)...as I told after I succeeded at the first attempt(all laugh) the little brat told me quote,’good to hear Trace that after your days(all laugh) the rest days are getting ready(all laugh)/but Trace only patience arouses the joy please remember while you’re too greedy(all laugh uncontrollably,tears,.)’ ” Lillie(laugh) : “I was told to imbalance my lion(all laugh)..this is according to the order who approached whom(all laugh)..so I was told to become very professional with him and look after Gili all by myself and appease him(all laugh) and it appeases even more cause Malamar and Darkrai(all laugh) talk about first pokefriends(all laugh) they always help me(all laugh) and I’m professional with them(all laugh) no really if you have Darkramar that too best trained to maximum you will have no trouble what-so-ever(all laugh) and they give Gili all company but on the field look at the combination(all laugh),if water Seismitoad,if fire Incineroar,if grass then Whimsicott,if trees Yveltal,if steel Dialga,if ground Krookodile,if ghost/psychic Musharna(all laugh) if dragons then Dragonite(all laugh),if electric Luxray,if ice or dark then Weavile and Zeraora and Giti(all laugh) as usual as personal assistant whole time(all laugh and .,Gary shakes his head laughing) always whines to him to maximum(all laugh) no really you know a Giratina of all pokemons and then Zeraora and what they do(all laugh) so he is unhappy outside cause the whole world is being personal with him(all laugh) and happy inside cause all here are being professional(all laugh) so now when he is outside he has to force himself being personal(all laugh) but in subconsious he wants to be professional(all laugh) but inside he can automatically be professional though again though in his subconsious he wants to be personal(all laugh) so thus he is sweetened to the maximum by me(all burst into laughter) and then when he is writing the most serious reports I will suddenly jump upon him snatching the pens away(all burst into laughter) and sob to him that would he not understand the personal connections ever(all burst into laughter)..this will totally pierce him up as outside he listened to his heart being personal but didn’t like it cause his mind told to do the opposite and thus inside he listened to his mind first and became professional but now he didn’t listen to his heart which told him to be personal(all laugh)..so my balanced man is totally imbalanced now as he either doesn’t like doing what his heart says or doesn’t listen to his heart at all(all laugh) that is dangerous cause first means he doesn’t like pokemons(all laugh) and second means I’m only DESTINY(all laugh) so my poor lion is totally Lillied(all laugh,all cheer for Gary)..this was the pseudo confession plan(all laugh)..I was after he came back I was told how at which moment what emotion made sure that I get rid of my professional mask(all laugh) and now that I’m Lillied up(all laugh) and Liled down(all laugh) I made sure to poke the balance(all laugh)..so the impersonal personally confessed(all burst into laughter)..yes what food we ordered(all burst into laughter) that was also noted down by setting Giratina upon them(all burst into laughter)..and this trick works each time with my professional lion(all laugh,cheer for Gary and Lillie)..” Gary(laugh) : “really this pest has been after me for 43 years now(all laugh)..no matter monsterous or Mehadivious(all laugh) I must be consulted from telling him which pokemon that is(all laugh) to when pestered being complained to grandpa that I don’t like pokemons(all burst into laughter) to being consulted on how to properly complain like I did to his mom(all burst into laughter) to asking me if the badge I won was more difficult than his or not(all laugh) to coming up to me after I lost against him to tell him what mistakes he made(all burst into laughter) to logically validating 2 words(all laugh) to imaginary type specifications(all laugh) to manage the whole family from rejecting him cause they will swear him and tell me he’ll set his bunch upon us at any moment unless we all let them to stay in our rooms(all laugh) to how to manage only the gross needs of the whole world cause I’ll jump upon everyone if I handle the emotional side(all laugh)..and now after me about everything on legendary evolutions and illegal substances(all laugh) and that too alongside Whimsicott(all laugh)..aunty said so rightly,too Mehadified to be serious(all burst into laughter)...this is about Seth Ketchum only but his better Mehadi friend cum in born Ketchumed wife(all laugh) isn’t by any means less(all laugh)..she has been pestering me since she married her husband under the VEIL of better friendship(all laugh) first why her Seth was being pestered by namecalled me(all laugh) then how I was much better than her Seth yet I lost in the round 1(all laugh) so her Seth will be namecalled throughout the match at 2 round while I was also namecalled before the match behind her husband’s back(all laugh) then how I namecalled was no match for her Seth when he beat me then after saying this about 2 months later was saying,’um..Gary,how many very good friends did Seth..um..my best friend Seth had at school’(all burst into laughter) then I was eaten up by the wife as I was advising her husband to cajole her in proposing him first(all burst into laughter) which she did ultimately(all laugh) then I was sentimentally played via my personal connections(all laugh),to deliver extremely Mehadivious pictures(all laugh) failing to do which meant personal sabotage(all laugh) and all the while the recipient said like as I heard,’um..I understand emotions make one to use cosmetics(all burst into laughter) but Brock,doesn’t this actually damage the paper(all laugh uncontrollably)’ then I was everyday strictly ordered to call her Mrs Ketchum as well(all burst into laughter) then I was via proxy(all laugh) asked to demostrate the ways by which the husband approached girls in childhood(all burst into laughter) then as the husband was contacting me 5 times a day for may be total 30-35 minutes to ask about Lightenthunstorm to Raftosmoric(all laugh) yet calling his wife once in 10 days(all laugh) for 3 minuteas to tell her other girls are more beautiful than you unless you get rid of the cosmetics(all burst into laughter) because his wife was telling him to fondle her via phone(all laugh) and to the husband it disturbed his 250 dragon gym tours(all laugh) with a herd of Giratinas(all laugh) and his bunch’s legendary power levels for which I had to learn so many things to my utter disdain cause they weren’t my subjects but grandpa forced me to broaden my horizons(all burst into laughter) then no matter what I was beaked off every week atleast once as to why the wife has forgotten her husband’s number which was as later found out on her phone whole time(all laugh) and the husband never blocked anyone(all laugh) as everyone made made sure that I’m the right person to see off the both ends(all laugh) be in illusory troubles that was a phonecall away from being married again for umpteenth and most irritating thing for me was that the husband was calling me 2 times per day for 10 to 20 minutes on legendary battling(all laugh) and the wife was told just to catch the brat(all laugh) which was scoffed off saying the husband said she wasn’t the most beautiful girl(all burst into laughter) but was rather only more beautiful to other such girls(all burst into laughter)..and he was compelled to say this cause she was usingcosmetics as usual(all laugh)..yeah the word was right then(all laugh)..all these were absolutely never about girls but all about cosmetics prices and the time taken to use them(all burst into laughter)..and the husband would’ve set his bunch upon me if wife’s name was mentioned(all laugh) cause the wife shut a door which was opened after 10 minutes(all laugh) but by then the husband was back to the obvious central battlefield(all burst into laughter) then most disturbingly the husband called me out on an emergency after putting my wife to absolute hell(all laugh) only for his wife by using a false alarm caused by him and communicated via optocal reflections only(all laugh) sweeten my wife up so much that we had to marry again by a stunning vulture killing oath(all laugh)..which showed me how foolish I was to pay an amount to a person who asks the obvious question(all burst into laughter) when that person was volunteering cause her husband married her again for the next time after the umpteenth one(all laugh) to make her become 5 year old(all laugh)..and then also the husband provided me a quote which made sure that I was more focused on ugliness rather than beauty(all laugh) that eventually also made my soulmate to lion up(all laugh) but had I told her that quote I would’ve been rejected to remarry again(all laugh)..and now each day the wife calls me if the husband is taking enough food for lunch or not,which is sent by her(all laugh)..cause certain 235 may not agree that the amount is right though they can’t take it(all laugh)..next time we are exchanging places with these two pests(all laugh)...” Mehadi(laugh) : “well about cosmetics they are monitored minutely now(all laugh) except for the necessary creames and lotions,which must never be used unless absolutely necessary(all laugh) if one bit of beautification is done it will mean,’um..Mehu..why use these when you have to wash them off(all burst into laughter)’..I once insinuated to him(all laugh) that he doesn’t want me to look PHYSICALLY(all laugh) beautiful(all laugh) cause he doesn’t like me(all laugh) and that mistake I’m never making again cause I was made to look PHYSICALLY beautiful to the most(all laugh) by his own hands(all burst into laughter)in privacy(all burst into laughter) but then after he thinks he should finish after 5 hours(all laugh) by his very own hands again washed them off(all laugh uncontrollably) showing how they’re creating an illusion of pride in my mind(all laugh uncontrollably) while damaging my skin(all burst into laughter) and this illusion of pride of beauty on gross body that ages with time is heinous and is always accelerated by cosmetics(all burst into laughter)..then(laugh)..then apologized to me cause excess water meant I may catch cold(all laugh uncontrollably) which was hot water used by sponge(all laugh) but still while they vapourize they extract latent heat(all burst into laughter) and compelled me to change dresses by intentionally making them wet while finally washing cosmetics(all laugh)..cause I might’ve caught heat(all laugh)..and my whole face and head and hands will made wet cause he will minutely point out that each moment he was tendering me like you know he with our little dolls that how his each touch is ulterior(all burst into laughter) and all cause I’m less dark BUT also points out at the same time that too much care for the body which he was doing can make me too infauated with it(all laugh and .) but why he was doing was that then my mind is on him and not on the body(all laugh) so this is a training that if not logic then atleast his memories that when I use a towel to dry up the face or hands or so on I must never be infatuated with the body so if not logic then my mind will be with Seth while I’m tendering myself to shift the my focus away from me and then(laugh) Seth all the time talks about anatomy so eventually then I’ll recall those and thus while tendering myself I think of Seth and thus the logic too will come(all laugh and .)....my(all smile) sweet hubby...then(all smile) finally when I was ugly(all laugh) cause he made me look like I’ve just woke up(all burst into laughter) and gave me the oldest ordinary dresses(all laugh) did he say you look nice(all burst into laughter) but that was all cause though the upper cosmetics are gone the normal beauty which he’s complimenting is all because my skin didn’t secreate the dark pigments more(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..and that exact statement means how much he enjoys it that I’m less dark cause his motives for 23 years are ulterior(all burst into laughter)..that was enough for this life(all laugh)...” Brock(laugh) : “well Mehadi has always been cautioned on this(all laugh)..and now we too(all burst into laughter)...but Daisy sister your bit(all laugh)…
Daisy(laugh) : “Trace is told if he doesn’t like cosmetics then whin that all these are because of testing the husband again(all burst into laughter) but as soon as I get bit sad do the same changing the meaning(all burst into laughter) but if I myself don’t(all laugh) then whin that can’t I read his mind(all burst into laughter) and then if I do agree to use then instantly discourage me insinuating the old husband idea with the same words(all laugh) then when I’m ready upend the process(all burst into laughter) and yes if I agree to either use or wash off each must be done by Trace only(all laugh) and then if he likes that and I do as well then of course he must do it himself(all burst into laughter),and all times that he has to do it by himself is to be done if hindered(all laugh) by whinning that unless he gets his way it means it’s only lesser half not other(all burst into laughter) and if I don’t like it then sob to me that all because of the fact that he is being unfairly treated that because of ages he can’t get the moments back(all burst into laughter)...and Trace also tricked me with variations(all burst into laughter)...Ketchum has got under my skin too well(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “I though was sternly warned not to use my wife’s cosmetics but to buy my own(all burst into laughter) else it means it’s a compettition(all laugh uncontrollably)...this is true pestering directed(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “I’ve been told the better side(all laugh) if my lion wants cosmetics and I don’t then to scoff at him saying he doesn’t like me(all laugh) but as he desists do the opposite(all laugh) if he too doesn’t want it neither do I then whin that not telling him means he already assumes everything(all burst into laughter) then force him to do it by his own hands but very little and more little he does whin the opposite and viseversa(all laugh) straight from Whimsicoot book(all laugh) and he can’t show anger cause it means he doesn’t like me and also Whimsicott(all laugh) then if I want cosmetics and he too does then scoff at him saying you’re getting old so now again reinvigorating(all laugh) then as he desists change the meaning(all burst into laughter) then after 2 levels of cosmetics which he himself must do(all laugh) suddenly jump him saying if I was looking good PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) and if he is happy it means he doesn’t like me(all laugh) cause he only wants cosmetics all time(all laugh) if he wants less then the obvious that he doesn’t like me(all laugh) thus 2 levels(all laugh uncontrollably) and whatever he does he must do it by his own hands(all laugh) for the same levels(all laugh) then if I want cosmetics and he doesn’t it’s about freedom of expression(all laugh)...biased professional..(all laugh)...and each week thrice my lion is trapped cause there’s my own plus 235 infinite ways to get the job done(all laugh)...really bro has pushed his brother in very deep waters(all laugh) from which he can never get out either(all laugh)...wigged..hmm..(all laugh)..” Gary(laugh) : “this brat is after my freedom of sanity now(all laugh)...” Violet(laugh) : “if Brock doesn’t want cosmetics and I do I have to beak Brock’s head off with all sorts of questions(all laugh) and then when he is tired I’ll jump him saying only so cause I’m getting old(all laugh) then once he starts each moment whin to him that the level isn’t right cause he doesn’t like me(all laugh) and if I don’t and he also doesn’t then question his ability to read my mind(all laugh) if he does I don’t then it’s because I’m getting old and as he’s dejected change the meaning and again every moment whin that the level is wrong(all laugh) but if we both want it then it means though I’m getting old but he thinks I don’t need to be cared now(all laugh) which has a terrible anatomical insinuation(all burst into laughter) and thus each time my hubby is flattened and does it by his own hands(all laugh) and additionally if he wants it and I don’t then complain to mom(allburst into laughter) and agitate him then when he is dissapointed sob to him that how could he not read between lines(all burst into laughter) then as he has to do it with his own hands as well and when he does complain while doing it himself then each moment with age and as he scoffs say he doesn’t like me(all laugh) then again add the insinutation a BIT later anymore(all burst into laughter)...then if both then I’ll complain to mom or Flores or to anyone that Oscar is influencing him by not careing about everything his wife wants(all burst into laughter) on exact issues that I want and Brock doesn’t like cosmetics(all laugh) then it’ll agitate Brock and he will tell me to look good PHYSICALLY(all laugh) now if Brock being a philosopher(all laugh) uses that I’ll cry my head off saying he doesn’t like me(all laugh) then he has to do it himself again and otherwise if that word isn’t used then I’ll again jump him saying and reminding him of phonecalls that Oscar has influenced him to not care about his wife when she wants him beside her(all burst into laughter)..every time this gets my sweet hubby(all laugh)...” Brock(laugh) : “atleast he doesn’t involve Professor(all burst into laughter) or other sisters and the great brother himself(all laugh)..and this ever gets Oscar in safeside(all laugh) this brat ever involves my family at my expense(all laugh)..and that brat himself is ever eager to serve his wife too much as ever(all laugh)..Mehadi what about the other conditions(all laugh)...” Mehadi(laugh) : “don’t be cunning crook(all burst into laughter and .)..” Seth(laugh) : “all about retirement(all burst into laughter)..,if you retire too it’ll be not fun cause there are too many ways(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “well no matter what I do ultimately either mom will be told that he doesn’t like me(all laugh) and if mom scoffs at him it means she doesn’t like me(all laugh) which is said using each time mom insinuated(all laugh) that we weren’t married from day one(all laugh) then mom insinuates to me(all laugh) which no matter what would end up in he not liking me(all laugh) and I can’t say one word cause then battles will be Feraligated(all laugh) and I can’t shut the gym cause he will keep it open saying he doesn’t like me so doing that(all burst into laughter) and if then I scoff it’s terrible he will praise me to heaven to main staffs and challengers(all laugh) then next day shut the gym down for the first one hour or so saying people didn’t respect his wife unless he told them to(all laugh) so all sorts of compliments will come to me cause to all he will say he didn’t like me so I’m depressed(all laugh) and of course all have to budge cause ghosts are there(all laugh) and if he’s a gym leader it’s the obvious type(all laugh) this or he will use my bunch saying because of him I was holding my bunch up(all laugh)..no way will he be stern with me and do these(all laugh) and if nothing then will quote poems and all and good-bye poems as well(all laugh) then as I have to smile for my own sake(all laugh) immediately the meaning of the poem will be changed or the words to show me that angry or happy I’m his soulmate so nothing is me(all laugh)..and(all laugh) my projected bee is so sweetie...) “ Daisy(laugh) : “well Mehu flower your hubby has created a schism(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “it’s the retired-oldboy(all laugh)...but cosmetics was ever an issue...,so Brock the memories from 1st journey...” Brock(laugh) : “I still remember first time Mehadi participated in a show for a mermaid in a water gym as a trial(all laugh)..thank God they were 16 then otherwise it would’ve had serious repurcussions cause he had just caught Buzzwole(all burst into laughter)..yeah that brat is after me for 23 years now wants me to fix his stings(all burst into laughter) then he first time tells Mehadi that she looks cute which just as he leaves I’m summoned and then the wife blushes saying,’um..does he want me..um..his best friend to..um..look ni..I mean am I looking nice(all laugh)...’ then the husband doesn’t watch the show(all laugh)..goes out with Buzzwole cause emotional matters are hindering him to ask any random stranger showing Buzzwole that who is that pokemon(all laugh)..so the better friend is sad after this rejection(all laugh)...and they were 16 the husband comes back who is sobbed to(all laugh),’um..Seth,why weren’t you in the show..I participated to show you..um..(all laugh)..I mean I participated to join my sisters(all laugh) and so on..’..’um..no you looked cute and show I just don’t like these emotional things(all laugh)...but you look nice anyway,Brock will cosmetics make a already cute person to look cuter(all burst into laughter)’...this sweetened the wife so much that at 16 she then says,’hum..so many normally cute cute girls isn’t it(all burst into laughter)...I LOOK WAY BETTER THAN THOSE NAMECALLS ALL THE NAMECALLED TIME(all laugh)..’..this sends a signal(all burst into laughter)..later I tell him showing a picture,‘Seth,this girl looks cute doesn’t she?’,’yeah just Mehu(all burst into laughter)’ this started from that before that he only knew about the variation in darkness(all laugh)..now the mention of another girl meant,’yeah just Mehu(all laugh)’..no really he says I learnt 999 ways of ulterior handshakes(all laugh) before going out I suddenly remembered once after may be 2 weeks or so says,’Brock,if when my Chu was in agony against Onix what would’ve happened if Onix for even for 1 second thought that he should press Chu more than you intended then would you have been able to detect it cause it was so quick and actually wasn’t done?”, I then laughed it off saying such things don’t happen they only follow the commands they don’t really want to hurt anyone but to beat them unless the masters wants so all was in my hand how long to keep Chu bound and not Onix cause I tamed him he will not use his own mind cause he is trained like that...but now I realized that he was talking about this jovial nature only where you have erased the thought of battling from your bunch and yourself...but anyway,later Mehadi danced with him in Maiden’s Peak where he told her,’Mehu,you look cute anyway,you don’t need these(all laugh)’..that was something by itself(all laugh)..that day itself was something(all laugh)...then finally Mehadi is too much Ketchumed after dance(all laugh) and Seth says,’um..Brock,Mehu looked nice but why is it that being a girl it means something to her if I say that she looks nice(all burst into laughter)..I said I’m sorry but I have to make an urgent call(all laugh)..’yeah,but hey remember today I’m facing Geodude’(all burst into laughter)...then finally another time was that Mehadi probably wanted to go to a parlour or something to get her husband to sweet talk in a language that she could comprehend(all laugh)...so then the husband directly tells her,’why waste the money you look beautiful anyway,PHYSICALLY(all laugh),don’t waste you time here’(all laugh)..that was something(all laugh) cause Mehadi later was over the moon told me Seth likes only me saw(all laugh) I said yeah rhyming with Croconaw(all laugh a lot)..man if only I knew that the brat was doing similar stuffs then at college(all laugh)..but to my utter irritation this brat involves my whole family all times in my moments with my flower(all laugh)...” Violet(laugh) : “I’ve been told that my crook(all laugh) will only crook me if I’m too busy all the time(all laugh) cause the crook is SO NAIVE(un..,all un..,Brock hides..)..and I was insinuated(all laugh) via Mantine’s behaviour when he forced mine to mingle with his(all laugh) that how one is nice and good but the other is too jovial(all laugh) yet they are both Mantines and friends(all laugh)..thus apply this knowledge(all laugh)...this means if too busy then I always think about Brock cause he then is the biggest infatuated husband cause he cares too much(all laugh) but when I’m not busy I don’t think about Brock at all cause then he’s greatest caring husband cause he doesn’t take too much care(all burst into laughter)...yeah my nature is sabotaged here(all laugh)..and if I’m not busy,Brock will think that I’m most caring wife so he can be relieved(all laugh) but if I’m busy then I’m little sweet wife too sweet too little(all laugh) so he can’t be relieved(all laugh)..so this is about balancing(all laugh) which is done by false alarms set up around the whole world so that Zekrom,Dialga,Lapras,Aegislash,Noctowl,Spiritomb,Luxray and Solgaleo misbehaves(all laugh),look at who are chosen(all laugh) this to keep Brock too busy fondling them so that he he totally forgets me(all laugh) then I have have to keep myself unengaged(all laugh) as Reuniclas and Gardevoir for whole day will unnecessarily help me(all laugh) and pester me obviously with their vast knowledge on everything(all laugh)..again look at the names(all laugh)..those 2 pests will always roam around here and there circling me and will try to do everything in advance(all laugh)...so I’m so bored without work that I have to think about being busy with my husband then(all laugh) and Brock is so busy fondling the whole world(all laugh) that he will forget to fondle his wife(all laugh)...now Brock will be reminded on my behalf in Choiced language by my family mostly mom(all laugh) using the rock-water sentiment(all burst into laughter) that he of all people was neglecting his wife(all burst into laughter) or even more dangerously either mostly Flores or Dad or whoever is free,will tell him how Oscar is learning from him to neglect his wife by excusing profession(all burst into laughter) and this will either irritate Brock to call Oscar(all laugh) who if free will tell him that he on the previous to previous night asked his wife to stay on a bit longer with him after her dinner was over as he came late(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) this will make Brock to give up(all laugh) and come back to me immediately(all laugh) or if Brock doesn’t eat the bait(all laugh),then I will phone him and sob that now I’m not busy and he is showing it to my face(all burst into laughter)..that will make him either return immediately(all laugh) or when he does I get the treat(all laugh)..so this trick especially now has already worked twice in this week(all laugh)...later he will be phoned and again remimded that how water is better than rock(all burst into laughter)..” Seth(laugh) : “well my flower has finally picked up the aged wife technique(all laugh)..so I’ve got a few young flower dream posters(all burst into laughter,Mehadi bursts into laughter and Seth smacks her laughing which she tries to reciprocate but Seth squeezes her cheeks so that she can’t laugh then all laugh .ly)...” Brock(laugh) : “the only way to trick Seth is to say that his marriage is a DESTINY(all burst into laughter)..but yeah Gengleye isn’t(all laugh)..Mehadi how’s this trick(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “mom once had this slip of tounge(all laugh) I never in my worst nightmare can say this cause then it’ll mean both he and me are not soulmates and he would immediately try to proove this point by torturing himself and will show how he is here for flesh and blood only(all laugh) and then still would say if I want he will forsake his whole bunch including Chu but excluding Mime(all laugh) and pay me and all cause now I must immediately divorce him(all laugh) this trick is also to get rid of the language barrier(all laugh)..just wants to sweeten me up to maximum(all laugh)..so mom made this terrible mistake(all laugh),’um..no mom it’s true that we are destined cause I saw so many beautiful girls(all burst into laughter)..’,goes on with whatever he can remember of my cosmetics(all laugh) changing the names(all laugh)..with different orders but each were my name(all burst..)..yeah in front of his wife and mom tells his mom so many beautiful girls were there except his wife(all laugh) which in reality is all about how beautiful his very wife looked at different times across 22 years(all burst into laughter) and each time it will be mentioned like well still does it is mentioned that,’yeah that girl was PHYSICALLY beautiful(all laugh)’ that will deject the girl more than if she was told I’ve dumped you(all laugh)...and I’m also told the same,’um..Mehu..you look sweet today but that’s only the appearance you’re way sweeter than this appearance(all laugh)’ anyway,then mom screamed saying what is this(al laugh) then directly says with absolute noncalancy that,’destiny means she is just a random sample that luckily came to me and was less dark so I got infatuated’(all laugh)..yeah exactly this language(all burst into laughter),then mom at first was stunned(all laugh) but then moments later understands it and laughs saying,’whose less darkness were you describing’(all burst into laughter)...this is retorted as well(all laugh) he says,’um..mom it’s just the lack of black skin pigments(all burst into laughter) but she does seem to look a bit Mehadi today(all laugh) shouldn’t I have a better look(all burst into laughter)’..mom says look for the whole day I’m leaving(all laugh)...immedietly says,’mom,please wait I’m sorry just came back hasn’t seen her for a long time a bit emotional(all laugh) it’s ok I don’t want to discomfort you like this you please do or say as you wish’..mom was too pleased(all laugh) then later had a doubt(all laugh) asked me-I was laughing like a lunatic being on the spot(all laugh) but silently(all laugh)-,’um Mehu,why is he so desperate to hug you in front of me(all burst into laughter)?’,I said,’mom,please forgive us but this is done to show(laugh) that he is never vulgar with me(all laugh uncontrollably)’..then mom was a bit scared(all burst into laughter),’um..but at this rate(all burst into laughter)..’,I just burst into laughter saying,’mom,I’ve never told you before but when he confessed to me first time all those 13 years back he said 2 words(all laugh uncontrollably)’...mom was spellbounded(all laugh),I almost had convulsions laughing(all laugh),’he agitated me then suddenly grabbed my hands and hugged me saying in this tone,’attitude?’(all burst into laughter)...then to make sure that we go to privacy cause that was in reservation(all laugh) he in this tone said,’privately’(all burst into laughter)...he just wants to show that he asks for permissions(all laugh) despite the fact that I’m coming here for 18 years now(all laugh) and calling you mom for exactly those many years(all laugh) and still if you think that he is at all ashamed that now I’m his wife so he has to have some reservations then you’re very much mistaken cause you know me and us for 18 years(all laugh) out of total 20 and I want to highlight these 18 years cause according to him this is the timespan of your knowledge of me in-his-tone PHYSICALLY(all brust into laughter)..he doesn’t at all have any reservations to his family about our 22 year long relationship rather I have(all laugh).he never knew anything beyond me in personal life nor did he ever try to or even had the remote thought of doing so first he confessed to me at my own home(all burst into laughter) well all of my bro-in-laws did except the one that could feel it(all laugh) then after he confessed to me first time,he didn’t have any problem calling you himself to straight say that I was his girlfriend(all burst into laughter) or even to my own sisters at our own home that he wants to pass some time alone with me(all burst into laughter) and thus now after so many years and all he is not at all ashamed to hug me in front of his family(all laugh) and infact fervantly regrets not doing so first thing 18 years ago(all burst into laughter) and infact this I know I shouldn’t say but if I don’t he himself will may be someday in his characteristic language that had dad been present dad he would’ve been more happy to do so cause he would’ve shown him that he with the double trophies also has got married(all laugh) and so many times told me that if my mom and dad was present he after confessing might’ve directely taken me away with him(all burst into laughter) and all these is because he never has had anything to hide at all and thus thinks if you think after all these 22 years he should have some reservations about  e in front of you means you’re accusing him of vulgarity(All laugh) and thus these all is so that you know our relationship is so natural and longstanding that it’s too just easy for us and there’s no thought of vulgarity in him cause to him I’ve been his wife since he first saw me and thus only has thought about me and that too as a long married wife only but he would also put many more constraints on the word so you know what he is trying to do without any hesitation what-so-ever to anyone that he feels accuses him of vulgarity(all laugh) and you know to him why the differece would persist(all laugh) so I was the meeting point of the difference and the non difference hence only his wife exactly which you know was hallucinated to him in Unova hence the troubles(all laugh) and thus for him it’s just me and that’s the end of anything else in personal life cause rest is implausible to him(all laugh) and always told you about that but just didn’t have the language which he now has and is telling you that he is born as my husband and me as his wife and we will be so again and again like soulmates(all laugh) the exact word he wants to hear about us from the whole world but with rigourous proof(all laugh) and this all is done to show that not by a chance are we together but rather an inevitability so that you never think that I or he is neglecting you(all burst into laughter) cause we’re too easy about ourselves and it’s natural and it’s been too long now(all laugh) so there’s no trouble at all(all laugh)..then mom finally was almost in tears laughing(all laugh) said,’I see totally Mehadified for 22 years from first sight(all laugh) and infact his vultures include me as well(all uncontrollably laugh) but I only hope he atleast spares the vultures for accusing his own parents(uncontrollably laugh,tears)’,I said he doesn’t(all laugh uncontrollably,tears,fits of laughter) to this mom almost fainted(all laugh) then I said he knows every detail about how my parents met and married too(all burst into laughter) then he was summoned(all laugh),’Seth,what do you know about your dad(all laugh)?’,then saw me silently laughing(all laugh) so realized it and with absolute nonchalancy asks,’um..you mean his career details or about how he and you got married(all burst into laughter)?’ then mom is very angry(all laugh) says,’career I know your reach is too dark now(all burst into laughter) but why are you trying to lessen the darkness in places where it should be absolutely dark to absolutely everyone except the two concerned(all laugh) and why are you telling people around whatever you’ve done in darkness for quarter of a century with your wife(all burst into laughter)?’,then this of course doesn’t appease my hubby cause dad’s career he came to know in full later which must be told to mom umpteenth times to make her realize that the memories mean rather than the obvious dad is still present(both laugh,all else smile) so uses the dark pests to control both of us and says,’no career in detailes I only came to know now,(starter Charmander became Charmillion refused to evolve further,then Infernape,Talonflame,Delphox,Heatmore,Rapidash,Incineroar,Plusle,Blacephalon,Arcanine,Salazzle,Magmorter,Ho-Oh and Volcarona) then had a Floatzel and a Meganium only who both came in those 2 months that he was at Kanto then later 2 pseudo-legends in Arcanine and Ho-Oh and you saw all of these except the 2 and then he started Kanto at 17 and 4,had to return in 2 months at 17 and 6(laughs,all laugh,Seth laughs a lot) went to a gym last that was Pewter when he was returning and used all his pokemon Mrs Hazel Corter Bentgus was the leader there Flint uncle’s maternal aunt she was at the very fag end of her career then Flint uncle was doing his gym qualification journeies may be at Unova at that time(all laugh),then dad studied at Frucifern in the same vocational school that Jerry uncle told Zed to study but he declined saying Cerulean encompasses the water transports too for mechanics if large enough they need food too(all laugh..lot) but dad did electrical course unlike Zed for 2.5 years till 20 and 3 exactly(all laugh) then was there for 5 long years at Frucifern as an electrician itself working then had somewhat finances so went out once more at 25 and 6 to Kanto again this time looking to become fire type expert got most of bunch then 13 in total travelled for 2.75 years and completed the minimum at 28 and 2 but couldn’t continue after that knew it as well so he returned so was settled at Frucifern again doing both his electrical works and working as a fire expert in locals had a skill with fire types despite not having many dual type fire pokemons and only 2 pseudo-legends but only did one region so it was understandable then by virtue of that journey and also his skills made some good money at Frucifern for 1.75 more years and then when he was 30 and 7 met you at 20 years your birth month in Starmie’s psychic channel told the first adding in Staryu’s the last in Masquerin’s the most ENSUING(all burst into laughter,Seth uncontrollbaly laughs  ehadi,Mehadi in tears laughing) so at Shamrockmoss you were by then just 4 months at the hotel after completing your necessary degrees in culinary skills inspired by you only mom I ever say so delicious the food(all brust into laughter,Seth ucnontrollbaly laughs)..mom was like a volcano this point(all laugh)..so I realized how much my cunning bee was enjoying it(all laugh,Seth and Mehadi laugh a lot)..and the job at that hotel and all your degrees all were done in the same city(all laugh)..sorry just a moment Mime get me a glass of water sweetie(All laugh),an excuse to use Kyog’s psychic channel which mind you neither is mine nor his pokemon and I didn’t catch him either is a gym pokemon whose immediate predecessor’s parents catcher wasn’t even grandpa(all laugh) spent 5 weeks at the gym in an unstable condition(all laugh) so used that to say so many came home from schools,hotels and parties and journeys and institutions dear in Godly’s channel said what purpose do they actually serve now Octillery’s gender,gender everywhere(all brust into laughter,Seth uncontrollbaly laughs,Mehadi laughs a lot),anyway mom didn’t get it cause intentionally was coughing(all laugh) anyway then restarted,and then you went to Frucifern with him afterwards when he was 30 and 10 and you 20 and 3(all laugh a lot),then did your work at a bigger hotel for 2 years from 20 and 6 till 22 and 5 sorry mom just a call excuse me(all laugh)..went out pests were still on(all laugh) then using Slowbro,Corsie,Castie and Poli’s channel told..
Dialga don’t be a gambler just spin the wheel/when situations or finances challenge put up the look of that emotional steel(uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter,all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,Brock hides his face laughing a lot,Violet uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter,Seth uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter  ehadi)/around you what is happening if you really need to FEEL(all laugh,Brock in same pose shakes his head)/look at your own self then when tiredness comes isn’t it cause of your own excess outward ZEAL(all brust into laughter,Brock pats his forehead laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs)?
using Clittlie,
la la la la la la la la oh my dear Mehadi(all laugh,Seth shakes his head laughing) using Cramie,
remember the names and surnames AH! Hoopa pa pa Decidu du du du du du du du duYE(uncontrollbaly laughs,all uncontrollaby laugh,tears and fits of laughter,Seth in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter  ehadi)..and ofcourse only a Decidueye can understand that it’s not an actual Decidueye call in psychic channels(all laugh a lot)..then somehow I returned excusing dust particles(all laugh),pests were on so mom thought may be something serious made a face so was concerned(all laugh),he said no nothing and then using Staryu’s channel again told me thickening(all laugh,Seth laughs a lot) then continued(all laugh) so for 2 years you and dad were at Frucifern this house was getting rebuilt then then at 22 and 6 and he at 33 and 1 came here at Pallet at Dave’s home(all laugh) then dad continued to work at Frucifern then Zed came when you were 23 and 2 and dad 33 and 9 then me,Mehu,Aurie and Gary were summoned by you and dad and mom and Will uncle and Glori aunty and Larry just delible and Cassey look gullible(all laugh a lot),Gary said look Dr Oak doesn’t tolerate any siblings in professional life cause they personally insist Mr Oak to remain improfessional to them becoming Gary Oak(all laugh) so..*


and both of us told Aurie that look those two are most gullible ones(all laugh)..*


and both of us told Aurie that look those two are most gullible ones(all laugh)..*


Mehu said if theres more than one 11 year old married couples in the at the same place and clan then it’s a massive problem so I go to Cerulean to continue the flower business there(all laugh)..*


so I said fine you go there I come here(all laugh)?


then I was designated when you were 27 and 4 and Dad 37 and 11(all laugh a lot,Seth shakes his head laughing),then within 6 weeks dad then went out on an emergency when he was 38 and 1 then inside our minds Meganium wasn’t taken but I saw her till I was 4 months old.) was ill actually for 1.5 years was naturally so but my bunch doesn’t get ill as you know and many like mostly Phampie and Tyrie both have birth related problems..surely(all laugh) cause according to my Butterfree how can you or how can you not if you know you are the disease itself hence the viseversa(all burst into laughter) while Palkia says you can’t know a disease only the understanding of you being unwell hence you can never be well either can you(all brust into laughter) but dad never had the time to get them WOKEN(all laugh) so would’ve been very happy had he been present here especially knowing that a Sableye is indeed a hard pokemon to be WOKEN(all laugh) and the fire gym and so on just the time given and he would’ve been here during the Pasio break at 59 and 9(all laugh) when you at 49 and 2 met your daughter-in-law at 21 and 11 first PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) then those two pests were off(all laugh)..so mom was extremely angry says,’yeah I’m 70.25 JUST ABOUT now(all burst into laughter) so at 20(all burst into laughter) what I felt should be exactly there(all burst into laughter) and also same for your dad cause I also happen to be your mom(all burst into laughter) so I happen to know that at 80.75 he wouldn’t have liked to listen to what his son has extracted about his MENTAL ACTIVITIES at 30.66 IN ALL DUE HONESTY(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) via these two dark menaces to society lurking behind the same with FULL FREEDOM TICKLING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) so tell me about the other halves and these two venerables have bestowed and IS BESTOWING upon you exactly why that glass of water and ring of fires(all burst into laughter,Seth uncontrollably laughs in tears laughing)..’,so my hubby was silently laughing like nothing I could understand(all laugh) and says WITHOUT THE VENERABLE HELP(all laugh) that,well,mom you know about me and Mehu only too well it’s ever been that we got married at the very first sight(all laugh) cause we’re married since eternity(all laugh) and as a result you see she is calling you mom for 20 years now(all laugh) the previous four was because she didn’t want to foist herself upon you(all burst into laughter,Seth and Mehadi laugh a lot ach other) when she called you aunty never by name still(all laugh) though I namecalled my sisters left and right(all laugh) cause I couldn’t do the same with Zed as you know(all laugh) his mates used to call him Zeddy he said it’s an waste of effort isn’t it(all laugh),hence Mehu told me I have 3 elder sisters and then told me about them all of whom I knew for years Violet from even before(all laugh) cause I’ve been a follower of her works since she started at just 17 as you know such great is her deductive and inductive powers felt it so earlier at psychophysical despondency(all laugh,Brock pats his forehead laughing,Violet laughs a lot) then both me and Gary knew mom for ages(all laugh) and Daisy might’ve seen her a few times can’t recall certainly knew about all of 9 cities too well(all laugh),Flint uncle we’ve seen many times,Mr Jerry too who was a lifelong staunch supporter of the lab against Frucifern’s irregularities I went to his gym first after proposing to Mehu first PHYSICALLY(all brust into laughter,Seth uncontrollbaly laughs  ehadi) he was on his very last month infact I’ve met the gym leader who followed him as well then as you know(all laugh) but a most intimate collaboration still looms once he restarts at a City that I recommended(all laugh) at Unova(all laugh) so then Zed told us that he found out that the Cerulean sinisters sorry sisters(all laugh) were 4 in number in total but said if translated it becomes the younger two are spoiled brats with too much money and care(all laugh)..so.) then I infact did know about them but not exactly who they were cause Lillie was in Pasio and Mehu was yet to start then I bumped into Mehu accidentally then later came to know her name much later in the day infact(all laugh) then I heard this and then she told me about them I realized they are as much my sisters certainly Violet was too precious for me to not survellience cause I needed her works desperately then I heard this name Lillie instantly my mind told him use a rhythm say Lillie flower(all laugh),and then to deepen it realized her relationship with Mehu(all laugh),so I knew rather than too much money or care these two are too sweetie rather(all laugh)..and you know exactly why me and Mr Oak are most cunning pros(all laugh) but that fox waited for 8 years you know that’s an academic pro(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing)


but then this name again re-entered my ears giving a whole new light upon the person as I heard the name of her eldest sis Ms Daisy Waterflower(all laugh) I understood I’ll chew her up each day cause with 3 younger sisters with Violet being such a star already that I knew and then was seeing another from close view(all laugh) and the gym and not much guidance she will be so delicious the food(all laugh)?


and you also may know Brock and Trace ever knew about us and the viseversa it’s no big deal and neither is it for Gary and the darkness is maintained at right places but about us I just ever told our family my brothers here and sister-in-laws that’s all all too well known to them just a get together that we enjoy cause I’m back after such a fiasco and have had to deal with this much and Mehu even way more than me just reminiscences I only ever told them that I intentionally held her hands with ulterior motives(all laugh) at the age of 17.75 for the first time(all burst into laughter) but the ulterior part didn’t materialize as the word suggests in general cause the motive was only to have her near me and I only ever want to lose myself at her presence  er at most that’s all and I’ve been doing the atmost for about 18 years now right in front of Brock cause he was the one who permitted it(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollably laughs) and never tried to remember when I held her hands before that if Trace was there or not(all laugh) cause he was surprized seeing the lack of further closure which he desperately advocated for(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and neither did the two ever bother about us only telling us to make it formal ever(all burst into laughter) cause one of them were having hard luck in this issue with time zones and expression and the other was still ALONE(all laugh) and they ever you know are both of our big bros being extremely sly foxes(all burst into laughter) only too happy to see this and we the same though they do keep things in darkness way more than us(all burst into laughter) but very soon Gary will be forced out of it in the .125 position by Lillie don’t worry won’t be semi(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) it is necessary for him to get out of his professional bush else he will chide his son left and right day one for not calling himself and himself Mr Oak(all laugh) thus he needs to get A BIT NAIVE(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock uncontrollbaly laughs) and Lillie needs this cause she’s too scared of life not herself hence this is important to get her WOKEN(all laugh) cause the translators needs the right approach to the unfoldment from psychophysical wigs(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) but about the darkness it doesn’t matter cause Mehu knows everything personal the moments and thus me too(all laugh) it’s no big deal a husbandand wife hugs after a long separation for a month or two due to works anywhere public or private no big deal as the public is only family and not random strangers(all laugh) or even if strangers there’s no vulgarity(all laugh) so hardly a big deal for us though we don’t do it in public like certain someone not high in life(all laugh) at Kalos tried and thus the whole family can’t forget the lesson atleast till that specific temporal distance(all burst into laughter) but also like at a secluded forest(all laugh) or a gym reservation area cause both even if not public has pokemons(all burst into
laughter) but I always hugged her right in front of my bunch(all laugh) cause Heracross and Bayleaf do so right in front of me why(all brust into laughter) so I only do what they advise me to(all brust into laughter) and thus many then now all know that Mehu is their second master for this life which you surely know with my Chu being with Mehu all the time no matter what even went in pokeballs and even obeyed her more than me may be cause he too agreed with me on being asked(all laugh) that she’s my soulmate cause she was tolerated by him(all burst
into laughter) and about dad,well I told you a bit about the career and about the first time you met him it’s same as Mehu met me no difference just asked Mr Carl about it(all laugh) too happily said and Mrs Perry too confirmed(all laugh)..then got Mr Jonathan,Bobby,Leslie(all laugh) and also Mrs Elizabeth and Becca(all laugh) so yeah about the first sight I know about his position same as me and Mehu knows your position(all burst into laughter) or the viseversa cause this idea of gender is rather confining(all burst into laughter) hence the word is parenthood that I got surely but in general too cause it deson’t have the despondency of gender(all burst into laughter) so your position was same as her and the only thing was that dad was in an extremely difficult situation not then but before for very long which despite his absence he made sure I never had to face and you weren’t in our profession just that Pidgey(all laugh) 1.5 months,should’ve kept her like Zara has(all laugh) but now if you learn 7 days about Mime more throughly while training her to be more connected to you and yourself to her and interpret that in your language then you can take down a bunch Mexutus for sure (all laugh) without battling as you know(all laugh) so enough professionality cause it means you’re atleast 6 league but all of 7 Elite4 in hall of fame(all laugh) and about the 5 days(all laugh) they told what they know and could recall and from what I heard from you and may be from Professor(all laugh) I in my ideas and by my intuitions filled up the rest(all burst into laughter) and no it’s understandable dad were at a situation in his life then whhere things had taken a toll on him and the reasons of which I will come to know and has by means of the expansion of this lab many chosen vultures has come up thus it’s AH!so maddening(all laugh) dad was a bit emotional person a bit serious bit on the edge with adventures and determined to do everything right in his power to everyone including his bunch always nice man but according to my bunch that is these two unless awakened he was our typicl delicious food(all brust into laughter) no my mental behaviour and point of view has been same for dad as well as it has for you I don’t understand why would the difference persist as my bunch says it’s implausible that a offspring isn’t with the parents in abstraction of fondness otherwise how can a new-born brat get the love and affection that he doesn’t ask for rather asks for my bunch describes as unanimously mutable tickling(all brust into laughter)


and no a few vultures may instigate you to say(bursts into laughter,all laugh a lot,Seth bursts into laughter)


so then he met you at a formal party spoke a bit then a bit more later and so on then a few collbaorations of rather happy nature(all laugh) and mom was so extremely angry at this which made my hubby so happy(all laugh) so he continues silently laughing like nothing and the two pests were doing what they do(all laugh) so he says,thus it took 4/5 days to confirm your marriage with dad and then you came here this home was renovated and so on but dad was rather serious those days which isn’t at all welcome by my bunch(all laugh) hence now he is here in the lab as you are in your form(all laugh) this is a nice place governed by Gengar and Sableye(all laugh) by means of telling people how to get WOKEN(all laugh) anyway then that misfortune happens then I am born but before that aunty also goes inside Gary’s mind then uncle a few years later too and our times here wasn’t at all good then Professor was very steady virtually took care of both the families you worked in this office here I was brought up in the lab,Gary in the park(all laugh) where he told his friends’ parents at 5,hush,I know how to tackle your brats cause I know how to tackle you too don’t be puerile this is Mr Oak(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) then he actually was too harsh on everything that wasn’t of his profession(all laugh) which was that he had to know about everything gross possible of pokemons but he was very sweet in the core exactly why Lillie is just that as you see now hence the vultures that didn’t is nowhere near them hence only Gili is so happy(all laugh) with Darkramar(all laugh) thus actually I went to Shamrockmoss to meet grandpa was in his very last days here this terms in objective worlds but I’m so happy that he too saw Mehu there(all laugh) I told from before that I’ll go there with my best friend and Grandpa surely knew that it’s just his granddaughter-in-law cause I told him in privacy that I have no problem if she doesn’t have any to remain best friends so yeah we will like to be like this yeah(all laugh)..so.),yeah I’m happy at that as grandpa just smiled and said best wishes as was Pidgeot then(all laugh) but not anymore though now breeded twice then returned said why bother if you’ve yourself grown up now(all burst into laughter) thus he has been WOKEN(all laugh) so this is about our family and same for Mehu’s parents my mom and dad there,much well known gym leaders the gym itself has history and all so these are learnt by me as you know I smell AH!History!(all laugh)’,now this means my mom and dad here must absolutely be brought out of mind cause these discussions were in front of dad so they too must be present(all laugh) so the venerables now cease us again(all laugh)..and he continues,’my mom and dad in-law about them the gym has HISTORY(all laugh) and of course Daisy knows everything was 16 years then,old enough then itself and Violet the same though not that old at 14(all burst into laughter,Daisy and Violet both uncontrollably laugh) so then about them well mom went out 16 to 20 Kanto,Kalos,Sinnoh and Pasio and grandpa there was gym leader mom was single child so despite her other talents had to take over the gym as soon as she could(all laugh) returned took over the gym both she and grandpa was as good as Lillie was at her best(all laugh) just that Lillie wasn’t full time(all laugh) but my mom and Lillie both due to other talents and INGRAINED PROPENSITIES wasn’t as focused as Mehu is on battling and gym managing not gym leading that is(all burst into laughter) the perfect gym leader is the one who can manage everything the outside hazards as well like what uncle can or Sabrina can but Mr Oscar Slate can’t do as well(all laugh) hence he needs his his wife Flores then same for Hamish as you know Mr Bruno’s son know him since 15 his wife since 22 they are too sweet and naive(all laugh) hence only both function a a unit and also for the reasons Mehu needs her husband and thus mom too needed dad and Daisy is very similar to mom in most respects including this but Trace due to his too nice nature and knowing the same in Daisy discouraged Daisy(all burst into laughter,Daisy and Tracey uncontrollbaly laugh) which is the right thing to do cause Daisy is too gentle to handle recovery from bruises but not they themselves(all burst into laughter) hence the bruises would’ve taken over hence she would’ve had to quit it(all laugh) anyway,so at 22 mom there met dad who was out of profession without any brats fortunately(all laugh) and was the gym official head the post Sarah as at now Brauch has been there for long though(all laugh),Brauch now is 63 and dad would’ve been 77 so yeah 14 years younger to dad(all laugh) and Brauch joined at the age of 35 himself and thus 28 years back and dad was still alive then,next year went into abstraction and then dad couldn’t continue the office works for last 2 years of his illness and then next two also another two persons did then Sarah came in when mom was 46 and herself wasn’t well and with the gym etc and this was also the year before mom too followed dad into abstraction and so Sarah also is out of profession totally and then was 36 and thus she is 60 now(all laugh)..yeah,whole thing will be said as you know(all laugh)..then Laurent their first son was born when Brauch was 28 and then Victor when he was 31 and hence when Victor and Laurent came in the gym they were 10 and 7 respectively,Laurent is out of profession and Victor stays as you know main referee and very good as well that is(all laugh) in being tickled(all laugh) those dumb buffoons(all laugh) mom was sighing cause this as usual you know how Gengars adore other people too much(all laugh) then says,anyway,Mr George Waterflower was my dad-in-law and Mrs Celia Smith Waterflower was my mom-in-law and so back to them(all laugh)..yeah,even the names were mentioned(all laugh) and I looked at mom she was so angry(all laugh) but the meances to society had gripped her by then(all laugh) I was spared then thankfully(all laugh) but it was harder for me(all laugh) so he realized it and put the pests on me as well(all laugh)..so he continues,and dad was 25 when he accepted the job at Cerulean then and after that when mom was 25 and dad 28 they married and mom was also in the water show and singing etc but it was just as a hobby and then Daisy came here in this psychophysical form(all brust into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) when mom was 28 and Mehu when she was 35 was a good gym but mom and dad both were not of that nature to go head on into something was much gentle in nature mom though not from outside so much but the reality(all burst into laughter) and yeah by the way this gym gym gym I’ve been hearing this word since day 0 here(all laugh) I’ve been to 1377 gyms across the whole world including the obvious(all laugh) and 1377 were hall of fames at my time of visit and I see no difference why one Seaking can’t beat a Kyurem with a cause according to my Kyurem it’s surprizing that it’s not the case in general as both are born(all burst into laughter)..yeah this my bee said cause he doesn’t like the idea that why would people try to contrast my career to the previous(all laugh) cause the present only is all encompassing(all laugh)..anyway,then at 47 dad suddenly went into abstraction suddenly cause {even after a disease for 3 years wasn’t that unwell rather was showing signs of recovery then a sudden unforfotunate heart attack couldn’t take that his body so was in abstraction} and mom still apprised Daisy to complete her travel and then she returned and within 3 months mom also went into abstraction due to a disease but not of that type(all laugh,Gary shakes his head
laughing)..’..yeah my bee said and says exactly these as you know the two venerables say death is a 93/97 abstract 2/1007 potentially gross tickling method(all burst into laughter) so anyway.) he says,yeah then the gym was checked for all sorts of things including health issues cause both were very rare diseases and so on Daisy handled a lot when she was 19-20 sweet little kid that too girl who are more emotional when young especially due to this strange psychophysical existence(all burst into laughter) so annyway.),committee of course didn’t come to any use as usual(all laugh) and this is about the whole picture and yeah about the moments(all laugh) I know a bit Nile’s and Felicia’s are famous in this aspect infact(all laugh) the managers told MetaCozyQuizzyReshi(all brust into laughter) yeah I went to Nile’s with Cozy and Quizzy(all laugh) had some fun they didn’t like the rather serious envioronment though(all laugh) hence Quizzy asked if things can also be confirmed so then why sit and not be ON-THE-FLY(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) and Cozy asked if you’ve come here for certain types of conversations then why are you hungry doesn’t that actually hinder the process especially if the type is rather spicey prolonging to the next morning especially(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing) so they told me in return about mom and dad there(all laugh) but I went in Felicia’s with Metagross and Reshiram(all laugh) after another time with AegiQuizzy(all laugh) Metagross asked if you say it’s a dream then you know it’ll break as well if it’s not with progressing temporality thus why bother at all about the prices and the spices(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and Reshi pointed out that actually when you try to know where you are moment to moment all you do is to see what’s not you thus all the moments you sum up to give you the idea that you’ve moved in the temporal scale but where you don’t know thus is there any need of actions from first sight to the proposal at all(all burst into laughter) where(all laugh) you rather inflict the burden of another to be somewhere around you while you don’t know your own whereabouts yourself thus how can you say you’ll walk together when you don’t know where you’re going thus ask the other thus why bother to take another cause the other is rather hindering you by constantly asking where to be to begin with as being in same situation to even begin that with(all brust into laughter) thus there at Felicia’s I came to know about the rest(all laugh) but I also happen to know about Mr and Mrs Slate(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) and well they both were gym leaders for some times and both are 74 now(all laugh) and yeah ofcourse I also know about uncle and aunt as well(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)..uncle.)..no he even continued that and of course mom was by then dissapointed(all laugh) and I thought if she says yeah food or something despite being at lab(all laugh),you may know that I’m RICH(all laugh) so anyway he continues..so,yeah uncle and aunt met when they were 10(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) and(laugh) then they were in a relationship when they were 13(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) then married at 23 and Gary was here at 26 and actually their plan was to that they will do the career with their child cause that would’ve helped him only cause both were really too devoted in their works so if seriously in would’nt have been bothered so was good but then aunty went into abstraction still uncle went on but then again same thing hence Gary has had only his twin bro to look at(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) but both uncle and aunty later told me,still we met 6 years advance to Gary na na..(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Lillie in tears and fits of laughter  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing)..hmm..(all uncontrollbaly laugh in tears and fits of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah now this lunatic Gyarados has become Seth as well(all laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “and uncle was Mr Oak as well(all laugh) no you know after the conversation with mom added these to me saying a bit more sweetening necessary(all laugh) anyway,then he continued,so uncle and aunty married at 25 and then Gary Oak was born exactly 15 days and 3 hours before me at 04:00 at night on 17th December as Mr Oak(all laugh) doctors told uncle and aunt when they came to know they said,actually we were told,tell my parents the name should be Mr Oak be professional not impetuous kids(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing),thus aunty named him Gary cause that’s that type of Gary which has two edges not of that type(all burst into laughter),well.),this he told me later as well fortunately(all laugh) if at all he did that is being of that type in duality(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs)..then says uncle had only one pokemon a Pidgey(all laugh) sane though(all burst into laughter) and still she evolved into Pidgeoto even in two years mind it human(all laugh) but yeah I understand Marill’s concern both she and her human beau has ears erected that is too much bonhomie(all burst into laughter,Tracey uncotrollably laughs)..and then though he left him at sanctuary we all have seen him and aunty had one Beautifly who also went to sanctuary thus wasn’t insane ever(all laugh) and so on and then the rest you know and thus I know their journey a bit(all laugh) they did only Kanto and so I know that and then Mr and Mrs Slate(all laugh) Mr Flint Slate,Doctor Brock Slate’s dad(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) he is 78 now(all laugh) he travelled through Kanto and Johto for the gym leader post at Pewter and then from 23 actually he travelled for 4 years in total as qualifiers so from 23 to 26 he was gym leader then went on to general training travelled Johto till 29 then again returned to gym leading at 29 and then during his Johto travel met Mrs Zia Raskin Slate who also is 78 now(all laugh) they were travel companions infact she was water gym leader at Yevstar Town,Johto and she too travelled Kanto+Pasio from 17 to 23 then gym leader from 23-25 then went out general training at Johto then again was gym leader from 29 to 29.5 then went to Pewter and married Mr Slate and when both were 30.5 suddenly one day they heard this oracle AH!BEING HUMAN STEELIX!FEELS SO NAIVE!(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) then Doctor Brock Slate was born,then when he was 30.5 Mr Slate then he went out again to Kanto as trainer and was there for 2.5 years and then when he was 36.75(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing),Doctor Edmond Slate was born then Mr Oscar Slate was born when they were 41 and he’s the current gym leader there and both he and Edmond was taken to Yvester again when aunty was 44 and she stayed there till 46 for a couple of years was gym leader and thus Oscar and Edmond has stayed there at Yvester from 3-5 and 8-10 years of age respectively and then she was 48 Mrs Gemma Slate Lirtibar was born and then she returned to gym leading at Yevstar again from then from 51-53 then again from 59-60 before handing the gym over completely to her relatives and thus she has been a gym leader for total 7 years but you see these gaps,their nature and that of Brock are why I was interested(all laugh),then Gemma stayed at Yvester with her from 5-7 actually,only Brock has ever only stayed at Pewter and Brock became leader and then you know went out with us and then he too returned for 6 months again after our Kanto journey finished and then these 3 gaps barring the last were because Mr and Mrs Slate couldn’t come in terms with their career pursuits,married life,responsibility sharing and so on but this is like if you assume my and Mehu’s case in the 5 year break-up time and the intensity is decreased to the level of not staying together and not talking 7 days a week but 2(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing),this actually was also Yevstar to Pewter distance that is a bit long but it takes for my travel alone now 48 minutes door-to-door(all laugh) but me and Mehu stayed at that speed 2:25 hours apart(all laugh) and then my dragons couldn’t travel as fast so that was another thing(all laugh) but the thing is that they were ever in contact and so on thus never was the case that it went out of family so it was alright personally a bit strainous(all laugh) and they spoke for may be 1.5 hour each on those two occasions(all laugh) whereas I did the half of that in minutes(all laugh) cause my Tyranitar said it’s wrong ain’t it master brat that you expend a sum when the calls can be incoming only(all laugh) thus I was WOKEN(all laugh) and now(laugh) he went on to talk about all the pwans for Doctor Slate of all people(all laugh) and then(laugh) hopefully after mom left but I couldn’t he dragged mom and dad in it(all burst into laughter) I just laughed saying why do you want to erase the timescales literally(all laugh) no you know the future needs the database of 100 years(all brust into laughter) the changing of society,systems or may be remaining the same whatever it may be persons work independent of those then society works independent of persons and then there’s the link in-bwteen but the idea of society is constant as is that of a person and their ideas of each other all are constant and not me yet I play here all are my so you see Gengleye,this idea so much it tickles then the pests said,feel it master brat by not feeling cause AH!so maddening(all brust into laughter) I barely could stay alive just at the prelude(all laugh) then anyway,goes on about mom and said in this language in brief,a few brats roamed around but grandpa was there so was easier for mom to get a grip over her multifaceted talent and so she was ok after just one year but then Grandpa went into abstraction next year when mom was gym leading for 2 and grandma wasn’t present out of subtlity either since the time when mom was 14 so was a hard time for mom just at 22 and then dad took up the job a year later thus about 10 months time it was very hard for mom cause the official post was barely alright as well and it was from now 50 years back and yeah Cerulean wasn’t what it is now,a name anyway..(all laugh) but was on the way to become what they are now a terriblly deluded place(all laugh) so thus with mom’s talents and age of that type(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) it was hard for her the situation then dad came along and all were fine from the next year when she was 23 and dad was 26 then they were there for two years at the gym working to a stability and then at 25 and 28 respectively married and then the gym was fine but Yellowburst was a hall of fame gym then as you know with Mr Bronckhorst,Brawn’s maternal uncle was a huge name indeed it was mythical in Kanto-Johto-Pasio region and Sinnoh and Hoenn too and even Unova cause he was 85% holder in specialist electric training had a Zekrom and yeah Zeraora,Xurkitree,Raikou,Zapdos,Thundurus,Tapu Koko all the electric pseudo-legends,I saw a very few of his bunch on my first visit there now only 2 survives a Ampharos and the Thundurus his own both very very old now about 100 years both around thus will be only in next term get WOKEN(all laugh) but given how good they have been trained this term definitely will else where’s progress of the awakening not birth(all laugh) then I asked my bee how do you know things 50 years old(all laugh) said no the gym has HISTORY(all laugh) said I pushed this and that person with the obvious GitiLatiQuizzyCozy(all laugh) so they told me(all laugh) yeah a most evolved Latios inside your bedroom is something not appreciated by people at all(all laugh) anyway then said Peral’s former managers AH!so endearing(all burst into laughter) with AegiQuizzy(all burst into laughter) Aegislash asked them how can you be happy with another when the person wants the same from you thus it’s a logical chain of fruitless duality ain’t it(all brust into laughter) and Quizzy asked them how do you know someone is your beau unless you ask them to define that to match your demands of the definition moment to moment that is mentally though(all brust into laughter) so yeah it was refresheing(all laugh) and yeah Mr Fey,Mrs Olman etc as well(all laugh) anyway then goes on ofcourse still but this time while back to mom(all laugh),so says then Doctor Brock Slate met the Gardilivion gym leader on the fly when he was Mr Brock Slate still(all laugh) this was during his Johto travels and this was at 18 they both were and then were in a relation which was forced upon Brock when he was 19(all laugh) but he being naive just was so thus it dragged on for 4 years(all laugh) but the reality was that before this Brock and Violet met at 24 Brock,23 Violet that age you know that feeling(all brust into laughter,Brock and Violet uncontrollbaly laugh) then that Gardilivion chapter happened later,Brock barely cared just with his nature tolerated thought will churn out once the time is of that type cause the being was not of that type(all laugh a lot,Gary shakes his head laughing) and he took a bit of time to warm up to Violet actually(all laugh) who tried to devour him first sight as well(all laugh) but slowly letting it boil more unlike Mehu(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) anyway,then the Gardilivion chapter ended when Brock was 23 and then his relationship started in reality formally that is(all laugh) with Violet and they were ready to get married when they were 25 again just the officiality(all laugh) cause both since 20 were behaving like spouses which they called a good and progressive collboration(all laugh) the Gardilivion chapter was just tolerating unnecessary hazards but yeah there too the illusion broke off rather sooner and the persons are fine now with other persons nothing of any bitterness remains and has remained for the last 19 years for sure atleast thus is ok and about Violet we all know too well(all laugh) she is too straight and nice a person as Mantine is(all laugh) so actually she is very unique given the profession she was at still nothing all rather feared her expressive outbrusts if the limit crossed of her tolerance and Brock included knows it yeah(all laugh) but about Brock and Violet well,Brock went out with us at 23 and Violet from 26 started her expansive travelling(all burst into laughter) Violet returned to Yellowburst at the age of 37 and you know her career being at this lab makes even Interregionally famous stars too intriguing to public(all laugh) and no she has done infinitely much with her grasp at literature and philosophy etc and mostly with her unique personality which is essential for our translators as you see the two soulmates of mine here would’ve been otherwise unable to share their researches on holisitic psychology of cognition with us(all burst into laughter) on level terms to get us more interested about their fundings for future research that is all mental though(all burst into laughter)anyway, then Violet married Brock at 39 so they had similar kind of situation for 16 long years(all laugh) but here I must say I didn’t do my service to any of my elder sisters being the first one to enter their family as in-law illegally at 17(all burst into laughter) no Mehu was a sweet little kid,I was cunning enough a pro(all laugh) so took this opportunity(all burst into laughter) thus all of them unnecessary was much pained cause my two bros here are too gentle to force anything(all burst into laughter) so I reviewed them as well especially Gary in most possible details that is ever the most ENTHRALLING(all burst into laughter)..” Gary(laugh) : “man,I’ve been cursed since day 0 Sabrina atleast had the freedom for 26 years(all laugh) mom and dad and my parents there at gym and uncle ALL KNEW THIS PEST WILL COME SO BOOKED THE SAFEST SEAT(all laugh)” Tracey(laugh) : “and I should’ve listened to dad and Hect you know after all they were right by every means(all laugh)” Brock(laugh) : “just should’ve killed these two pests off in jungle and smuggled the bodies along with their twin(all laugh) would’ve still returned to discuss philosophy and Corsola but horrendously of vulturology(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “ARTICUNO(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) but why is my side mumb(all laugh)” Violet(laugh) : “waiting to smuggle to Boulder(all burst into laughter)” Daisy(laugh) : “well,only such pests could tell me before the operation in that situation that I’ve eavesdropped your life(all laugh) and then send me back with ghosts to protect me by making me insane(all laugh)” Lillie(laugh) : “and I was on-the-fly(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “then my bee told about you all(all laugh) it was brief and like this,Trace went to gym and Daisy was there day one they at first sight realized are here only to help each other realize the relity of their beings behind their idea of being hence went along(all laugh) and same for Brock and Violet and yeah Violet met Brock when she was 21,hence Mehu was 15 thus a year before we went to Pewter at 16(all burst into laughter) but she didn’t know it then neither did Brock tell us before visiting Cerulean itself being a city anyway(all laugh) no still says you know godforsaken place this damn gym(all laugh) but if my sweet bee is the leader here we are getting heritage destination status in a month(all laugh)..well I’ve seen that side of him that none of you namecalls have(all laugh)..no during both the breaks I said I don’t want to battle,half sharing always hum(all laugh)..so.) was in then he always did the first half and could do that cause he was using Dase’s bunch not even mine due to too much bonhomie(all laugh) it was possible we just said .sin(all laugh) then he never used Gyarados though(all laugh)...**(gym leading)


then first match a challenger comes a 5 time champ(all laugh) this was during Frontier actually so we had a reputation by then hence many champs came in and was 5 time champ in his 8th region at Frontier so very serious(all laugh),now my bee didn’t know what to say during the talks and all so Sarah managed I couldn’t cause was behind the curtains..so.),that goes then he is very surprized to know who is filling in cause was scared(all laugh) then my bee first releases Dase’s Kyurem(all laugh),against Naganadel(all laugh),that was his 6th region won(all laugh) so anyway then it starts and now Kiurie can’t be Kurrie who was at college still then(all laugh)..so then the match starts and then I actually wondered that how would he fare cause I first hand knew that his brats aren’t exactly normal no matter his methods certainly Muk,Abomie,Snorlie,Bannie and Ferali most certainly wasn’t(all laugh) just as the rest(all laugh) infact I even when he left for Unova 2 thought that only Chu was normal despite my experiences with him first night(all laugh) just thought that well papers say he’s the only one left that is able to battle as my bee himself said(all laugh) so yeah definitely the wait paid most endearingly off the 9 months experience(all laugh) and that brat doesn’t want to even move an inch now like his 2nd compeer Pidgey what to speak of breaking sweat(all laugh) but he wisely enlighten people of his experiences of sweating that is always poor kids from 11 city circles(all laugh) so anyway then Kiurie starts attacking first(all laugh)..and all were too obvious ofcourse only ice beam after ice beam(all laugh) so gets in trouble seriously in quick time now starts the counter(all laugh) so now Kiurie has met him so few times then only one week before was constant when Dase still was there desperate to keep her brats sane thus adorable(all laugh) well not only her aim but also her jackal’s too who added humanity with it(all laugh)..anyway then I was wondering well this is suicidal stuff(all laugh) I knew if it were say Godly he would’ve drawn the next round too no matter who(all laugh) so I was curious now what he does and no I have much ideas on what sort of questions his own brats will come up with which still will make sure I lose cause the more I try to be engaging they will try to prolong it and they have no limits at all till the despondency of sanity falls(all laugh) hence I’ll become a brat too if I try too hard(all laugh)..so.),he would’ve taken nearabout same approach with my brats and could’ve won still certainly with Goldy and Jelli definitely(all laugh) and my pseudo-legends won’t work like that but other brats like Poli,Clottie and Tentie most certainly will(all laugh) and no fortunately for me Dhemie and Rotom was used to much(all laugh) but I couldn’t use Jelli anywhere except psychic and water cups his normal types and Dhemie was used each match at grass cups and gyms(all laugh) so was spoiled hence immune to my bee(all laugh)..so.) then he gets cornered and his face still all the same absolutely zero emotions and now Naganadel starts to attack from all suqares so Kiurie now has to defend even for that may be she didn’t have enough left with all those ice beams(all laugh) so now my bee shows why he was waiting for this long,Kiurie starts defending by asking I had a translator connected to my bee’s who actually asked me before getting into the match how do you remain unattached of it and read the original versions cause I can’t recall the last time I used one(all laugh) so I said just remember the jackal’s match(all laugh),by the way when the jackal came in to polish the bottom of my boots as I first started(all laugh),I compelled him to battle me with Venonat(all laugh),and make him attack me first,I was using Slowking a DISTINCT disadvantage(all laugh a lot,Tracey shakes his head laughing),now jackal says,um..yeah Vintie what was that attack that we


then that’s a draw so I went more Gyaradosy(all laugh) then next in is Lil’s Blastoise(all laugh),against(laugh),Milotic(all burst into laughter)


now I was thinking no way this can happen but it does and it’s a draw after 54 damn minutes(all laugh)?


then comes Dase’s Regice(all laugh),the one she couldn’t physically fondle along with Kiurie hence was sane enough still(all laugh)?


now it’s a draw still after 61 minutes(all laugh)..and I was like just erupted and barely managed not to get out and get caught(all laugh)?


anyway then asks the ref is the opponent worthy of the badge cause man I sure do with my performance that’s all of my badges till now(all laugh),so then hands him the badge with a big hug who was just a statue being too starstuck(all laugh)..so then had a chat finally privately(all laugh) then next half I said please Seth once more(all laugh) and you know my bee is never going to say no to that one(all laugh),so next half again as luck would have it another champ this time only one but was in her last region again from Unova(all laugh) and was the league champ there itself at her 4th(all laugh) so was in her 40s married and had a child as well didn’t take the little kid thankfully otherwise my bee would’ve made her role model for gym challengers to unmarried or new married for 25 years now 42 female gym brats like his flower(all laugh)..so.) then she goes with Salamence(all laugh) this was against my bee’s choise first which was Lil’s Volcanion(all laugh) now this one also I was very interested to see cause he already had exhausted may be the only three he could use from two of his elder sister’s bunches(all laugh) anyway Volly was fondled too much lately so was hard for him(all laugh) but now the opponent is good but obviously not upto the level of the first challenger yet manages to sneak past Volly despite similar tactics from his bro master(all laugh)..now my bee laughs and goes with Dase’s Dewgong finally(all laugh) who was secured via Crawdauntogating(all laugh)..so now also the challenger Tina her name was I guess anyway she changes and sets in Latios(all laugh),now this one somehow is a draw(all laugh),so now he has only one brat left to two dragons obviously(all laugh),so now goes Lil’s Rotom finally(all laugh) so the result was known before no matter look-only-at(all laugh) but yeah now she’s being taught special lessons at 235 conferences(all laugh) espcially at late night(all laugh) anyway then Ritie is up against Dragonite(all laugh a lot) and somehow beats him(all laugh),now I was like how can this happen now and Tina was just laughing as was my bee then both saluted each other then comes Salamence again(all laugh),now Salamence gets it and just overpowered Rittie in like one second(all laugh) so now certainly my bee gives the badge and and praises Tina to all heavens(all laugh) and she was as well just too awestruck with everything anyway then aftermatch bro tells me laughing,see pokemon trainer actually means only able to train certain pokemons not others which I don’t like at all this difference of my views to myself of myself(all laugh),I said man even I can’t believe what I saw throughout the day says,yeah combinatory tickling(all laugh)..


anyway then continued,and Lillie and Gary all of whom I happen to know first hand(all laugh) but again reviewed it cause both they and me were teenagers(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing),Gary met Lillie possibly when I was at Yellowburst Forest or may be exactly the day on which I met Mehu,at Cerulean first I went into the challenger centre where Violet noted that my dress wasn’t suitable which she asked Brock to confirm(all laugh) then only came to know they know each other hence married for like ages cause they got engaged and forgot my presence(all laugh) this I tell you along with the Gardilivion stuff cause you realize why that was illusion cause Brock and Violet were too free with each other which appeared to me spontaneously as my Squirtle says as you know the one not the other thus you’re one hence who’s the other(all laugh) so you see I was cunning enough a pro even then(all laugh) then Daisy was the guide there I knew her name asked but you’re the gym leader(all laugh) said no my 3rd youngest sis is here just two months back finished her journey will be battling you but why her younger sis hasn’t called her or her eldest sis for a week now(all laugh) and isn’t here(all laugh) then I realized with three sisters all scattered across only 4 year span(all burst into laughter) and then given their unique talents and personalities and then the show this gym will have some beautiful times(all laugh) so I booked the youngest situated 5 years below at earliest(all burst into laughter) cause there was a song Brock and Gary heard respectively 7 years and 15 days 3 hours before me(all burst into laughter) but Trace took his customery observation time as he realized that burden is most at the bottom of structure the general view is actually upended temporally that is(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..now(laugh),the pests were forcefully on us so that we get more agitated(all
laugh) so says,the song is(all burst into laughter),in this tone goes, Sisters sisters Sisters sisters(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Seth uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits of laughter  ehadi) There were never such devoted sisters(all burst into laughter) Never will I tolerate a chaperon(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) Thus I will only contact in calls all the time but have to gauge so only at wrong times(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) Ever will I want a specifically balanced man to peek at through my wigs(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) So I’m here to check the pokemons while keeping my eye moving around for you but only ON-THE-FLY(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) Sharing,Caring among ourselves only who are sweet best friends thus we’re nearing(all burst into laughter) and caring also about every little thing that Gyarados is wearing in front of you(all burst into laughter) I want to ever be the nice and gentle one exactly when a certain gentle man named Mr Fox arrived for his sit tracing the right bush to pass across the years of all his scorching days in delight and rest(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing)…
then pests were a bit easy on us so mom was visiblly seething with anger(all laugh) so my bee in even more glee goes, hence you see I’m vulgar(all laugh) but anyway,then Lillie was told to face me but she REVOLTED(all laugh) then was scoffed off in front me by Daisy(all laugh) which again is cause it was family skirmish stuff(all laugh) cause they knew I’ve abducted their baby sis mentally that is(all burst into laughter) and they also knew that I was enough a pro to be participating in () (all brust into laughter)..now at this mom was extremely angry so the pests tickled us mentally more(all laugh)..then says my hubby pro(all laugh),it is because they just after registration called me and tried to show me that Mehu is their sis but not my sweet wife(all laugh)..exactly the mistake Gary made when he forgot that Gili is my nephew as well as was Lillie my sis surely I could swear my dear sweet big sis suspecting her character couldn’t I what I did that day at lab(all laugh)..now mom was very angry so the pests were off(all laugh)..mom says,yeah congratulations for CROSSING EVERY POSSIBLE LIMITS(all laugh),rhymes with Raftosmoric whose that pokemon(all laugh)..this is cause the pests were back on then(all laugh)..then he says no mom it’s ok only they were present and it was laughed off withing 12 hours itself as you know but you didn’t know why Gary of all pros(all laugh) wasn’t steady that day(all laugh)..anyway thus when they called me saying my dream of abducting their baby sis isn’t materializing as they have already informed the police I only said rhymes with Gorebyss whose that pokemon(all brust into laughter)..so then they said we are informing your mom,I said rhymes with Lickitung whose that pokemon(all burst into laughter)..so then they told Mehu to forsake me(all laugh)..so.) Mehu said you buffoons(all laugh) THIS IS A TRAP TO DESIST A TRAVEL COMPANION WHO THINKS HE IS APPEARNING AS A BOY TO HER EXACTLY WHY SHE HAS BECOME NOT HIM BUT HER(all burst into laughter)..so they finally became sisters rather than sinisters(all laugh) and after this within week Lillie met Gary as well so we both were cunning(all laugh)..anyway thus when I went to Cerulean they didn’t behave like official gym leaders at all that day but why(all laugh) should’ve been opposite which I’ll do to Blasie or Jas for sure unless they are at Venturiastrog as you know(all laugh) where Trace proposed Marill(all laugh) anyway about Gary,Lillie only said hearing my hometown the umpteenth time(all laugh) that a certain trainer was from there who was of my age and was way way more skillful and even more gracious(all laugh) I realized from her disposition that for someone who was in the profession for may be 2 weeks then(all laugh) first not many would’ve been from Pallet first then would’nt have been a 7 league champ from Pallet cause her eldest sis was there hence only beginners thus this disposition means as Gengleye say the first realization from being to being to being to self tickling(all burst into laughter) thus she was so happy(all laugh) and I asked was it his first badge said yeah then I asked her did he introduce himself as Mr Oak(all laugh) it’s cause I already knew it from the devil himself(all laugh) anyway,Lillie just laughed and said are you a detective in teenage disguise(all laugh) she herself had been a teeager only a couple of months ago though(all laugh) but was trying to show as if a grand old Veanasaur(all laugh) which her youngest sis tried to play later twice(all laugh) but as she was my wife since before we came here so I abjectly sweetened her both times saying ‘attitude?’(all laugh)..this.) as I said I told mom before and then this was said to me cause realized how much I’m laughing thus signalled that I’ll hug you to death in front of mom later give up this sanity of attitude(all laugh) anyway then says,so I just gravely burshed Lillie aside saying,this you see is to get into further clarification of my doubts(all laugh) so I said no met us two days back and actually is Professor Oak’s grandson always interested about researches more just trying to figure out what to do but very determined person know him from my birth almost just have grown up together and he was returning to the lab so Mehadi actually said yeah I’ll have a look at the lab as well my sister’s Relicanth is there now my good pal(all laugh) when you finish Cerulean tell me I’ll catch up with you so I said yeah alright then I informed Professor so that’s why Mehadi isn’t here will be coming tomorrow late(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) so you see I was cunning enough a pro even at 17 veiling density(all laugh) now mom was disappointed(all laugh) says,sorry for language AGAIN(all laugh) but this is what gives it the funnier coat which is why our translators are so great no wonder our Viol flower is such a successful sinister in expressive cooking of appearing genderhood(all brust into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) anyway,so you see first it proves I don’t cherish Mehu at all(all laugh) second I don’t cherish Gary at all either(all laugh) who is my childhood crush looked too steady ON-THE-FLY(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Seth cheers for now you’re called DR OAK! But why is it now you’re called oh my sweetie Oak,all uncontrollably laugh,tears,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing) but you may know my Palkia supports this behaviour of mine(all burst into laughter) he says till or after you know the truth or lie the absolute continue to not know it(all burst into laughter) Brock was told by me and threatened by Mehu in similar lines as well not to tell her whereabouts as she was at Meuseam only(all laugh) and yeah my Butterfree was with her as protection still(all laugh) so this I fed Lillie cause Palkian life I first read at 9 realized when I was 14 since then it has changed my life that spark(all laugh) AH!so ENLIGHTENING(all laugh) now I saw the change in her complexion so it meant either she is angry that I’ve abducted her baby sis which was implausible cause we were registered thus such things meant huge trouble(all laugh) and then my whole bio-data was with them and was checked by Elite4 then I wouldn’t have been foolish enough to come at her home to inform her family of my deeds(all laugh) which were true but mental that is(all laugh) so it meant she was angry at Mehu’s frivolous attitude but that wasn’t possible cause this nature was what Lillie herself showed to the whole world to conceal her ever sweet little girl nature that we’re seeing now no more concealed
yeah you can say she is 43 not 20 now(all burst into laughter) but then again as my bunch says 20,43 or 43210(all laugh) it doesn’t matter cause at any age you want to be older or younger cause you’re not age just the urge for or to the expereinces more or less is the age in illusion you don’t change as says my Oxy(all burst into laughter) who was the one to vehemently oppose all those that said why 3 years and 11 months and then still another week of difference(all brust into laughter,Lillie and Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh,Tracey and Gary shakes their heads laughing)..on another case the subject was upended hence sweetened IN THOSE FEELINGS(all brust into laughter,Brock and Violet uncontrollbaly laugh)..anyway thus if Mehu followed suit she would’ve been happy that she too realizes the importance of concealing her own too sweet nature(all laugh) so you see neither do I have any love and respect for my elder sis nor do I cherish Mehu so definitely atleast at some point of time I’ve been a Playboy(all laugh) then mom looked extremely dissapointed(all laugh) then this obviously cheers my cunningly dense hubby even more so he says,so then it only meant she was mentally tickled by her thoughts on the thoughts that she really had thought that Mr Oak was in her thoughts all along(all laugh) yeah this is exactly why I say Nivy is so sweet(all laugh) so then I proceeded to counter her off the match totally cause she was already trapped by unemployment notice hallucinations now is thrown to be thrown off as the economic depression newses air(All burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) she said nothing so I said,but yeah I recalled also my friend Millie(all burst into laugher,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) also told will come here after Yellowburst she got a Sandslash and a Bastiodon so went there first has she too visited haven’t talked with her for some days now(all laugh)then she said no and solemnly asked me how many brats(all laugh) I realized I’ll lose the match get humiliated but I can also pester Mr Oak on his future that is(all laugh) so Lillie realized I also had upper hands on her(all laugh) thus was serious so it meant she really like Mr Oak thus wants to show him how great she is in battles which meant she lost the match which meant was to be treated as little sis by Mr Oak which didn’t happen thus it meant Mr Oak too likes her(all burst into laughter) hence my Crawdauntogator redistributes the distributed plans each moment(all laugh)so I said three brats so far one kept with Mehu sorry Mehadi(all laugh)..now this was to mean that Mr Oak was in quicksand(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing)..so she was extremely angry and just said alright select your starter against my Ninetails her toughest brat(all laugh) Gary got Volcanion who is craziest(all laugh) so I released Guzzlord(all burst into laughter) why what’s wrong it’s 2-1 down on types(all laugh a lot)


got into the match but before that also another logical chain I realized that Brock didn’t tell us about Violet nor did she pay any attention to me who has abducted her baby sis and die hard fan since 10(all laugh) so it meant they aren’t getting inside the gym today atleast cause when your family doesn’t know your future spouse the journeys are rather more enjoyable(all burst into laughter,Brock and Violet uncontrollbaly laugh) so Lillie couldn’t verify my words at all and no Brock if heard this story of mine would’ve got multiple edge counters first I realized he wants me to marry Mehu next moment(all laugh) but I told him just the gender(all burst into laughter) then he would’ve been happy at my acts and then if he told the truth first then it meant I really am a cunning pro(all
laugh) thus her sisters would’ve tried to hinder Mehu from coming with me thus I knew her attitude again to me(all laugh) thus she would’ve REVOLTED(all laugh) and then if she did she would’ve realized I was enjoying our companionship rather so would’ve confessed her longing for me herself which she always does herself just needs that type of a spark(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) then it would’ve meant I was the winner by every means cause then Gary and Lillie’s secret would’ve been out too to Mehu(all laugh) cause she knew Gary as well as I did know
about her elder sisters especially her Lilliellery(all laugh) thus both would’ve linked them up(all laugh) which I would’ve done anyway(all laugh) then anyway Lillie was about to chew me up so I fed her Pidgeot(all laugh) she was laughing but the trouble was that Pidgeot was pestering her not Volcanion as according to his plans not mine(all burst into laughter) he even then asked Lillie if you want to battle the weak how can you know who is weaker(all brust into laughter)..so Lillie just lost it with all insinuations and now this humiliation so sweet my little big sis(all laugh) so this to her meant Gary has already confessed his longing for her to the whole world(all laugh) hence she was very irritated and complained to the whole world that my brats aren’t at all tamed,I’m making fun of my travel companion’s sisters cause she is infatuated with me and so on(all laugh) so Daisy was very angry with all this(all laugh) on Lillie though for not being able to act as a pet should’ve(all laugh) and on me too as usual so decilous the food this whole Cerulean dish hence said my Chu(all laugh)..so.) then Lillie said all cause they don’t put up boards in the Forest that Rimsable is the other way(all laugh) then Brock came along with Violet who supported me saying these are the exact textbook greatest caring husband relation with elder sis-in-law(all laugh) and she was 24 herself just got out of university stood first there in region-WIDE exams(all burst into laughter,Brock and Violet uncontrollably laugh) but still she took two extra years to finish both degrees being steady despite her electrifying flight(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) so you see playing Lillie in my favour or Violet against all is so easy(all laugh) but Daisy isn’t easy at all as said Mehadi(all laugh) but then there is a jackal which calls at dusk but then doesn’t call till around dawn(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh) so you see my big sisters then thought they were grown up adults but in reality they were nothing to BEAUTY(all burst into laughter),so anyway.),then all talk and all then I told them about Gary’s steadiness and so on(all laugh) then they realized I was jealous of his brats(all laugh) so then Mehu came and had our battle with her Staryu and Starmie against my Butterfree and Pidgeot,Butterfree beat Staryu and Starmie beat Butterfree then Pidgeot beat Starmie too but she said 3 on three and though Chu never battles Mehu as you know but that was the day I first found this out that he is really my big bro(all laugh) and sadly her too though sad cause of his current and real thus permanent form the most ENCOMPASSING(all laugh) then before that Team Rocket intervened at evening and so on then we passed the night there next day afternoon was out and Mehu was so sweet when she was at the opposing platform(all laugh)..anyway.),this was my way to know about Mr Oak and Mr and Mrs Oak(all laugh) but before this you now Gary’s career as an intellectually sturdy pro of steady school(all burst into laughter) he never cared about anything except family and extended family and pokemons and wanted to be professional cause his nature is that with his personal life he is at bay cause his love and affection is all devouring a nice gentle Unown(all laugh) this nature I can tell you Olivia has most similarity with as you know her and Tony who’s no more a boy though I call him so still and will 42 years later as well(all laugh) anyway,then Gary’s travel companions weren’t of any use to him and so on till he met Marc the Mr Litman(all laugh) but before that he met Lillie his soulmate and anyway then both were too young just had good contacts but that incindent then happened when he was 18 just after he returned from Kanto all 20 years back and that opened his eyes as to he became firmly established in the professional life and just was happy with family previously was trying to show off a bit of his knowledge only so that they leave his personal life out and at the same time with that age helping others in the jealousy tricks sneaked into him from 13 to 14.5(all laugh) anyway,all those were off by 16 itself and this incident made him Mr Oak at 18(all laugh)..then most brutally for all of you my bee went on to thankfully to only me though went on to detail each traditions or just general ones he alone and you all have had before the eventual with intricate reasons and rigourous proofs of vulturology(all brust into laughter,Seth uncontrollbaly laughs  ehadi,Mehadi laughs a lot)..”
Gary(laugh) : “THIS BRAT HAS PUT A COVER ON OUR LIVES(all laugh)..” Lillie(laugh) : “yeah I was told these directly the day he told me that he had eavesdropped my life(all laugh)..man I was taken aback at first says well one feels refreshed coming out of washroom always why bother(all brust into laughter)” Daisy(laugh) : “and I was told don’t bother none knows the process before it begins how can you be faithful before you’re so(all burst into laughter)” Tracey(laugh) : “yeah but still none of you atleast faced the vulture killer(all laugh) that hideous curse told me(all laugh) during undercover I’ve had the opportunity to sample mixtures proportionately though(all brust into laughter) but I found that in my mind the vultures(all laugh) didn’t get a hold onto things Trace it was the first of that kind to both you two and your 2nd youngest bro and sis too despite the fact that none knew before what it is Trace how can that lead to happiness unless you knew it from before Trace how can you ever be single by trying(all brust into laughter)” Brock(laugh) : “man this pest abducted me to Yellowburst at midnight(all laugh) and there itself said in front of my sis-in-law,a mosquito bit my cheek I hit it but then the colour..aww..(all brust into laughter)..even Mehadi was too shocked(all laugh) comes PalkiaRem and hallucinates which this brat explains to his wife as just Dark Night: a sustainable reference to optimizable tickling(all brust into laughter)..thankfully I atleast learnt how to battle unlike Trace hence got a politer version(all laugh)..” Violet(laugh) : “and later Flores told me to her of all people directly said right after marrying his eternal Mehu flower once more that you see our sis Violet is the best example on the manipulations of extremist surges to expressive empire that enlightens the emotinally deprived yet metaphysically euphorized(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) as said my Noivern master brat your age enlightens the thoughts of yours not you discern yourself never the illusive ideas that beau(all brust into laughter)..Flores said during Unova that sis how can he survive if a Dispoptas whims to blast his Sceptile(all laugh),I said well as much as I realize both the two brats will ask may be so that we’re no more here last/but that means the wheel once more turns only brother how can you get out of being you by just planting the GRASS(all brust into laughter)..Flores said yeah I understand now why Volcarona defeated Giratina rhymes with Sabrina whose that pokemon(all brust into laughter)..Sabrina we all pestered then with this said yeah the grand luck of being the biggest sister to these in-born little brats(all laugh)..and she ever said had I not complied that brat Haunter would’ve made me literally so(all laugh)..no wonder Mehu flower has forever been too infatuated(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “well my bee asked me the day he was to go to Cerulean that look it’s run by women how can I go there and expect to win,thinking of myself as a not not woman(all brust into laughter)..so I somehow said it’s alright they won’t ask you this(all laugh)..anyway.) then back to his dicourse to mom,then about Gary he says,Gary returned here after Kanto and then setteled into reality then he was studying then I returned from Pasio and hence he too wanted to travel one region more so went out to Johto and got Tyranitar(all laugh) he was as a good as anyone in training has a grand bunch as you know but this wasn’t his area so that skill didn’t have the backing of interest so wasn’t persistent but that skill only has helped him in his career and he was a bit egotistical till 16(all laugh) that went away as he was out all alone this time at Rainblue(all laugh) and then met a few great gym leaders and trainers and professionals and so on like a certain Mr Marc Litman to begin with(all laugh) he is Unova Elite4 head so you realize I know him and will more so(all laugh) a grand man though single still morally very high battle geek and lunatic extreme skills but is suspicious of everyone that doesn’t let him have his ways cause to him they are hindering his freedom of being(all laugh) but he isn’t power hungry just that he is a lunatic battler of a very special kind so these systems don’t suit him at all he would rather spend his entire life in changeroom(all laugh) but that isn’t like McShin sorry Stu sorry Stuart(all laugh) he is power hungry to the absolute maxima hence did what he did by not doing anything to stop brats overthrowing Lance and all but still his skills are skills so respect is ever there and personally is very honest and nice man and very strict infact with his office and all Kanto is actually rethinking now(all laugh) but he is just like that he has to do everything himself and hence is so sweet sweet cause my brats want exactly that(all laugh) but then again these guys including Percy Kalos and ladies group at Hoenn,Johto and Pasio are at one side cause the other side is just sweet sweet Jasu not at all sorry Mr Jason Sinjemar..Jasu..(all laugh) he is a born specialist in suspicion techniques(all laugh) this brat is suspicious of himself(all laugh) hence is most sweetened(all laugh) and Percy you know from Kalos the head there he is very nice a sweet littlle schoolboy of 10/11(all laugh) just about going there(all laugh) but these three of my mates at Unova,Kanto and Sinnoh Elite4 AH!so endearing(all laugh) but then again there’s sweet sweet Ivana from Hoenn and even sweeter Wendy from Pasio(all laugh) one is too solemn for her own liking other exactly opposite for her ownself as well(all laugh) they are like friends of elder sisters whom I know too well thus so captivating the pestering(all laugh) and both their husbands are on my side they the opposite so this current state of my life so enjoying(all laugh) but then again there is the sweetest of them all Mrs Cynthia Marsaft Gomble herself(all laugh) Johto Elite4 head she stays off from al these thus is inactive hence most decilious as a DISH(all laugh) so is pestered twice a week(all laugh) but is scared of all the regions actually(all laugh) cause she doesn’t like to travel(all laugh) actually my troubles are not directly with them except McShin but again as I said he’s so sweetie(all laugh) so it’s ok with him he just tries to hold his own despite knowing he can’t(all laugh) which even Jasu doesn’t(all laugh) but unlike McShin,Jasu suspects any action like drinking a glass of water hence is sweeter(all laugh) it’s with their juniors and seniors most importantly(all laugh) who are not at all nice it’s them who are the troubles cause they brainwash many and actually can compell them you know they are no good at all to themselves hence me and my family and my circle as well hence we REVOLT thus you being my direct family do so too(all laugh) anyway he was saying these and we both realized that the two meances and this sweet Gengar of mine isn’t any different by any means at all(all laugh) anyway then said now Gary since 16 itself became free of all that was hindering him as soon as he saw his soulmate and since then you know him a very famous name now throughout Sinnoh,Hoenn and Kanto if not the whole world and beyond in the legendary worlds and beyond by far by now(all laugh) anyway then back to Lillie(all laugh),Lillie was opposite to Gary her personal life was always fine but professionally she was at bay cause never knew what is to be done with her extreme talents in show business and yet the uniquely too sweet nature that’s exactly similar to Mehu ever allowed her to jump into volcano with Magmorters literally that is(all laugh) and yeah speaking of Magmorters and as I said Gary’s skills as a pokemon general trainer well his Magmorter and Golem may possibly become WOKEN(all laugh) already very very too much intelligent and with my bunch has that material just like his Nidoqueen and Rhyperior as well(all laugh) and Mehu’s Goldy,Jellicent and Gyarados has and a Kyogre too seemed too dissapointed for Mehu’s liking not mine(all laugh) cause he can be awakened too which these too present here and wholeheartedly trying ofcourse(all laugh) and yeah neither my sweet bro nor my sweet sweet wife can help the process cause AH!so maddening that tune(all laugh) and mom looked so dissapointed and yet extremely angry as the pests were laughing now AGAIN(all laugh) then he continues,so yeah Lillie was ever at bay professionally despite her talents so her frivolus character shown through cause she wanted to scoff the pests off by giving them the attitude of unfathomability exactly why she started to wear three wigs per day(all laugh) but she too had only Gary in her mind no matter what she did and actually they didn’t have any contacts direct since 18 to 20 years of Gary and 22 to 24 for Lillie thus(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) then again had the contacts and they proceeded along as if the 2 years never existed and given Lillie’s name and all by then you realize what she is in reality as you see her now exactly the epitome of what her name seems too be too sweet too nice too exuberent no wonder Gary was so infatuated cause at that age of his he thought Lillie wasn’t of his gender(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) I mean(all laugh) that she is not he and thus the lack of any psychophysicality this he couldn’t prove hence was WOKEN ALONE thus not so(all laugh) so this was there and would’ve been all the way even if the environment was hard on her had it been Pewter just not Cerulean a place,anyway(all laugh) but these were the illusions the thing I realized day one I met Lillie was the right hence you’re too happy with your niece-in-law as you see hence I said then itself that that deal with Dave being at home only brings you greater joy hence was a great deal(all laugh) now mom looked very solemn(all laugh) so then my bee feeds off that even more and says(all laugh),then I also on the same day realized about Brock and Violet and then the jackal couldn’t stay unattached to his Dase in any days(all laugh) and that I knew cause the jackal was talking too much about certain pokemons like Caserin and Luverin(all laugh) but these were all before my Hoenn journey all were 16 to 22 years ago last year was totally different(all laugh) last year I used extremely abusive language crucifying Mehu’s character and integrity to the whole world that is for 7 hours(all burst into laughter)..yeah now the psychic healing has to be told cause mom didn’t know the exact reasons for for my treatment then(all laugh) so goes,yeah I accused her of being a playgirl(all laugh) and so on then all the things I could imagine I linked her with or compared(all laugh) I accused her of being the same character she thought I was due to which she broke up and I dragged her whole family and my bros in it to deepen the agony for them and her both(all laugh) cause both sets were at similar bay with the newfound smooth Gengarian view of life hence serious(all burst into laughter) so she was mentally tortured by me to limitless for 7 hours cause she deluded herself becoming Ms Mehadi Waterflower who cherished Seth Ketchum the idea not the reality(all burst into laughter) Mehadi isn’t Mehu and thus Seth Ketchum the reality isn’t her Seth(all laugh) exactly why Trevenant says the ability to see goes if the eyes are closed(all burst into laughter) and I used 132 psychics on her nerves(all laugh) this is psychic healing Trace or Gary would tell you bit by bit about these and Daisy knows a lot now too as well ofcourse had to(all laugh) if you want Mehu herself now knows a lot about them but the best authority on this exact topic as to how it reacts on the body is Trace cause the day after I married Mehu the first morning you may remember Trace was hostaged at my room where I threatened to chop his head off by his own Scyther creating a similar process to heal him from his obsessetion with ideas like destiny,best,forever and perfect(all burst into laughter) hence he realized that he will propose his wife 3 years before later when situation arises just like his Marill(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) anyway,then I used 132 psychics who were(all laugh) at three levels to begin with then were in many levels and combinations I don’t know what exactly they were doing if I did both me and Mehu along with them would’ve been history now(all laugh) due to their inability to read our certain emotions(all laugh) and yeah this whole process was led by Sableye(all burst into laughter) so I used Sableye,Gengar,Hoopa,Greninja,Malamar,Darkrai,Marshadow,Confragigus,Spiritomb and Dusknoir when I began with Bulby and Bayleaf to look after her like sleep powdering her etc Baylie was assisting Bulby who can be a nice doctor as well mental only though via Whimsi(all burst into laughter) anyway,so the whole group then was Bulby was assisted by Baylie and later Whimsi was more prominent(all laugh) and then the 132 psychics overall(all laugh) who were Oricorio,Gengar,Noctowl,Meowstic,Cherruvuemin,Pangoro,Metagross,Chimecho,Wigglytuff,Dhelmise,Marshadow,Celebi,Unown,Claydol,Beeheeyem,Banette,Tyranitar,Solgaleo,Scrafty,Drifblim,Landorus,Jellicent,Gourgeist,Magearna,Sableye,Musharna,Tapu Lele,Jirachi,Gothitelle,Reuniclas,Gardevoir,Shiftree,Bisharp,Weavile,Gallade,Ribombee,Trevenant,Krookodile,Bronzong,Spiritomb,Decidueye,Yveltal,Mismagius,Samurott,Volcanion,Groudon,Drapion,Palossand,Rotom,Uxie,Noivern,Palkia,Goodra,Hoopa,Aegislash,Dialga,Reshiram,Chanedlure,Kyurem,Hydreigon,Confragigus,Zekrom,Meloetta,Guzzlord,Latios,Giratina,Garchomp,Ultranercozma,Mimikyu,Shedinja,Darkrai,Deoxys,Malamar,Dusknoir,Cresselia,Genesect,Zeraora,Zygarde,Heatran,Greninja,Ho-Oh,Moltres,Articuno,Zapdos,Entei,Raikou,Sigilyph,Medicham,Shiinotic,Mewtwo,Lugia,Arceus,Cobalion,Regigigas,Granbull,Kaledo,Zoroark,Regice,Altaria,Suicune,Naganadel,Terrakion,Tryrantum,Thundurus,Blacephalon,Victini and finally Incineroar(all laugh) total 132 still didn’t have to use Crawdaunt(all laugh) and Glalie couldn’t be used and Sharpedo was far out so only Quizzy was left who being only psychic left had to be there to do the zapping works(all laugh) and yeah she vomitted 23 times still(all laugh) now mom was in similar position I guess(all laugh) so pests were tickling us mentally(all burst into laughter) and then he says,Mehu had convulsions and lots of blood while went to washroom and so on all due to the fact that she was using certain illegal substances to forget my memories which she couldn’t normally thus those it’s a form of slow poisoning eventually leads to insanity and then the eventual trasmigration with rather bitterness(all laugh) and she was using them as you know a few may be hence only Lillie screamed at her aunty and Daisy too as would’ve May or Dave or Zara and you know that but on those Mehu added two more extremely dreadful things that were more dangerous and overall were 6+ months on them and was 4/5 months away from the first loss of mind permanent and then 4/5 more to the eventual hence the body revolted against the cure hence all these and also hence I was as brutal as I could imagine on her mentally(all laugh) in the end Crawdaunt was about to be used they themselves were wanting that cause to them on being disparagingly accused of lack of character,Mehu was behaving seriously rather(all burst into laughter) hence they were pushing their own ideas on these issues on her mind(all burst into laughter) and then showing her how to get rid of them all by themselves hence only I was so free thus the heal and my accusion and eventual clarification the date that is went hand in hand simultaneously no other bunch or even person can do that for 7 hours constant saying same words again and again forcing her to submit to reality of her only(all laugh) if other people were there they would’ve been there with an idea of what they can do to cure her which my bunch has got rid of from me(all burst into laughter) so I was rather assured of success(all laugh) then at the end she couldn’t even stand thus Crawdauntogator helped(all laugh) then took her to Marengo to Henry Care as you know then resurant for patients(all burst into laughter) the private cells well almost all are perfect to date in seclusion and calm environment due to the seriousness surrounding the place used in reverse order to advantage our necessity of a nice long date after 5 years rather than general resturants or parks and camps and so on(all brust ito laughter) and Mehu could barely walk there too hence I was  er all the time so sweet my wife(all laugh) this meant he will fondle me to death just after the conversation breaks and mom can go to safety(all laugh) anyway then says,so yeah hence Glalie was kept here that day only to be deported with Mime to take care of Lillie and Daisy cause I questioned their then condition and so on (all laugh) which they thought were devillish on them but as you see they are my family so I was doing only what Luxray tells me moment to moment(all laugh) and yeah I came to know the effects of these and so on cause I’ve been using illegal medicines for like 22 years now(all laugh) since when Pangoro came along(all laugh)..Brock told me this will be hard I said hence only Pangoro wants me to enroll in their best colleges for my higher education away from human emotional garbage of difference like hunger and the lack of it(all burst into laughter) thus I told Brock to fecilitate the entrance their professor is rather happy go lucky outside lecture hall(all burst into laughter) and then I anyway would’ve gone so Brock would’ve been jailed for killing me as Mehu was my witness(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) I told her need to do this cause else I will straight return home with whomever I’ve got so far and enter a philosophy course cause this profession would make no sense to me if I can’t attend great philosophers like Pangoro’s discourse of mask of responsibility on freedom(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) Mehu was terrified by this countering package cause I was her husband even then so Violet was informed as was Mr Slate and thus Brock was under serious pressure(all laugh,Brock shakes his laughing) then Pangoro came first like this tremendus insight into twists and turns of life and their usage(all brust into laughter) then that was 22 years back at Kalos I did things that if known I will be banned immediately now(all laugh) but I did so after telling Percy there only cause thus if I’m banned he will be too(all brust into laughter) in Unova it was Cili(all laugh) and yeah Iris too but she was a trainer as well as you know so I was SECURED(all laugh) and which will ban the whole profession cause my bunch will roam around in Unova with me then in wilderness giving great philosophers their due attention to help them proceed further by means of ethical conversations so enlightening was Guzzlord with his morality of sleep vs dream discourse(all burst into laughter),anyway,so I’ve used many medicines so far legal or illegal at Kalos I could fetch them being already qualified to get hall of fame and so on and had to cause my travel companions there weren’t in this profession as you know Clemont is still very much then wasn’t decided and then he’s an engineer so no he wouldn’t have been able to help me on this issue thus Trace and Brock were indespensible but Cili the most cause in Unova he was threatened to death to comply or I would’ve left him among wild herds like Reshirams(all laugh) nice people though good social structure,middle schools are decent in that area for parents to worry less with rather indifferent childern like Cili(all burst into laughter) anyway,so these are my methods and so attend great philosophers like Pangoro’s discourse of mask of responsibility on freedom(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) Mehu was terrified by this countering package cause I was her husband even then so Violet was informed as was Mr Slate and thus Brock was under serious pressure(all laugh,Brock shakes his laughing) then Pangoro came first like this tremendus insight into twists and turns of life and their usage(all brust into laughter) then that was 22 years back at

schools are decent in that area for parents to worry less with rather indifferent childern like Cili(all burst into laughter) and Iris ever had to comply to keep her bunch sane(all laugh) anyway,so these are my methods and so on and yeah I do many more things like state jumping in subtle bodies for many hours and so on which Gary knows first hand infact quite a lot(all laugh) so you may ask him these all are to imply to my current condition of the misfortune that is but that psychic thrust has opened many more horizons in philosophy for me so rather invigorating that is and also many treates are there getting invented each hour hence Mehu too is happy(all laugh) but yeah you may know or not that till 19 and 11 she used to be physically violent to her big bros yeah the obvious crooked jackals(all brust into laughter) so no wonder that she is my soulmate(all laugh) she turned 20 when we set out for Johto then once occasion arose if it were a year and half before she would’ve torn apart Brock’s ears off from his sockets PHYSICALLY(all laugh) which Violet did in subtlity hence at her young age Mehu was inspired rather(all burst into lughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) anyway situation arose and she was about to do this but then Brock said you’re 20 now hence she desisted like suddenly it appeared to her that her teenage years are behind her for this term strangely though cause it’s just the age of the PHYSICALITY(all laugh) but it’s not a good thing what Brock did trying to make my wife RESPONSIBLE(all laugh) for which he has paid many prices and will continue to(all laugh)..now finally after everything pests were off and mom was extremely grave(all laugh),’Seth,what do you think you’ve become huh?(all laugh) one thing is pokemons master these are illegal crook stuff(all laugh) and don’t ever dare to drag my honey in this mess(all laugh) and yeah these meances have truly destroyed my son(all laugh) so then mom was getting serious thus pests were at us again and my bee goes again,no you see Mehu now knows quite a bit and you too via handling Mime just the right channel to view your intuitions to push them to the next level(all laugh) and no this is just the issue of treating beings equally being a being exactly why Mime is here still despite you not knowing much about pokemons in general(all laugh) I just went further cause these are my soulmates as is Mehu(all laugh) and yeah Trace,Brock,Gary,Daisy,Lillie all themselves and mostly Mehu herself have to use or have had to use many similar medicines me most of certain types cause I handle raw wild bunch and they then a bit refined language manuscript and thesis(all laugh) hence their medicines are bit different but Gary you may ask Giratina and Zeraora is mythical names not easy at all as they are to us(all laugh) but we want them to be us and we want to be them hence we’re family(all laugh) and yeah Violet is excluded cause being an Interregionally famed singer,composer,sho script writer etc she has tremendous knowledge on literature and subtle mental things,philosophy etc so she literally and metaphorically too lends us the voice(all laugh) hence we’re a family and yeah Dave too is too much knowledgeable about these who shows as does Mehu herself what happens if you apply them in normal profession hence they are virtually unbeatable in battles(all laugh) a few of Dave’s bunch will get spoiled may be with time so yeah only better days ahead(all laugh) then Gengleye was off so mom says,yeah I see ethical morality(ll laugh)..get rid of these translators first(all laugh) but yeah because in your words you’re a too cunning pro-fessional now(all laugh) you will interpret them anyway which will require illegal medicines to make you and all my sweet little childern again HUMAN(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and why is May excluded with Drew and Zara too(all alugh),’no they are in contests May and Drew they are immense there as well due to the system they couldn’t complete their career as you know were disturbing their personal lives beyond their toleration limit but would’ve become hall of famer officially too which they couldn’t do sadly but whole world knows them to be so unofficially cause many chosen so and so hasn’t been able to get the tag due to them hence they were emotionally tortured to clear their ways but I want to help Drew to restart cause he so wants still has 8 years left with paternal leave may be will have 5.5 enough for completing his career(all laugh) May can’t now that is either will get the tag and if she wants she will be beyond 40 when she finishes and she,Drew,everone and me we all know my sweet little sis can’t take that psychophysical pressure beside her motherhood and so on she is just too nice and all caring and sweet that’s not her character now that she has two sweet dolls so yeah that is that and Zara is the outside profession version of this surely you know how my bunch helped this lab to get rid of legal mess when I wasn’t present here cause they are independent totally only here cause they like me and I’m their soulmate and viseversa which they taught me(all laugh),via nervous channels spoiling your HUMAN life(all laugh),no this is the philosophical bloom(all burst into laughter) and know that was just accident and still hope is there and I don’t care it’s a blessing to me rather not us anyway,this is there about psychic processes and yeah I pushed Trace,Daisy,Gary and Lillie during that time before marrying Mehu last year after I returned from Cerulean here then I pushed them with my psychic bunch not these two only(all laugh)cause I had to know if me and Mehu belonged to them and the viseversa and so on in the ideological sphere that is(all burst into laughter) cause after all Mehu jumped on me who was a stranger(all laugh) none of her sisters did this and none of my bros did this it was normal unlike us(all laugh) and hence my bros weren’t as cunning as I am surely(all laugh) and Mehu is only too much more simple than her sisters who are more prudent cause they were older at a time when this test of character came and hence they were more self established but just like them Mehu ever has honoured her longing for me for 22 years you see through thick and thin and that too without any assurence at all which still is the case cause I know myself all for so and so(all laugh)thus Mehu only ever took my cunning advances as truth and took them for her assurence and still you see her honouring our marriage and so on whereas I forgot her in Unova as I told you before only knew about my bunch that is actually not very clean a logical explanation(all laugh) and this assurence in full truth by every means of it in it’s truest possible meaning which is explained thus in the polished language of my Guzzlord(all laugh) is that which surely her sisters have had since day 1 from my bros hence you see I’m under probation still(all burst into laughter)..now the two meances were off cause he was now expecting to laugh at the reply(all laugh) then mom was dissapointed and says your vultures have resurfaced in the opposite direction I see(all laugh) so your trouble now is the actual meanings of the words(all burst into laughter) at which your Hoopa explores new horizons each moment along with these two to show that to all despite you and most importantly them(all burst into laughter) now again pests grasped us and my bee says,no mom my trouble is that why would this idea of gender persist with me more than necessary after all(all laugh) that is if a pretty girl in that type of age range(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) suddenly pops up in front of me why even at 39 this attention(all burst into laughter) my bunch doesn’t have this trouble(all burst into laughter) take Charizard for example(all burst into laughter),what does he know more as himself than me hence he’s so happy(all burst into laughter) others like Bayleaf and Heracross(all laugh) still they only bother in the breeding season never in any other time and that’s mechanical to them even so in a way they also never bother why is it the trouble for me that I can’t stay attuned to my wife all time(al laugh) now pests were off so mom gravely said,unless you are with these two meances to personal life AND SANITY(all laugh) in subtlty so much as to your nerves are totally wrecked now(all laugh) with absue by every means which even most illegality can’t control anymore(all laugh) so now your mind is at a state where you have to discuss this with your mom in front of your wife why is she not of your gender but of that of your mom(all burst into laughter) thus you expect your mom to enlighten you upon this fact at the age of 67 to your 39(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Mehadi in fits of laughter and in tears laughing,Seth laughs a lot) then pests were at us again and my psychophysical hubby said(all burst into laughter),no this idea of gender so confining hence my Chu never got mingled just like Zekrom(all burst into laughter) you see Zekrom their view of life is the weakness of strength and the strength of weakness intersect at a point where you’re balanced enough to kill everyone else(all laugh),thus they must be asked what is natural weakness of nature(all burst into laughter),then they will go to their own strength points to decimate whole nature to try to figure it out but mentally that is(all laugh) thus they will come to know the trouble of nature is that it is known as nature(all burst into laughter) then Zekrom must be asked what is the strength of weakness of nature(all laugh) then they will try to figure out their weaknesses and then think why they exist to see if they have any meaning thus they might be of strong point thus they will realize all weaknesses are inherent to their idea of themselves only from the point of view of nature(all laugh) which was proved to be the trouble to begin with cause they think it’s the nature(all laugh) now they must be asked to differentiate between cognition and perception(all burst into laughter) now they will realize perception comes from trusting the nature of themselves which is proved to be troublesome thus cognition the next step is also wrong so they are totally wrong to think that they are Zekroms(all burst into laughter) or anything else that is(all laugh) now they must be questioned what is the diffrence between digestion and the idea of it(all burst into laughter) now they will realize that digestion is natural but the idea forces them to think they might have or not thus excretion or hunger comes which has no meaning(all burst into laughter) then they will understand this idea also comes because of themselves which are not hence the ideas are useless(all laugh) then they are to be asked what is the difference between thought and determination(all burst into laughter) then they will realize that thoughts are coming and going due to determination of being a Zekrom and viseversa(all laugh) hence actually nothing is there as a Zekrom hence they are freed from there own being thus they will want all to take to their realizations of course by interacting with their nevres to a degree that’s according to Zekrom is necessary for the humans(all laugh) and hece they want to get close to everyone mentally only to show they are no being at all hence their thought of so isn’t so either(all laugh) thus they aren’t interacting with a Zekrom then this same process that got the Zekrom out of his own being will encompass this human in psychic channels(all laugh) and he or she will be free thus my Zekrom wants to marry everyone showing them they have married just their idea of the same(all burst into laughter) hence they are freed(all burst into laughter) but this idea is not so vivid to me hence Mehu is still in parts psychophysical to me(all laugh) yeah the degree may be more or less but why does she have a form(all burst into laughter) this my Kyurem and Giratina answers cause in each moment she wrongly thinks she is born(all burst into laughter) and so do I so we actually are helping each other to get rid of this idea of being and she is my wife cause her and my path to achieve the same requires our current views to contrast yet support the individual hence they are same yet opposite hence we appear to each other as different yet same and hence we are most dear to each other in that type of relation(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus we’re married(all laugh) and this appearing difference of our ideas of unfoldment of self from being yet that exact opposite being most necessary for our process is why we are of different gender exactly what is troubling us and me for sure(all burst into laughter) which also encompasses my bros here especially Gary as Gary says(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laugh) hence their lives are similar like as said that of Gary and Lillie as again Gary told me(all laugh)..Mr Oak any opinions being that type of Mrs Oak(all burst into laughter)..” Gary(laugh) : “yeah,hence your Gyarados’ beau is a damn brat as well(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “Mr Oak why is called beau(all burst into laughter)” Gary(laugh) : “yeah,your hubby pest has definitely rubbed you the wrong way(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “Mr Oak now you said Lillie now why did you say why is called Lil and not Lie(all burst into laughter)..any help sister(all laugh)..” Lillie(all laugh) : “man,this is personally serious professional stuff(all laugh) AH!Mr Oak why are you called Gary Oak(all laugh)” Gary(laugh) : “cause I’ve been forced to live the Giratina life of accomodation of trivial to get the whole only which is trivial(all laugh)”


Mehadi(laugh) : “hence it’s called Mr Oak(all laugh),anyway then my hubby continues,anyway,then I looked at my uncle and aunt at Hoenn Mr and Mrs Maple(all burst into laughter) thus asked them(all uncontrollbaly laugh) no not me via my sources(all laugh),Mr Hopkins
Smugchal,Domurtsburg City,Normal gym,Hoenn was uncle’s travel companion,they travelled across Hoenn and Sinnoh for normal type specialization for more than 7+ long years then uncle took charge at 23 and 11 after those two by means of distant relations and Mr Smugchal’s cousin was actually the gym leader who retired the same year so he thus became too leader at Domurtsburg and both were extremely good since the start,Mr Hopkins was already in hall of fame before uncle was,who was unnecessarily delayed by the great so and so who had to update their textbooks after Snorlax,a normal type got me the title(all laugh) then he was asked when I was Hoenn by my sources at Hoenn I had Hoopa and Gourgeist at press conferences(all laugh) and
many things were being said then Hoopa said get the real meaning and Gourgeist added then 2nd step is just the meaning without links(all burst into laughter)..so I understood they told me to see the soulmate as it is without links hence I couldn’t be confining myself to only here these four families(all laugh) then I forced Lubos to get my required infos(all burst into laughter)..well,you know,Lubos and we have come into terms now and he says all these blurred my vision(all laugh) to which my bee said yeah,I understand that I was mad then myself(all laugh) but Jasu is of no use is he(all laugh),and Lubos said well to me of huge use cause I’m so happily retired at a corner with an all important vote against him always(all laugh) then we both said yeah that age(all laugh) and then he continues,so Mr Norman Maple,hall of fame then became the Pettelsberg gym leader at just about 24 and then Mrs Opal Maple she isn’t from our profession and doesn’t have any pokemons either,they met at a party when uncle was 23 and she was 23 too,she is an accountant infact and then they married when they were 25 and May came into current existence when they were 27 and Max when they were 31(all laugh) then I met them when they were 44 and 44(all laugh)..so this numbered list went on(all laugh)..so their family and life very smooth perfectly epitomizes the name Balance for the badge that is(all laugh),uncle got his Hall of Fame nomination when he was 46 and his gym was my last gym there at Hoenn and uncle’s nomination was atleast delayed by atleast 4 to 5 years as well(all laugh) they are 60 now,uncle is in his last 5 years of his career anyway then May and Drew met when they were 16 in-front of me infact(all laugh) and they are very sweet natured persons and Max and his girlfriend Vidonia too similar then I looked at Mr Oscar Slate(all burst into laughter) he and his wife Mrs Flores Dybert Slate similar were travel companions at very first region for both but only(all laugh) then Flores travelled around the world and Oscar was gym leading thus the longitudinal differences in psychophysicality were trying to hinder them(all burst into laughter) which didn’t happen cause they were one reality together appearing to each other due to the idea of being as different but with each other they are ever full ONE and hence they may be anywhere are bound to come together non-psychophysically the appearance to us and to them is just their play and we’re part of it as well(all laugh) then I looked at my dear sweetest baby sis Dawnny please don’t chew you nails vigourously(all burst into laughter) and my nephew Mango Nus(all laugh)..they well whole world knows are soulmates by all means cause of their nature,Dawn needs a very caring and jovially sweet husband and Mango needs a wife who is as much forward as him yet as sweet as him which Dawn exactly is hence they are absolutely soulmates but then I looked at my uncle and aunt Mr Ian Berlitz and Mrs Johanna Glevin Berlitz(all laugh)..aunty is one time Sinnoh contest winner,uncle was in general training was in profession as well both are 72 now Dawn is 30 so she came to them at 42(all laugh)..yeah Goodra is indispensable(all laugh)..due to this age difference they thought she is their little daughter not my baby sis(all laugh) hence were abjectly Crawdauntogated(all laugh)..thus now all are very happy and their story is something like that met on travels then aunty became a champ in her last region at Sinnoh and then they had a tough time together with mental propensities and all then later as usual truth will shine forth no matter as said Naganadel in that discourse on difference between matter and composure of any chatter(all brust into laughter)..so this made my convictions stronger as Cili was there too(all burst into laughter) hence I looked at him and his other half Jenny they were travel companions then eventually realized about their bond thus became naive without observing it’s foundation obdurately(all laugh) but then this was nothing to beauty as I looked at Mr Kane Halmsly(all burst into laughter) and Mrs Irene Cobter Halmsly an amusingly wise person who so politely said I’m a personally professional mole(all burst into laughter) they are similar as is Tony and Olivia,Harris and Brenda,Jaheem and Flavia,Samuel and Maria,Cilan and Jeniffer,Ferdinand and Iris,Glenn and Linda,then also as is Hamish and Lamia,Penny and Sandra,Ralph and Beatrice,Shawn and Clair,Martin and Pamela,Ryan and Nina,Samson and Olga,Ethan and Vrishali,Ritchie and Andrea,Barry and Winnona,Fabian and Karen,Nikolas and Rosetta,Juan and Stella,Carlos and Greta,Keith and Cheryl,Helder and Cynthia,Luke and Astrid,Brian and Avery,Diego and Valerie,Dustin and Wendy,Milintica and Audrey,Yakup and Novella,Travis and Sophia,Kevin and Doris,Dawson and Tacincala,Joel and Whitney,Japp and Dorothy,Noah and Reese,Diego and Valerie,Ronald and Nancy,Monkhbat and Yanase,,Donald and Felicia,McShin Stuie and McShin Marrie(all brust into laughter),Benjamin and Carla,Albert and Immaculata,Gordon and Bertha,Balthazar and Aurora,Reymond and Celestia,Felix and Trinity,Igor and Gardenia,Keaton and Questa,Hilbert and Ela,Virgil and Yumn,Norbert and Ivana,Percy and Samantha..then(laugh) added continuously but in this tone Paul and Fiona,Saul and Junia,Nigel and Solana,Jasu and Fantina..(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..and(laugh) was counting(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..so this huge list went on then says,so these enstrengthed my intuitions(all burst into laughter) and Drew’s parents are too sweet persons Mr Ervine and Mrs Aurelia Blackmore both out of profession and doesn’t have any pokemons not even a Spinda(all laugh) and is in good jobs now retired though they are 64 now and when they were 32,Shrew came to them in this form of cultured Drew(all burst into laughter) who said please May it’s ok if you spew I’m very well educated as then what and how to do(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..yeah this was told to them as usual as you know and May died three lives later instantly(all laugh) and her destitute rose said(all laugh) see how he belittles my family in front of everyone(all laugh)..anyway then my hubby continues,and I spoke to them uncle and aunty Drew’s parents many times they actually ever told me Drew has a big bro as well a very true one(all burst into laughter) and yeah he was even then just a sweet little kid so I had to look after him philosophically(all burst into laughter) so about them May told me once so I knew that(all laugh) theirs was an arranged marriage actually no not famillial the dates were arranged by friends same stuff as in case of Dr Tracey Foxly Traced The Daisyl(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) actually I went further from this point that what if a relation blooms only if it is arraged and when is the case that it doesn’t despite meeting for example say Gary and Lillie contrasting with Jaheem and Flavia or Trace and Daisy the most intriguing(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) in case of Gary and Lillie it was that the youth was just blooming(all laugh) Jaheem and Flavia met in Oragne but later by mutual connections got closer due to the eventual oneness that a few vultures anyway(all laugh) then let’s look at the case of Dr Tracey Skechit(all laugh) cause it was the most engaging one(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) Trace came to us in Pasio saying I’m a professional butler here’s my recommendation showed his Venonat(all brust into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) then he is as good and pure a character as you know as I did insantantly albeit in intuitions as he showed Venonat that he is so cause he is a buffoon(all laugh) thus is the butler eternally(all laugh) but he was forced into Cerulean which he actually wanted to avoid cause Mehu wasn’t there then and he never liked the show(all laugh) but actually we forced him in there Mehu just said that Daisy is nice unless you can stay strict enough to her sentimental games(all laugh) I said look lad(all laugh),Mehu is my best friend NOW(all laugh) that word confirmed him what I meant cause surely I knew Mehu was my wife since the very beginning the rest is a way away from the EMOTIONS(all laugh) Hoenn if either me or she were together would’ve hindered each other so Daisy was right in a way EXCEPT should’ve happened along with a few men being introduced to me exactly on the day of Johto parting(all laugh) anyway then I told Gary is back to his wigging vaults and Brock is a fool(all laugh) so you’re left thus why don’t we make Cerulean our NEW NEST(all laugh,Seth laughs a lot  ehadi) this idea captivated him much(all laugh) cause his ears were ever naturally pinpointed towards the lunny days(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) strange though why would people prefer the moon over the sun given the degree of effulgence and power a poverty of perceptive persevearence umbrellas aren’t that costly(all uncontrollblay laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) and then the eventual cause Daisy needed the same as well cause her idea of her husband was just exactly and absolutely Trace and the viseversa minus the sentiment(all laugh) hence it was so naive(all laugh)and Dave’s and Iris’ cases I knew cause I know the families all similar like Brawn(all laugh) everhappy and sweet Brawn confessed to Mrs Lucia when he was mid ocean at Cerulean surfing,his phone somehow worked cause she was on a boat(all burst into laughter) and yeah his son my little bro or more like nephew little Magnus Mango Nus(all laugh) proposed to my sweet little Dawnny sis saying Dawnny please STAND STILL(all brust into laughter) but thus all these intrigued me(all burst into laughter) to look at Mr and Mrs Skechit and especially Mr Hector Skechit(all burst into laughter,Tracey uncontrollably laughs) this was hard cause they were totally out of profession thus I used Trace cause he’s an idiot(all burst into laughter) actually it was just the week before the day I married Mehu I pressed him with my psychics not them(all laugh) then knew a bit cause he knew a bit(all laugh) this was about Mr Desmond Skechit and Mrs Lorette Readhart Skechit but not Mr Hector Skechit(all burts into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) as you know I came to know about Hector from himself infact when he realized that Trace was all along right and Trace also realized why Hector and Mr Desmond was right that if he got into his current profession,he will be mentally taken for granted by certain pests like these two fondly though hence only(all burst into laughter),so actually this Skechit family was the most ENDEARING(all burst into laughter,Daisy and Tracey uncontrollably laugh) thus you see,Mr Desmond Skechit was at a general govt administration job and was very strict person more so cause of his job that is very hard but he in these days in retirement are happy cause my bunch actually was invited by him as you know(all burst into laughter) I took Pelipper and Rayquaza(all burst into laughter),Pelipper told him this idea of something that is like a target or a thing very charming cause they are most suitable to the right way perceived may be true but for that why the person will be suffering cause after all the deal is that he is the one who searches that happiness in reverse as well hence the real deal is to be searching unhappiness within then the outside unhappiness is mitigated cause already the stomach on fire why look at someone else’s hunger unless it’s rather endearing to know that after all he’s my food(all burst into laughter) then Rayquaza says thus it’s realizable actually according to dragonic manuals why we must prey the right kind of food that if examined by looking through the right kind of eye of a dragon(all burst into laughter) it is seen that this hunger is actually ever there no matter the prey or the hunter hence to get rid of this a dragon realizes he must be at all three elements equally to prey(all burst into laughter),my compeer means that if this idea of dragonic hunting is if looked at properly then it is just that this very idea of another is the trouble that is why the deal exists between me and my doesn’t it(all burst into laughter),hence according to the awakening of dragonic potential dictates that one must get rid of this my cause it’s an hindernce to me the dragon if I know that I’m a dragon then what’s the point of the idea of dragon to exist cause it’s just me which is exactly why I don’t understand this hence this idea has been created only by me(all brust into laughter) but still my current being tells me I’m a dragon so I ask you to show me what is a dragon(all burst into laughter),hence you see my compeer here means show yourself that you’re a human knowing so to being with hence you can’t cause that deal is potentially stale hence will definitely fail(all burst into laughter),thus you see like a dragona human can’t be specified hence why do you think you’re a human and not a dragon(all burst into laughter) cause you know both but I’m claimed to be a dragon like you claim yourself to be a human thus make me dragon make yourself human you can’t either thus why this futility(all burst into laughter),hence to deal with this trouble you must get rid of this idea of deal that is ever another why bother cause you really are what you are so why you will be this and thus not the other(all burst into laughter) this got Mr Desmond so happy that he actually told us why even at 83 he feels fresh enough to jump into ocean with Azumarill not Marill though(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) actually he said that his distaste from pokemons came from his idea that the money we get is not at all in the right way cause we kinda abuse natural resources(all laugh) his idea was to use pokemons in many developmental works and all as they are used but the business that our profession is was never a very good thing to him cause he faced many Choiced ones from our profession and being at Robtomaroon City,Kanto it’s understandable if not more(all laugh) but he said this career that I’ve had till even I was at Elite4 Johto only to him was just that the translators were good and I was trying to sell this profession as something very high(all laugh) actually many philosophers and mind the word intellectuals contacted me now the tense before(all laugh) during my mid to late Elite4 saying you’re diluting serious things(all laugh) I ever said well we everywhere talk about universality it’s rather a tribute I guess just that you want it by other sources like you from whom we got the translators right(all laugh) they understood that this only creates more job and money for them so were too happy(all laugh) but a few at Kalos I know were extremely happy with this and now is in the heavens cause this is the gateway to that maddening tune(all laugh) as is the general govt ceratinly at Kalos,Unova,Sinnoh and Kanto all said yeah great call of the bottom line(all laugh) but now in an enjoyable way rather(all laugh) and you know I have contacts with Unova region military and been at the head quarters as well being a honourary citizen there I was there and was my RESPONSIBILITY(all laugh) there had a long chat they were very nice to me and those men and women so much ahead of me atleast in all character traits said they liked the translators and all it just made their day a bit more enjoyable and that was a lot to me(all smile) but then again Unova is run by a Mr Marc Litman who called Mehu yesterday and asked her,Mehadi when you come here bring your Manaphy my Virizion isn’t well may need help from experienced evolved states(all laugh) sweet sweet Marc faced Mehu at Kanto and defeated her then told her he wished to go back to her age cause a region finishes too quickly(all laugh) he was in his third region then(all laugh) we both have had too much contact with that brat so namecalls her(all laugh) but it’s an honour as you know it’s an honour to know personally the one and only Marc the Mr Litman(all laugh) but yeah they at general government realize all must be at my cost with my close ones cause the actualization of these require you to let your nerves be limitlessly meanuvered by pokemons like Kommo-O(all laugh) in the wild of course(all laugh) which is a great experience thought knowing their researches on metaphysics(all burst into laughter) so.),then Mrs Lorette also had similar views and she being at finances knew which selected people deal in that section at Kanto pokemon authorities(all laugh) so they were rather not happy with this at all then their careers(all laugh),now Mrs Lorette is also 81 now and they were actually classmates at college there they met,Hector was born when they both were 26 and Trace when they were 31 when doctors were asked don’t check me I’m ok but such a long time you’re here isn’t it a bit um..stressful(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and hence he was named Tracey the warrior that fights against masked traitors that’s the own emotions not exclusive(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..” Tracey(laugh) : “yeah this brat Gyarados is also following Gengarian view of life now(all laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “MARSHADOW(all laugh)..then my Pallet bee says,and now I also came to know about Hector from himself infact(all laugh) just his career and all,he also a brilliant student,is an engineer and then studied till 26 came out with a huge service as a project manager at a big compnay then later was in director post in another company and he had similar experiences himself and hence he never liked Trace’s ambitions and then again he is 5 years younger(all laugh),Hector actually studied at Glubotstrog,Kalos then Trace was sent there as Venturiastrog,Kalos the nearest city both the places are famous has a gym as well in the intersection bug gym that is not in hall of fame at the time I traveled there hence I didn’t visit this scheduling mom isn’t kind you know 5.5 years minimum per region Marc agrees(all laugh) anyway then Trace fled the scene and as you know too much fondness for corners(all laugh) so went to Pasio and so on,whole family too cultured too nice too gentle(all laugh) and you know Trace with all these he also is a jackal(all laugh) so.),he has had his career and now Hector is alright with him and all and whole family is very good to him now but they actually ever had high respect for Daisy though cause she is a gym leader after all(all laugh) and has had a significant hand behind Cerulean’s rise to where it is today a chosen anyway(all laugh) and all her sisters actually they did a lot for that forsaken anyway(all laugh) hence they had regards and respect and love for their daughter-in-law and sister-in-law that was ok but Hector’s other half Mrs Rochana Amrsharst Skechit is also actually in the same company she is an engineer too they too met at college and she is also from Kanto,Redheart City actually,same age to Hector but Trace met Daisy at workplace though hence the relationship was more serious,matured,free and smooth hence of much longer term(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs)..no he said this as well(all laugh)..his anger on the whole world including himself is that the jackal should’ve been sweared as well so that he married Dase that year itself saving her 3 years of agony(all laugh) and then Blasie and Jas also has had to wait for three more years due to him thus will finish their first region when their parents are 62+(all laugh) which is best at 59+(all laugh) anyway then he told those and yeah this too he said vilifying himself to mom as he does(all laugh) and the pests of course had ceased us and mom was extremely angry and dissapointed(all laugh) hence the pests as well as their master pest was so much enjoying it and I could hardly stay alive(all laugh) then he said,well then about Daisy you know too gentle and very self established and had to be even more so at a very early age as well so was good but her thing was like my mom wasn’t all involved in battling that Mehu was despite her success now was as involved as Lillie who is as famous a star as Violet is certainly at Johto-Kanto region and a very very well known name at Hoenn and Pasio too,Violet whole world knows as a star barring Kalos strangely(all laugh) who had the audacity to disrespect Mehu even after Tlplocus operation saying just your Chu(all laugh) so I offered them my Nivy thus they immediately fled the scene(all laugh) so you see there’s no difference to me and Mehu by any means it’s just a matter of expression hence Jelliogredos are damn bra
