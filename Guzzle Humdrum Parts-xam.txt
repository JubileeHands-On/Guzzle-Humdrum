ecame a bro cause first Utranercozma came(alllaugh) and then Kalos bunch took notime to get spoiled Incineroar the epitome of that so I became bro and Zara for same reason became sis(all laugh) after my Cerulean badge the 2nd last in Kanto afetr Yellowburst and the last was Pewter cause I wanted to follow him opposite way(all laugh) I told him and he always asked about the opposition and so on as he was being fed substandard food at 187 grand hotels and 72 motels(all laugh) but this time said rather said yeah be brief that’s the worst of the 3(all laugh) Daisy Waterflower was way better cause not a star(all laugh) and then again what else that so and so Gyarados(all laugh) I said no Golduck,Jellicent,Sharpedo(all laugh) against Palkia(all laugh) but Palkia went down to Jellicent in a draw cause Golduck was too good if not Jellicent(all laugh) Golduck vs Palkia took 37 Minutes then Jellicent vs Palkia took 39 minutes so after 76 minutes she was on her last brat me 2nd(all laugh) so then I went with Kyogre(all laugh) who went down to Sharpedo(all laugh) this took 41 minutes and now after 117 minutes still she was only smiling as usual(all laugh) and hence I knew how good Mehadi was and why the name is necessary(all laugh),yeah yeah enough(all laugh),then I realized still so much heart wrenching(all laugh) so said Sharpedo afterwards was one punch away(all laugh) so I went with Feraligator(all burst into laughter) no that name now is something really everywhere(all laugh) entering general dictionary for sure as Gengar already is there(all laugh) and no it didn’t take short(all laugh) but 15 more minutes(all laugh) but man Palkia and Kyogre couldn’t...just your impulse seeing the Golduck..Feraligator should’ve been first to cunningly get the brat lulled(all laugh) then Dragons would’ve decimated the brat cause Golducks are naturally happy going bunch and Palkias are best lie detectors(all laugh) so that brat couldn’t fool him saying I want to battle till death cause he doesn’t(all burst into laughter) then Jellicent should’ve been given water sentiment not psychic or dragon cause that brat is chill and cool in thought of play(all laugh) so feed him exactly that and make him happy then prey upon him(all laugh) again detect the lie(all laugh) and only that will puzzle the brat to submit himself as to how his playing tricks are needed to be less responsible(all burst into laughter) a trick each time would get any gym leader toppled cause otherwise you can’t keep a Jellicent in a gym(all burst into laughter) though my Jellicent knows of thousand other methods to fool the whole world both way but none are responsible(all laugh) cause they don’t know what it means(all laugh) thus the gym leader should’nt either or else they’ll teach the lesson(all laugh) yet mine can be responsible too showing irresponsibility and the viseversa(all laugh) and this fooling around saves your energy for the last incessesant one whose medicine is to tell him you can’t walk na na(all burst into laughter) then when he is told to tell you that you walk to beau I swim calculate the quicker(all burst into laughter,.) then jump in the water and charge at him he will be too happy but sidestep him and charge at his master(all laugh) he will catch you being faster then tell him I was going to complain to your beau(all burst into laughter) meaning your Palkia took that the brat’s master is the beau so can swim as quickly which is wrong so the brat has to protect her thus responsible thus lose(all burst into laughter) as you will then say that your beau is standing there I can reach you can’t(all burst into laughter) but yeah I can’t swim quicker if in water so lets discuss about responsible dates(all burst into laughters) finally when he is frustrated cause he will want to play but doesn’t due to responsibility and Palkia detects this lie(all burst into laughter and .) and you’re so fresh cause you haven’t fought at all(all laugh) create the dragon rage whirl at full force to get the brat out of water then hyper beam it out of roof(all laugh) cause detecing a lie after death will get the Palkia back to life to do something about it(all burst into laughter) but the Palkias I saw so far most are kids at most going to advanced universites or just about proposed seriously for a change(all burst into laughter) your has some material of wise life and beyond cause it’s battle scaled(all laugh) to be less responsible(all laugh) thus should be rubbed to that way but remember the other brats will infringe their trust with Palkia and so on and then with you it’s just so many things that needs to be done by enquerying them psychologically creating pressure of exams again and again(all laugh) but anyway your Palkia would’ve beaten that leader in this way and her obsession with using Golduck first and not second and Jellicent the other way around to create the more-less responsible to the less-more responsible cause only then she is going with her choise and Sharpedo must always be last IF trained right to be not serious at all(all laugh) or might’ve been Kyogre in place of Jellicent cause then the less-more would’ve become rather blur but then Sharpedo will spoil the expected marks getting one more by copying hallucination(all burst into laughter) and so on many possibilities for both of you but these are natures only and ways to get the job done butt I don’t understand her obsession to force her psychics to use those useless jovial classroom joke hallucinations(all burst into laughter) cause the wickedness isn’t properly veiled which can only be done in kids find first beau behind 2nd beau hallucinations(allburst into laughter,.) cause then you’re wicked so the opponent gets that and does plan to counter and exactly when they counter you say life is such(all burst into laughter) that means you were being honest only that you’re more wicked than they think(all laugh) so the brat would’ve been at bay as his master would’ve been baffled to see the overall package of honestly dishonest hallucinations(all burst into laughter,.) they have to be varied though the thousands of degrees
and subcategories are there exactly which are themselves and the whole as well just a hallucination says my Grossy(all burst into laughter) yeah everyday as you know a new
hallucination is being defined according to Metagross(all laugh)?


then says could’ve been Tapu Fini,Slowking and Manaphy as well pseudo-legend psychic then normal psychic then only pseudo-legend natural psychic with fairy tendency which Tapu Fini has a bit as well then Carracosta in it against Palkia not good but Kyogre good enough or even Primarina if trained with Kaledo infighting(all laugh) Kaledo would’ve been not of any use against either Palkia or Kyogre at all cause he has been made responsible(all burst into laughter) but this idea that she has that she can battle is her downright stupidity(all burst into laughter) cause she is teaching her students you rather battle your style is rather in each move you study and then decide and do the next move and then only the next move comes which you sometimes may predict or sometimes just wait to counter but she mostly predicts and counters less you the opposite and hence she teaches you are a grand student ever she more of a teaching mentality like you are a better researcher she the professor like Crawdaunt and Feraligator(all burst into laughter) I said,well I’m only happy we’re not pokemons and we don’t ask Gary for the reason of this(all laugh) being born that is(all laugh) then he continued,or like Gengleye(all burst into laughter)she is Gengar you Sableye but she resists herself to not be a Gengar hence her troubles unnecessarily(all burst into laughter) but exactly why she thinks she has a specific gender(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) and hence I do too(all burst into laughter) hence she broke-up herself cause that was the premise logically disproving which we agreed to travel in the forest to start with(all burst into laghter) then I somehow managed not to laugh too much to avoid becoming Sablaye thus remembering my gender for my wife’s sake to avoid her horripilation even in divorce proceedings in witness box(all uncontrollbaly laugh) especially more so cause the lawyears will be Crawdauntogator(all laugh) the judgement can only be let’s tickle to be countering(all laugh) anyway then after this Gengarian wisdom,asked him can your bunch manage other pokemons in battles(all laugh),yeah why not(all laugh) if they allow them to that is to have their ways out of the despondency of this present being(all laugh) this presence is what my Banette researches upon(all burst into laughter) as you know cause it doesn’t exist conceptually only as a thirst to think on the same(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah I understand your stylish translators(all laugh) then he says,yeah that should’ve been brought forth ages ago why this obsession with being Seth that I have Dave which my Kyurem doesn’t like and she has sound logic as well for that(all burst into laughter) I said you better have noiser logic(all laugh),I see too fond(all laugh)so was she hence her troubles(all laugh) I thought yeah obviously mutual(all laugh) then he told me how his brats were gym battling exchanging the leader’s role as well using his or her the pokemons(all laugh) like once in a psychic gym Buzzwole managed a Goodra and Snorlax managed a Rayquaza(all laugh) and those two being involved in too much bonhomie the philosophical conference in the name of battle truly did become so maddening(all laugh) yeah I know him Mr Pinto Sancher,hall of fame famous gym he was discussing on certain aspects of life and newspapers with bro in dining room(all laugh) gave a few brats to SnorWole and returned after like 30 minutes(all laugh) his brats were not sane then at all(all laugh) still says each gym actually that the effect is so sweetening that it remains hence Marc is so apprehensive of his own bunch just like Jasu(all laugh) but McShin only sighs(all laugh) says I faced him twice man no chance(all laugh) but Marc says then I’m in hell cause at the same time I had to be at Kanto and Johto(all laugh) beat me four damn times once at Kanto semis(all laugh)..I had Sakura’s number WRITEEN ON MY COAT(all laugh) and no McShin and Marc are the only people to have beaten her except Iris ofcourse(all laugh) and Dave is Dave you know(all laugh) Jasu and Percy came close but couldn’t rest says it’s unfair(all laugh) anyway Marc says and I thought well I’ll get him like Percy(all laugh) but man Percy is just a sweet sweet kid(all laugh) this brat is just KOMMO-O(all laugh) and has to be none wants to see a one that’s his family that is(all laugh)..no you know Zed’s matches are something else(all laugh) anyway then Marc says as soon as I set my brats out my WHOLE bunch REVOLTED(all laugh) so Marc is too maddened with everything now(all laugh),



anyway then about my match with sis bro then says,Tapu Fini at full potential must be told to study the varying levels of caution that one has when this urge to expand the self out of being comes up and why does it happen despite the urge itself(all burst into laughter) then he will answer that this caution is the reason for that urge and that urge isn’t necessary at all cause that itself is the illusion that’s the necessity of the same to continue it to hinder him all the time(all laugh),cause
one wants to expand cause one thinks that he’s the one and only(all laugh) if he didn’t then he has no reason or meaning to be a being(all laugh) thus if he doesn’t know the reason is because this being is not self sufficient hence this urge comes to validate it and everything else is spontaneous to find that closing door to which ends the being but this just piles up the dust rather one must understand how to turn against the very own being cause that’s what it does all time look at the time now it’s midnight at your place so why are you in rush to sleep(all burst into laughter),because you think you’re a being that needs to but in subtle body that isn’t there hence who are you(all burst into laughter) if Tapu Fini knows this(all burst into laughter) then he can deliver against the lie detection the host of poor men’s get together party(all burst into laughter) where you get trapped by the emotion of closure that the fairy nature of Tapu Fini will help thus even if you do detect the lie still you will get emotional then the psychic cruelty works that his income is so mearge and family responisibilities so now what if Tapu Fini gets unemployed(all burst into laughter) this will make you think twice this time bought is the victory(all laugh) then this is Palkia but Kyogre life dictates that the vastness of ocean and sky confines themselves in the solid state hence it’s about potential of life thus they will kill you to see through you,you see(all burst into laughter) so for anyone to get to the full potential one must let himself getkilled(all laugh) then to do that(all burst into laughter) Kyogre must be asked of his opinions on the idea of mistake and definition(all burst into laughter) mistakes will be there so will definitions otherwise life can’t go by this path of illusion hence he will cut off every possible mistakes and definitions as well to realize the potential is only full if dead(all brust into laughter) hence his being will surpass himself thus at full potential he will be too happy to battle(all brust into laughter) cause there’s no such thing as other cause that’s a mistaken definition(All burst into laughter) thus he will kill you to or try to by fondling with your nerves at his whim(all burst into laughter) and if you don’t allow he will tame you by himself(all burst into laughter) then such a Kyogre is brilliant but then she might’ve used Slowking who must be asked of his opinions on break-ups(all burst into laughter) mentally that is(all burst into laughter) the point when you don’t trust your partner of husband or beau of even like family parents,siblings,children,relatives anyone when you don’t trust then that moment before you are decided beyond doubts is when your being is most free cause you don’t depend upon any hence your’re too trapped cause you depened upon yourself(all burst into laughter) cause your idea of the self is just your being hence wrong all and then this was fuelled by the trust you had and so on but in this junction is Slowking is taken too many times his happiness will turn into depression that is killing him(all burst into laughter) sanity that is(all burst into laughter) hence he gets woken to the slowness of kingsley life of irresponsibility(all burst into laughter) this means he’s never serious thus he’s ever winner cause the idea of responsibility is an hindrence that is hindering my well being here you see Dave why am I Seth Ketchum(all burst into laughter) I said,well I don’t agree with your Kyurem on this(all laugh) and say it’s cause you’re born so(all laugh) but what about Manaphy(all laugh),yeah the Manaphian life says innocence is a crude virtue(all burst into laughter) there are many you see who wants this innocence this naivety some are born so(all laugh,Seth cheers for Boulder all laugh even more,Brock laughs shaking his head) then this urge is ever there cause when we depend on others we may have to have some degree of dishonesty that is a burden and hence we’re not happy thus this infact permeates the whole life to every degree hence you can’t be innocent at all thus you should be crude but at the same time this is going to overburden you cause you are going against your natural state but that state itself it actually the reason for your trouble(all laugh) thus the only way to get rid of this is to be innocently cunning(all laugh) that is you try to know this idea of other why it exists is cause you exist as other to them(all burst into laughter) thus this idea of innocence to them will become Manaphy’s veil to hallucinate other people while he himself is free of it thus he is no being but then if he isn’t any being he isn’t bothered at all about others cause they don’t exist so the innocence is naturalized and thus this very existence is the hallucination as to they won’t know what Manaphy wants hence he wins cause this idea the opponent’s master will foist on his pokemon that Manaphy is here to battle which he isn’t(all burst into laughter) hence it breaks his chain with the master and you win(all laugh) so to get to this point a Manaphy must be asked to prepare a lecture that pierces through the idea he has of his master(all burst into laughter) this bond will get him to be pure and the previous state thus he rather will take you under his wings but if you don’t allow him to have his ways then he will take liberties with your brain(all burst into laughter) then I said,I only am so greateful to myself that I didn’t do this to mine(all laugh) but can a pokemon get to this level in wild and if he can then can you catch him(all laugh),yeah they have to have that idea when they are born then they can with experience but yeah human stages are important my lab colleagues has played a huge role in my bunch’s state that you know without the liberty and the medicines they would’nt have become what they are now,medicines my colleague used that is(all laugh) and yeah they might be still in wild but they may come to you if you go to wild like you know I went to Hematoborg district forest,Cariostrog,Kalos to get a Dusknoir and I didn’t use any pokemons directly cause with my experience of ghosts I thought they are rather courteous to foregin travellers who ask for an opinion of the currenet times of his society from them(all uncontrollbaly laugh)like poverty(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) so I went there first my bunch played around with me cause I was discussing the same with them to get the compatriots opinion on the country(all burst into laughter) then we approached them then I asked them who are financially poor among them(all brust into laughter) finance is as you know the intelligence factor(all laugh) then they said intelligence is you see lad is your mistake of being(all laugh) cause if you were intelligent why are you bounded by the idea of the yourself(all burst into laughter) then I had a good time at their colleges(all laugh) one of their bright students came along with me she was in a great service among them was doing her thesis on disturbence due to the idea of time(all burst into laughter) this actually is a trouble you see in their life as well as ours cause their view of life is if no time then no idea of anything hence all is to it’s fullest but the idea of time is intrinsic as long as you’re a being cause each moment it will force you the idea of moment and hence you must be not so to go to the fullest to live the perfect Dusknoir life that is philosophically firm hence metaphysically supple(all burst into laughter) thus I asked her to teach me the difference between temporality and subjectivity(all burst into laughter),she later told me after getting in my group that yeah this ideas are contradictory to each other cause your idea of subject is ever you hence being you why this futile urge again to be you(all laugh) and the idea of time is the reason for that which again is neated if you were you then now still so why the time hence nothing can be fixed upon in time or being thus there’s no point in being sane either cause temporality is responsibility and subjectivity is sanity hence if you know you’re sane why appease others being responsible to yourself(all burst into laughter) and the viseversa if you’re responsible why be sane(all burst into laughter) but you can’t be in both cases hence you must get rid of the idea and thus comes the real time and sanity and everything living in time knowing it’s just an idea of non exactitude that points to the insanity cause you’re such as you are no being hence all these are hallucinations thus why bother at all about anything except time when you can remain non-exact thus can penetrate those who are not so that’s your food cause they will like you(all laugh) so you see Dave why my lab is so unique(all laugh) I said yeah,hence they are paid that sum(all laugh) but hence also I guess you entered volcanoes unprotected to unearth such gems to us at the cost of your lab and opponents(all laugh),no it’s just this idea you know that I have that has been troubling me since day 0 here why am I a human(all burst into laughter) hence Kyurem is so important in my life you see and the viseversa and then Charizard too(all burst into laughter) cause his idea of proper approach to dates if is seen through it’s just you yourself ain’t it this idea you had of Zara and the viseversa is why you were there in the first and then you two are soulmates so basically the oneness became manifested but before that it still was idea and it’s the same for all if you didn’t have an idea of her and the viseversa why would you be bothered at all but you did get enough bothered means the actuality only translates if patience to find own self is there hence Bulbasaur told you what is the meaning of what(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah I’m so lucky that I don’t have one myself who forces himself to be me and hence the viseversa is too maddening for me(all laugh),yeah,this problem of length of time and the pressure of history too has been worked upon by my Gothitelle(all brust into laughter) her method is that if I was then and I am now and so on then why not question the very then that then was I and now is questioned so now is me and thus I become the time hence where’s objectivity thus history(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah being from Celestic surely such guides would’ve took away many people’s jobs and researches if not sanity(all laugh),that brat told my Reuniclas how can you know you’re now hungry unless you know you were fed before hence how can battle having known you did before but not before this(all brust into laughter)


then bro went on to talk about Mantine(all laugh and cheers for Violet,Violet laughs a lot) how Mantine’s life is about being happily ferrying the idea of insanity(all burst into laughter) any idea(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “I’m only happy that I didn’t teach philosophy to my boy(all laugh) else would’ve intruded mid song to tell me give up this confining idea of harmony to be free(all burst into laughter)”
David(laugh) : “yeah mid-match still better than that atleast(all laugh)then I after this long sermon(all laugh) asked him how long does it take(all laugh) said that well all about the nature of pokemons and to beat the brat in his own game so he changes the nature or not(all laugh) but deepens it each time(all laugh) I said yeah 10 lives later may be(all laugh) and he never used to speak in such details in case of other gyms as to my strategies rather said yeah this combination and that way of attacking and so on like normal people do(all laugh) but no they weren’t normal either(all laugh) cause you know he never attacked at all after 1st year travel all the brats themselves did(all laugh) he day one told me they were asked what is the difference between attacking idea and idea oritented attack(all burst into laughter)..**


so then actually didn’t want to influence me much cause once you hear these you don’t want to attack either to your utmost doom(all laugh) bro as many say was just the tonic needed to get to your work once more with a smile on your face hence only he is so sought after with his bunch but the smiles in Gary and Trace and now Brock’s face tell a different story(all laugh) and Brock actually travelling was way easier wasn’t it than 24/7 lunacy(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah,atleast could mingle in foods without getting caught(all laugh)” David(laugh) : “actually your dishes were too delicious to get them along with bro to this state(all laugh) anyway,so this went on in case of other gyms but then as usual the mention of Mehadi and her skills mean they must be absolutely as according to him cause she’s his forever wife hence must be a Gengar as well(all laugh) and I must be told that way of countering to and hallucinating(all laugh) so that he himself later has food for thought on how to counter himself(all laugh) and if I can help on that(all laugh) well Feraligator ever could and sadly does despite our wishes(all laugh) and that much bro did too cause he had that big bro attitude then hidden towards me otherwise and that in general as May and Drew says especially Drew cause bro was after him(all laugh) I only wonder if my wife had a bro and asked me she will get mentally decapacitated will you like the vomit still(all laugh) and my answer will be judged by my Kommo- O’s idea of life(all laugh) but Drew especially said that unless bro feels that the person truly believes that he can change them for betterment in life not in battling(all laugh) then one will be praised to heaven(all laugh) with little changes here and there which themselves are good enough cause of that language(all laugh) and all these ideas are the little changes which none ever thought so(all laugh) but to him that is honestly dishonest hallucination(all laugh) cause he you know wants to sit on your shoulder and act as his Gengar do with you personally too(all laugh),anyway then I thought I too can do the dishonestly honest hallucinations(all laugh) so I said well Mehadi is too good and Mehadi will soon get the nomination and yeah Mehadi(all laugh) is a respected name now but Mehadi’s bunch(all laugh),Mehadi!Mehadi,Mehadi,Mehadi,Mehadi!(all laugh) as if in the whole world none other has that name(all laugh) what is that name,yeah Mehadi!(all laugh) and none else is a water pokemon trainer with that name(all laugh) what is it,yeah Mehadi!(all laugh) and no gym can be better or equal to that damn Cerulean(all laugh) cause who is the leader yeah Mehadi!(all laugh) don’t pester me by naming so and so whose name aptly suits her nature(all laugh) but yeah always skillfull with water pokemons beat me ages ago thrice good trainer nice person so nice and sweet little girl(all laugh) but gone to the bay cause suddenly had to think that she indeed is a girl(all burst into laughter) I said bro still said the name 8 times(all laugh) why not contact her for once(all laugh),cause 8 times the same times the infinity,I’m a boy and she’s a girl and thus it’s honestly immoral by all ethical standards to talk with a girl or a boy for no reason even being a girl or a boy ain’t it so Dave ain’t it(all burst into laughter) which made me realize that one sermon for 1.5 hours at his place when it’s 23:30-1(all laugh) was enough for a day as ISD charges are costly(all laugh) but Oscar’s full life along with his relationship status and how good his then fiancee was and yeah to bro girlfriend means fiancee so Mrs is definitely usable(all laugh) and Mr and Mrs Slate’s full life was foisted upon me(all laugh) and then with Brock as well whom he hadn’t talked to since the end of Kanto cause he changed profession(all laugh) but still without him he would’ve never been able to complete his first region itself(all laugh) and yeah Daisy was namecalled(all laugh) without her he would’ve had to quit the profession(all laugh) and Trace was mentioned as being just a great lab colleague actually only his skills never the relations just said Pasio travel compnaion and like Brock much help then got infatuated with Professor(all laugh) and Oscar was babysitted to heaven as to as I said this and this I did he played the role of Oscar and was trying to gauge what Oscar could do better which I said I’ve been asked midmatch umpteenth times from the devil himself(all laugh) then said sweet kids sweet litlle kids(all laugh) but how was my dear little bro in the match(all laugh) I said well he went with Regirock(all laugh) so I went with Aurorus(all laugh) took 29 minutes(all laugh) Aurorus won but was extremely hard match anyway then he goes with Ultranercozma(all laugh) so Aurorus stood about 18 minutes then I went with Diancie(all laugh) this still took 32 minutes more(all laugh) but yeah Diancie being Diancie still wins(all laugh) then he went with TYRAniTAR(all laugh),was it his or his eldest bro’s(all laugh),I said yeah his bro’s(all laugh) cause he said his caught a bit of cold(all brust into laughter) then my bro says,well bad luck you know previous gym leader means the brat was bloddthirsty(all laugh) and saw how grand a strategy cause knew your brat was tired but Diancies are extremely wicked pros(all laugh) ..**


so also a good twist for the next brat now cause dark is advantage and thus wants to get your Diancie to take it easy but that natural Tyranitar rage given your brat’s tiredness will only work in favour of Tyranitar as the dark type ensures he doesn’t give up at all till next to next life(all laugh),I said yeah he agreed on both but after going full on with Ultranercozma vs Diancie said steel types these days don’t like to keep bandages for long you know(all burst into laughter) I realized his own professionality with his two elder bro’s naivety mixed has created a truly unique sample(all laugh) anyway then Tyranitar vs Diancie took about 14 minutes then finally I go with Tryrantum(all laugh),..**


yeah a great choise with toe to toe by all means Tyranitars are not dragons only in the books(all laugh) but Tryrantums are even more outragious than Tyranitars(all laugh) so yeah the type independence will disadvantage the brat now cause it’s about just their nature and dragons will always hold advantage in such cases exactly why Tryrantum is a dragon yet Tyranitar isn’t(all laugh)..unless he is irresponsible(all laugh) which isn’t the case given his eldest bro’s feelings(all laugh),anyway but here comes Tyranitar’s extra pseudo-legend capasity so basically it’s a dragon vs a dark without objective pokemons(all brust into laughter) so now it’s a great game really Dave you will let him attack cause you can’t attack as the dark may create advantage yet if you do you will be restrained feeding Tyranitar more ego now he will try to reverse it upon you being dark and here you will show your dragonic nature by raising your ego even more by defending the dark it with dragonic nature now dragon isn’t exactly a type as you know(all laugh) so yeah the balance is brilliant Dave you excite me honey(all brust into laughter)..no sometimes did talk like that unknowingly as you know during undercover cause to him I was just about able to walk(all laugh),so I said then what to you is dragonic nature cause your dragons haven’t been seen in last 2322 years(all laugh)..no years are just a count you know anyone can get to what I’m doing with them or the moon(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “atleast I didn’t say wait till we go above(all laugh)..” David(laugh) : “no among humans(all laugh)..no I’ve been here for just around 2 years and already Trace is a topic of getting moods light literally(all laugh,Seth cheers for OH MY DEAR DASE,LOOK AT THE MOON,I’M THE TRACEY THAT WITHSTANDS THE CURSE OF THAT SUBTLE BOON,all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..man indeed I wouldn’t have been to office tomoroow(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “no these two little brats are not at all CULTURED(all laugh)..” David(laugh) : “man this is outragious stuff by all means(all laugh)..anyway,so now I said what would you have done in my position,would’ve went with Heatmore what else(all brust into laughter) why disturb why try to battle whose already a bit tired that’s inhuman Dave(Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs,all brust into laughter and cheers for AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!,all laugh even more)..Heatmore life says if you are happy I’m not(all laugh) if your’e not I’m happy(all laugh) if your neutral I’m unstable(all laugh) so a tired pokemon isn’t of any use if totally type advantaged especially isn’t it Dave(all laugh),I said if Heatmore was the fresh opponent who,Vilemplume why(all brust into laughter),cause Vileplumian life is if you’re happy so am I a person is sad it’s all cause he wants to be happy hence he isn’t(all brust into laughter)..,I said how would you have defended against first Heatmore then Tyranitar too with Vileplume cause that logic is similarly feasible(all laugh),why should I be bothered about it if it’s not my body only mind(all burst into laughter) Plumie will get the job done by herself why bother with that anyway what is that beam that book says all poison types have(all burst into laughter),I said well first I realize why only your family could beat you(all laugh) and Melody too in a way cause you know bro ever says I missed my little sis there so we just hope we will get back to her which Trace has as usual already paved the path to(all laugh) then I asked bro you’re a 6 time champ in last region having oversaw Crawdauntogator of all brats doing the exact same to the Team Rocket boss of all people in his most desperate mood(all laugh),how can you not know about what beams your Vileplume has that you got in your very first region 19/20 years back(all laugh) no it’s ok I do know that no matter what Vileplume herself surely does(all laugh) but still how have you defended all along(all laugh), a pokemon attacks with a certain attack Dave cause he doesn’t know what to do if he doesn’t(all brust into laughter) exactly why he has that attack(all brust into laughter) I only work cause I don’t know what is whhat if I don’t exactly why I have to to define it isn’t it(all brust into laughter)..I said yeah I get you(all laugh),cause.) at undercover once that brat was against of all brats a Reshiram(all laugh) and scared him away then Bulby did the same to a Zekrom(all laugh) and yeah Heatmore scared off a Tryrantum(all laugh) and in-between was leg pulling with their knowledge on fire and electric types that due to translators were most abstrucely dense(all laugh)..**..Vileplume,Bulbasaur,Heatmore..**


anyway,then I said yeah thankfully my Vileplume is still sane cause I didn’t use her against a Tyranitar of all brats(all laugh) and thank God I don’t have a Heatmore(all laugh) anyway then Tyranitar vs Tryrantum took 39 more minutes so the total match took 136 minutes just about the last limit but somehow my Tryrantum managed to outlast Tyranitar atleast so he thought too(all burst..)..then Tyranitar rather joined him in hospital(all laugh)..just as it was to be counted out at the last limit this horrendous dark menace wakes up zaps to my poor Tryrantum saying yeah compeer forgot to add we heard somewhere compeer as a term must be enveloped for randomness as well we heard, compeer : the random limit(all un..,..Guzzle Humdrum,#,..)..i said then itself that well we read it too you know but not randomly(all un..,..A Random Tryrantum,#,..)..thankfully mine was a Tryrantum not a Random Run(all un..,..Guzzle Humdrum,#,..)..so#..my Tryrantum realized that this brat can go on for 136 minutes again so returnd to my ball himself which proved my forever suspicion why none beats Osckie except exactly as bro's career began but for Oskie it's only one defeat this was the same opponent but not official i later asked him why did you lose said no that feeling you know i we were told battle that meaning(all un..long,..Seth+Mehadi..Dashin' Rock,all un..,#,..Brock too un..)..anyway#..then i asked bro so why only Oskie managed but Florie is so normal unlike your case as a few brats tell me(all laugh..lot,..Baby Gyarados,#,..Mehadi laughs a lot in silence)..said no they're about one me and Mehu is about pun hence(all un..,..The Darkened Ones,#,..Seth+Mehadi too un..)..so i then said shouldn't you call then like Oskie,no Florie called him always that's where the difference is,i said gym leading is way more routined,so?do i have to confess my longing for mentioned crows(all un..long,..The Darkened Ones,#,..Seth+Mehadi too un..)..so#..i realized it's futile for situations nothing else(all laugh..lot)..anyway i told bro that but the professional said you know Tryrantum could’ve beaten me ages ago my Tyranitar didn’t allow it to happen from this minute this second to this I was lost despite my Tyranitar’s tiredness giving me enough an incentive to stay focused(all laugh) I said man give a respite to the world accepting hall of fame all suspects still the reality you know too that you're the junior version of Seth along with your baby sis(all laugh),no may be you know he's my elder bro Brock didn't have the inklings really(all laugh..lot),i said yeah i see how Scrafty works(all laugh..lot)..the younger version will come later it's a full novel really(all laugh..lot..,The Effusive Entropy,#,..)..so i told Oskie if you were 5 years more into this I would’ve been beaten long before you released your Tyranitar who still isn’t your own(all laugh),um no it’s the same mine is a bit personal if professionally injured(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) ..I said yeah I get it(all laugh) then asked are you married(all laugh),um,no not yet my fiancee hasn’t completed her journey yet always wastes one month in breaks(all laugh),and I’m a stranger and comes this cause it’s(all cheers for DIALGA DON’T BE A GAMBLER JUST SPIN THE WHEEL/WHEN A BRAT CHALLENGES THINK OF HIS CAREER AND PUT UP THE LOOK OF THAT PEWTER STEEL,all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)..man if you said it to Dialga would’ve been something else(all laugh) by the end told me like whose your beau bring each together immediately but what would that moment mean to them and you mentally though(all brust into laughter)..**(Dialga)


I said yeah will tell you next life(all laugh) anyway then about the Azumarill never FiniRina(all laugh),I said,yeah best of luck to your fiancee(all laugh) then bro said,sweet kids you know Dave the fiancee is water type specialist Flores Dybert her name just too good and ever completes her travels in minimum time may be a month or so left these two makes perfect match nice family know both of them for so long kids grow up so fast you know like you’ve since undercover Dave you were so sweet little kid there with such sweet little feets and cute little fingers used to walk with little steps crawl on my lap now grown up going to school so deepening is this age of mine(all brust into laughter),I said yeah I understand(all laugh)..but Oskie and Gemmie are rather the suspects why they don't admit that they're same as you like Dawnny(all laugh..lot)..,said no Dawnny doesn't admit it either cause she's the only one whom i never battled Oskie and Gemmie i did battle not with them their bunch and my bunch we were only analyzing them the battle was that who could go on longer Gary didn't like it you know Lillie flower would've hang on..sometimes i feel Doctor Stale expounded that distance may be the need of neigh..liquidation of shy..indeed..ok sent(all un..long,Lillie..Playboy Contents,#,..)..so#..then says..ok i did battle but Dawnny like if it was told like my opponent with be baby Dawn then battling well couldn't you know(all burst..,Dawn..bro would you practice with me,yeah sure..,ok Spritie,greetings compeer what may have been mine i heard it as thine like..as this line concluded..needy needy sphere/oh breezy breezy stare/oh bounce bounce rare/thus Dawnny what's trier,all un..long,..Colony Monogram,#,..)..so#..anyway i realized it too#..then i to poke bro said but um comparing with Cerulean this match..(all laugh),yeah yeah Cerulean isn’t it Cerulean(all laugh),that namecalled city was the reason why Mehu has rejected that so and so Waterflower(all brust into laughter) I said well can your wife come down to objectification to accept someone else(all laugh),why should I bother Dave the idea in abstraction no matter will still remain won’t it unlike the psychophysicality(all laugh),I said still won’t call her would you(all laugh),no cause psychophysically she thinks she’s a woman hence she’s not Mehu isn’t she so Dave isn’t she(all laugh) this actually was another day after my match with my sis here so I said yeah I’ve come to know that before though I don’t agree with you on the psychophysicality part at all cause she just may be thought that she has to remain a gym leader still(all laugh) and I realized this self created mess was troubling him only more only could be broken if he was WOKEN(all laugh) but anyway then I asked what are the right ways to get Aurorus,Tryrantum,Ultranercozma,Diancie,Terrakion and Regirock WOKEN(all laugh) but please don’t tell me about Tyranitar(all laugh) he said well,Regirock life is hardness of emotions(all burst into laughter) generally you feel as if something isn’t you especially when you’re emotional cause if that’s you then there no emotion is there(all laugh) thus in the reverse emotions are hard as to always you’re cautious about the other to make the difference to be emotional actually emotions starts from the idea of interaction you get emotional feeling yourself after birth thus you cry who am I ain’t it so(all laugh) thus you see this actually confuses a Regirock most that why would I be emotional of the other YET not kill of off mercilessly(all laugh) thus you have to break the idea of the other of a Regirock to get the Regirock to be WOKEN(all laugh) thus when you go to catch one you must loudly call your own bunch who must reciprocate and thus create a mess there(all laugh) this sounds and all disturbances will get the Regirocks to be emotional(all laugh) hence they will try to kill you exactly when you must ask your bunch as to why they respond to their specific names only never the other(all brust into laughter) then you must ask the marauding Regirock gang that why your bunch wasn’t talking when you were questioning them but now doing so cause if they disturbed you then you would never have been able to question thus why they have just inflicted this pain of thought upon them(all brust into laughter) this will get the Regirock herd to be thoughtful cause this means prevention is better than cure thus when they see you they must kill you instantly exatly what Salamences wants to do(all laugh) but Salamences does so cause they don’t understand why you will be different to them while Regirocks are ok with it but they ask why would you exist at all alongside them(all brust into laughter) thus they actually are more thoughtful(all laugh) so you can tell a Salamence that you have a knee joint pain then Salamences will realize they must kill themselves off first cause they themselves are the trouble to them being another to begin with exactly like you but will do so if only you do it to you as much as you can leading the way(all laugh) so that you lessen their burden of killing you that is(all laugh)so now as Regirocks are thoughtful as is your bunch you must ask both sets that now that both are thoughtful where’s you(all laugh) both thus will realize that you are only an idea to them that they are being too attached too your bunch more the Regirock herd less thus your bunch will try to search you beyond you in psychic channels that is(all laugh) thus the Regirock herd is even more thoughtful as to thus they can get rid of this idea of emotions VIA you killing you off that is(all laugh) thus a few chosen ones among them will talk with your bunch then join them in your process then may be one will get in along with them to become your bunch cause to him or her you are a medium to get rid of his emotion by removing the cause that is the difference with the other that is actually he or she himself or herself cause you must before allowing the brat to join ask him why are you here due to me or you yourself(all laugh) so thus the trouble is all about him and is only following you cause you’re in similar pursuit thus a good compeer exactly what your brats are thus you should be able to get a Regirock not tame them though this is just step 0(all brust into laughter) then step one is to ask them what makes a confinement from cyclic to become spherical(all brust into laughter) spherical confinement is that of ideas and emotions and so on no matter the diameter the things are same in may be infinite many dimensions as well but the cycle in 2 dimensional yes or no why do you but ask if you know the only reason the truth value exists is cause you want it to be to know what’s not you like your sanity(all brust into laughter) thus you ask am I sane and then get the answer from others how do they know your sanity(all laugh) thus at this step one Regirock will be very suspicious of you(all laugh) as to why you are at all existing yourself(all laugh) thus will fondle your psychic channles even more to the limitless utmost(all laugh) then when you realize that he has reached the stage that says you exist cause he wants you to to get an assurence that he too exists(all laugh) will you go to step 2 the final and ask him why is does he try to be if he already knows all he will in the end again have to say that it’s just me(all brust into laughter) thus he will now realize that he isn’t helping himself at all forgetting his basic that he’s he so he will now try to get rid of himself by getting rid of his emotions of himself the thought of being he will pester him beyond any limits thus he will be incensed with the whole world that’s just he cause if the world isn’t he then how can he say it’s just not me(all laugh) so thus he will ever be too eager to get rid of his idea of being him and his process will be to get rid of anything that tells him he must be a Regirock and not Lycanroc(all laugh) thus he will get dissolved into your bunch by killing them off that is mentally(all laugh) thus he will be one in many and many in one thus finally he won’t find you or him thus too happily will get WOKEN(all laugh) did you understand this life of hard emotions Dave(all laugh) I said yeah when I was with Bulbasur yeah(all laugh) then he says next comes Terrakion who says this earth,this sun/this rock so barren,cause I’ve killed everyone on it thus no more of that fun(all laugh)/thus on this very day,why did you stop here say(all laugh)/look a rock is just here,why don’t you want me throw it in your way(all laugh)/this life,fighting on this unyielding rock(all laugh)/makes me so hungry,please give me more mental food to knock(all laugh)/see this hunger to be free from being free(all burst into laughter)/thus now you’re here,please allow me to eat up thee(all laugh) so you see they are thoughtfully incuisitive as to not what is life nor why their sepcific life but why is life in bondage of freedom(all brust into laughter) cause if you want to live you want to be free exactly why you’re not aren’t you(all brust into laughter) then if you think you’re free then you’re happy cause you think you’re no more in bondgae thus how have you become free at all of this very thought of freedom(all brust into laughter) thus to catch and then tame a Terrakion then getting it to be WOKEN you must do these->
Mr TerraKion(all laugh)?
while practicing deeply with my brats who wants to know the methods to cut of the chain of wisdom of being sane(all brust into laughter) the Insight that has got to Us so far is that if we’ve suddenly discovered that all of the ideas abstract or concrete equally empty cause they are produced by us only to be us by not being them in increasing levels of subtlity is no good at all cause with this reAlissation you want to find then what’s exactly you exactly why you’ve started this very procedure haven’t you(all brust into laughter),then your Terrakion if has the material will answer to now help you in his own path to that maddening tune(all laugh) saying-> look lad(all laugh),this idea of having an idea itself is of no essence cause it only is a chain that tells you thus this isn’t me hence what’s left isn’t EMPTY(all laugh) but this emptiness or lack of definition whaich is the delusion actually is not other than the very definition itself only cause you think you’re you hence your trouble starts but if you know that already why you ask again is that you know it to begin begin with knowledge must be substantiated with the fulcrum of knowledge itself that will then become the object you know you’re you cause you want to know to begin with don’t you whether you’re you(all burst into laughter) hence you try to be conscious of it each moment hence must validate what’s not being unconscious of it is thus this trouble of yours with yourself isn’t it(all laugh) then you must tell him that incredible Mr TerraKion(all laugh) as you said,all phenomena bear the mark of not being me cause of me(all laugh),their true nature is the nature of
no Birth no Death,
no Being no Non-being,
no Defilement no Purity,
no Increasing no Decreasing.

“That is why in Emptiness,
Body, Feelings, Perceptions,
Mental Formations and Consciousness are not separate self entities.

The Eighteen Realms of Phenomena which are the six Sense Organs, the six Sense Objects,
and the six Consciousnesses
are also not separate self entities.

The Twelve Links of Interdependent Arising and their Extinction are also not separate self entities.
Ill-being, the Causes of Ill-being,
the End of Ill-being, the Path,
insight and attainment,
are also not separate self entities.

Whoever can see this
no longer needs anything to attain.

Bodhisattvas who practice
the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore see no more obstacles in their mind, and because there are no more obstacles in their mind,
they can overcome all fear,
destroy all wrong perceptions
and realize Perfect Nirvana.


And then Brawn(all laugh) said such a man should be given a separate place in history and fame who inspires all to lead a life of a happiest ghost type(all laugh) I said yeah like Gengar(all laugh) said yeah I agree Gengar’s have only one partner for life or stay alone similarly happy in both cases(all laugh) but that match was philosophically discussed(all laugh) Brawn I knew would be 1 on 1(all laugh) so I chose Rotom(all laugh) cause Brawn chose Oricorio(all burst into laughter) then said just watch the fun as my brat loses his temper being a psychic unlike yours in the course of ghostly games(all burst into laughter) I understood I’ve entered school again(all laugh),so the match took 56 minutes of 56(all laugh) cause the Oricorio himself was exactly Brawn(all laugh) somehow won then went to centre exactly 3 seconds later and Brawn was happier than me with my win(all laugh) I said I just marginally won,said Ah kid why bother about certain gym brats(all laugh) just get to that platform in the final and just say didn’t you promise yourself that I will definitely get back to place once more with my beau thus why are you standing alone look here’s my beau show the ring and say I’m married for 2 years more or less or a minute to you na na(all brust into laughter) I said yeah thank God you’re not a general trainer cause your nepheew already is(all laugh),but surely i had to go to Gemmi's gym none calls that city by name(all laugh..lot)..,challenger centre registers go out,come in come in come in(all burst..)..i said um..hallow,how did you know what to say if you didn't me just that i was something you related to(all un..,..The Effusion of Effects)..so i knew that my day was ruined(all laugh..lot)..then Gemmie takes me to the gym there's a special way through the reservation to battlefield where she asks which brat will come(all laugh..lot)..and goes like dancing..
pity piety to a city/oh whose who/trying mine/oh left or who will cue..
we we we we ah forlorn if i/oh spur Meh boo Blurred why I..
ei Dave why don't you ask them who can battle for you like
kitty gritty nice and for some thing/mind oh ok no thoughts mine pinged..
mine mine drown under oh thing/left alone you who focus..bludgeoned mean..
oh so you like surprizes why why why(all un..long,..The Effusion Effect,all un..lot)..
i said it must be difficult for you to handle gyms alone(all laugh..lot),no Condire battles always i'm never allowed to unless the challenger centre thinks fit(all burst..),i said i wonder how you finished your journey#,no Condrie did i was taken to places why(all burst..,The Cognized Ones,#,..)..so#..i asked do you know my identity that i was with Seth during undercover Oskie didn't but here the challenger centre is handled by Zed so it was learnt from our conversations(all laugh..lot,..Vagabond of Usage,#,..),yeah i wanted to go too with Oskie bro didn't like that you know for some reason and that brat Brock supported him we that's why Viol didn't like him when he used to travel(all burst..)..i said but well your career matches with your elder bro's i know the outcome of this match anyway and the fact why you haven't aged after 5(all laugh..lot),oh you count from start too not from waking up(all un..,The Effusion Effect,#,..),i said i give up(all laugh..lot)..then i said well it's strange why people don't recognize you as similar to like Seth,no when i won some cups they introduced me to this idea again i said it's like passing why(all un..long,The Effusion Effect,#,..),so i said what was the specialty of Mr Conrad#..,no not like that Condrie was beside me when i found something other than mine which he confirmed that as one we couldn't be in what was appearing as also why(all un..long..,..The Cognized Ones,#,..)..so i said yeah about him all knows too why he never loses unless the challenger is just about getting started but never wins either unless the challenger is not enthused but excited(all laugh..lot)..anyway then had to battle this sort of a pest(all laugh..lot)..
so to battle me actually it's 6 on 6 with truncated time(all burst..)..referee is only Condrie(all laugh..lot)..,yeah Mr Nofcun i thought of battling you but Gemmie didn't like her Gigalith's mood today too vested in doing rather than seeing so came(all un..)..i said can i quit(all laugh..)..so it's Gigalith,Carbink,Boldore,Slugma(all laugh..)..then still Klefki and Phampy(all laugh..lot)..all were exactly as their master pest(all laugh..lot)..the moods were like they didn't like something neither did their master so some authentic food was to be served to discuss their reasoning(all un..long,..The Effusion Effect,#,..)..later i learnt that she's debarred from battling officially unless already qualified or referred people for obvious reasons(all burst..)..thus battles hall of fame each day the only one who was given a hall of fame straight after first journey atleast the involuntary one finished the whole course then only got it no matter the choreography#.. all say this is a heinous game that Pewter Crook plays we tell you(all laugh..lot)..and Condire isn't any good a brat but a bit less effusive(all laugh..lot)..so their gym is completely managed by Zed always thus hands-on(all laugh..lot)..yeah had to face that menace too as i said before only stays at challenger centre the gym workers are monitored from reactions..need hands-on(all un..)..that is the brat to stratifies the incoming pack doesn't say much all know not to say much either(all laugh..lot,..Jubilee Hands-On)..so the problem is that all sorts or people queue up at the challenger's centre(all laugh..lot)..i get in didn't give my identity,yeah resume career ok i'm sorry compeer but are you a fan of this or an enthusiast of examination..no not the systematic one with machines rather what's expansion of how hands-on i mean(all un..long,..Jubilee Hands-On,#,..)..so i had to confess my identity cause without this surely Gemmie if faced the mental states of pokemons and masters will be in a may be incurable state#..The Effusion Effect,#,..and this brat always worked with whoever came to the gym some people tried to introduce to her the facts of illusion,oh you mean as i what may happen to why-then it was told may be usability or consciousness why(all un..long..,..The Effused Entropy,#,..)..so#..this pest was captured by Team Yell#..,oh you're trying for an alternative but then the other part is random why why why(all un..long,..The Effusion Effect,#,..)..they said we understood no foots will be able to return to a more rational state so kicked this pest out first hand(all laugh..lot)..The Professional is never mingled in these places obviously(all laugh..lot)..so yeah Ecruyoke is a completely different saga#..anyway so i told bro that it was useless after all these whom i used(all laugh..lot)..i understand that you and Gemmie certainly can't even reach a battlefield(all laugh..lot)..said no my niece(all laugh..lot)..has grown up much now you know i used to feed her and Oskie together telling them rhymes Condrie never would eat from my hands always from Zed's(all laugh..lot)..then Zed once told them to eat themselves i didn't like that you know why bother(all burst..)..i said yeah hence the condition(all laugh..lot)..and Condrie is circumspective so against you it will be that it won't be a battle rather discussion(all burst..)..said yeah i have 2 nephews but only one niece you know(all laugh..lot)..i said what about Mango,no he's relatively nephew not existentially there he's more like Dawnny only(all un..),i said is there anyone whose same as you i know the bigger baby bros like Drew and Johnny,ofcourse there's Mr Harris what wa..yeah Son(all un..,Seth&Harris un..) and yeah there's Mr Kane HALMSLY you know these men..shh.. is so reliable(all burst..,Kane&Harris&Seth un..long)..i said what about their(all laugh..lot)..no Brandie is so sweet like Jitters you know(all laugh..lot)..and no Mrs Halsmley is like Susan why(all laugh..lot)..i said yeah thus these two men are always called for by all for explanations(all laugh..lot,Kane&Seth&Harris un..)..but what about Yumie,well we can't talk about about our sweet little babies if they've been consigned to the elder generations you know Gary will know if he doesn't it his bunch will know right(all burst..,Kane&Seth&Harris..oh now seeing Mr..Hush..It then Oak,all un..,..Dr Oak Dr Oak..,Gary..Choiced Vultures,#,..)..i said yeah thus sweet little bigger sis(all laugh..lot,Seth..Lillie flower,Lillie laughs..lot)..,but yeah to enter Pewter i said why i was asked..,
oh i was born..by the need of/thus i took mine in the haste of/oh roaming then in the notions/oh found i..in oh one's usability's options..
yeah ofcourse like this it's an option like are you sure you're no more i why(all un..long,..Jolly On-Roam,#,..)..i said well Shopping Lessons were better than this(all burst..)..but were you told about these by this particular kind of situational duality#..Jolly On-Roam,#,..cause i hear it was like never found at home after was 3 that is after the day you were born(all laugh..lot)..,no young Charlie fostered me..shh..The Dutiful..shh..Might..shh..so young you see One if Mine(all un..long,..Ingemar+Blythe..Playboy Concerns,#,..Seth too un..)..anyway#..then bro ever knew will win Kalos(all laugh) and my stipulation for wanting to travel another region to complete was that if I lose that I’ll not get the rejected hall of fame just the special tag(all laugh) bro didn’t know this cause we suppressed that else with all his mental devastating condition after coming out of that mess,he would’ve created a mayhem(all laugh) and he himself scoffed the authority off by saying if he is forced to stay around Sinnoh Elite4 HQ for cases that have no
meaning then he will release his bunch in wild(all laugh) that meant whole world wild pokemons will get spoiled(all laugh) so they allowed him to go to Kalos and asked me if they were fondlingwith me then he will give Bulbasaur to me so I said no it’s alright I’ve a family now(all laugh) and that’s cause Bulbasaur will try to dictate my pace being leader and now he being alone and relieved off the duty mask(all laugh) neither his ways nor language nor ideas will be suitable in a civic room or to a sane person(all laugh) cause after I did my proposal undercover that is(all laugh) he told me you look serious today don’t you understand the difference is only in your ideas but never in actual between tickling of the suited one to the sweetened one(all burst into laughter) so I realized no wonder why this pest is the leader of the bachelor’s mess(all laugh) and now this meance was trying to forcefully admit me to his gang by trying to break up my marriage already(all laugh) and that too by giving the soulmate theory to confuse me even more(all laugh) and I too then in undercover thought even then only cause of such brats may be did bro’s marriage broke-off(all laugh) I came to know about sis next week actually to this(all laugh),anyway,then I manage to win Kanto he gets Kalos and he monitored me throughout the region as if he is influencing my game to an extent where I lose my individuality or not and so on this continued till final and I was being cheered up by his knowledge of Kommo-O(all laugh) and so on then I win after the final ends congratulates me then says this is my schedule of Elite4 and I saw absurdly incredible workload(all laugh) then later asked me what are the chains that they’ve put around you(all laugh) I said no I need to win 3 atleast and draw another atleast rather than 4 and 1(all laugh) said I see has Zara agreed(all laugh) I said yeah she’s ok with another year cause she knows me too well sadly(all laugh) said alright if you feel like not continuing or anything that is hindering your game and mental emotions(all laugh) then tell me except Lance I’ll see about rules(all laugh) and you know his schedule and the general hall of fame both groups infact were in HQ all together to take a picture with him(all laugh) and even Katya went there too zealous(all laugh) she spoiled me actually(all laugh) bro said I can’t appease all(all laugh) and was visiting gyms and only appeased the senior hall of fame(all laugh) still appeased 56 juniors in total(all laugh) and told me that his bunch can work independently and I knew they could do so during undercover 3 years back what to speak of now(all laugh) and yeah then could manage as well sadly(all laugh) but that is despite my wishes of course which was my apprehension(all laugh) but he couldn’t show that then his bunch would’ve been in danger cause it wasn’t a gym but a full packed stadium from 8 in the morning to 20:30 at night(all laugh) that fear now though has been removed(all laugh) they really are invincible now unless humans resort to that only eternal all weather option called the bottom line(all laugh) surely Dusknoir can’t solve this poverty(all laugh) so then that wasn’t the case so that he didn’t do(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “just an eloquent intervention(all laugh),here we’ve discussed about my final matches against Dillon and Patricia and Nigel of course(all laugh) so I will mention your final Kanto match as well(all laugh) make time like Dusky does(all laugh)..yeah I saw that actually live if time suited(all laugh) you know my finals were unfair on my opponents since Unova itself(all laugh) should’ve just let me travel the gyms and the region that’s all I wanted in Kalos atleast(all laugh),anyway,Dave is Dave as you know too sweetly reddened like his little sister-pester(all laugh) but is more matured about the costs of proposal(all laugh),actually I knew that given he is all fine would win Kanto cause once you’ve seen that hell of rockets you can win leagues in your dreams given you’re great to begin with and his bunch is exactly that so he did get out of the groups in flying colours then the knockouts were excellent and comprehensive victories as well,quarter finals was his toughest match actually against Preeda Mastom who was doing her 5th region a two time champ hence was pretty desperate(all laugh) is a great competitior anyway then that went onto the wire and Dave’s Dialga just got out by 10 seconds after the double count and after that I was kinda apprehensive realized first time what my bench ever thought(all laugh) and then after that I congratulated him and also told him I realized what die hard fans think(all laugh) he said yeah alright no trouble but had he lost would’ve been very sad for me but I had my plans ready to insinuate of course(all laugh) that I want a personal match with Dave using Lubos’s bunch(all laugh) and you know what happens then(all laugh) actually would’ve broken the myth that time that I could do anything with anyone’s bunch cause I can’t cause I can’t attack even rightly(all laugh) Solgaleo was asked 10000 times what is snarl blitz(all laugh) it’s ever the counter unless I’m shown something I can’t discover at all(all laugh) so anyway,Dave won was a very tough match against Preeda at quarters but that he did well and the great Dialga withstood the great Reshiram(all laugh),Preeda is ofcourse from Unova of all places(all laugh) won the Frontier there 4th region(all laugh) with the 3rd being the league there ofcourse(alllaugh),anyway,then semis were brilliant for Dave as well faced Phillip Opatumos,3rd region infact from Pasio and already a champ in Pasio itself had Palkia at first region at Pasio(all laugh) then was a good match,Phillip actually did brilliantly throughout won against some renowned advanced time champs back to back from last 32 and before that defeated another two 6 time champs in groups(all laugh) but the kid was a kid still(all laugh) so Dave won the semi comprehensively as well and then the quarter final actually I wanted to talk about but can’t remember anything except Reshiram vs Dialga(all laugh) was 8 on 8 in total,both Reshiram and Dialga were fresh and took 44 minutes(all laugh) total match,7 hours 6 minutes(all laugh) and in semi the last was Emboar vs Groudon actually Phillip’s Groudon was a great match for more than 20 minutes and Emboar again just won but Groudon was Phillip’s last Emboar had a backup still(all laugh) so you realize how great Dave was in that match(all laugh) and no I hope people have appreciated the fact that that year Kalos final holiday was postponed hence that wasn’t played on the same day of the biggest draw in quite a few years that’s David vs Iris as the title goes(all laugh)..it was billed as David vs Galaxy part 2 which that brat herself promulgated the most(all laugh)..all told me it won’t matter if we don’t declare both as holidays you know none’s coming anyway including us(all laugh)..so Dave bro vs Irissalad was as usual played till the next day when I sweared each to hold my match the day after else I’ll show up in all the remaining finals and also each of Kalos Elite4 boss’ washrooms at night with Sawk,Throw,Zacian and Zamazenta and hold a contest in-between them as the the target singular or plural being the ref(all laugh a lot) but Dave vs Iris was something else as well I was at a dragon gym at Unova though on the second day just about returned sanely before tv before last round Goodra vs Goodra with Goodie to review still(all laugh) but the first day infact sent me back to the days of Sakura vs Katya and Mrs Jolum vs Simon(all laugh)?


Dave about the fear of termination now they must involve military cause with Percy and Nigel atleast Kalos isn’t anyway budging and whole Unova general government is going to resist it now with two strongest militaries out it’s not going to help the others cause using my citizenship I will hide around Huntelion to begin with(all laugh) and atleast Cerulean city isn’t going to allow brats to hunt the gym down cause it’s rather a matter of prestige to them now(all laugh) out of the militaries the great Unovan General Govenrment is wholeheartedly in my support as they have realized what risk they were at without much knowledge and thus Marc is even more incensed with more regulations(all laugh) Kalos general government did you me of course(all laugh) so now with the insinuations from Percy and Nigel has become a mute spectator won’t do anything at all(all laugh) hence both are rather neutralized so I have a huge support base there and Sinnoh you know all our puppets(all laugh) so that we can atleast stops buffoons from jumping now the left is Hoenn,Pasio,Johto and our beloved Kanto of course the most suspicion arises from where(all laugh) well Pasio is in a way similar to Johto now Nancy is there afterall in hall of fame(all laugh) then there’s beautiful men who has made the rangers too happy now empowering them(all laugh) so in a way something can be said there then Kanto same we live here of course(all laugh) then there’s Johto and Hoenn and actually Johto Elite4 is ever mumb(all laugh) and only Hoenn is left who are petrified at the prospect of going against Unova of all places(all laugh) so it’s just a game with our beloved Johto(all laugh) sweet sweet Cynthia(all laugh) anyway,then no more interveneing but still man in Unova my brats didn’t let me sleep even unlike Cynthia’s(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “hence should’ve dragged Trace along with you the horizon is ever so confining(all laugh),and well my longest match was against Percy of all people at Pasio(all laugh) took 9 hours 5 minutes total 12:35(all laugh) then was so happy long match said which are longest so saw
...................................bro’s list Regice vs Muk(all laugh) and before that was Latias vs Muk(all laugh)..”
...................................
Seth(laugh) : “just a sec my Pasio journey was about..” All in Unison except David,Seth stops Mehadi from talking  er very firmly and laughs(laugh) : “toffee-flower(all laugh)”
Mehadi(frown,irritated,same pose,Seth laughs in same pose tendering her) : “shut up you namecalls(all laugh) don’t poke my hubby and don’t spoil my sweet little bro(all laugh)”
Seth(laugh) : “well I can barely resist just that age(all laugh) really Dave we two were something there as much that even Trace of all people fled the scene next region till the very end(all laugh) anyway sorry man continute(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “well atleast you’ve created a path of reinvigoration each moment(all laugh) so yeah this is great stuff(all laugh)..actually bro should be known for this as well(all laugh) cause of the insinuating prospects of the grand Squirtle dictum means Zara will have less cases on honesty more on morality(all laugh a lot) but just the ideal only if all could become Emboar(all laugh) but the biggest thing is what is now being forcefully spoonfed to the Pasios is what Palkia claims to have unearthed don’t try to know the falsity of anything including the idea unless you know the truth(all laugh) thus no attempt is made what-so-ever towards the confession process from any corner cause last time I spoke with those men said you know Mr Nofcun this idea that we have that we want to be friends or colleagues are cause of our liking for the persons not so much the work cause that would’ve been anyway done by another thus it’s a lie ain’t it friendship or being colleagues in office with particulars(all brust into laughter) I said yeah I understand the condition of sea beaches there(all laugh) and bro is known since Kanto itself and the translators with his question trainings whole world knows(all laugh) but I was thinking alright how good he might be(all laugh) I ever thought that till his meeting very first with me before undercover, greets my brat,Ms SalaMence please make yourself comfortable
in this conference of ours(all burst into laughter) then says Meancy(all laugh),nice to meet you(all laugh),’EUREKA(all burst into laughter) if ‘to’ is extracted then the words make no meaning why this urge to be social if only to be individual(all brust into laughter)’..then I fully realize why Feraligator and all did what they did to my brats at Unova dancing to that maddening tune(all laugh)..anyway,then I entered Elite4 and then I knew all main Elite4 heads and everyone
else of course as well compeer Jasu and Stu McShin(all laugh) then I get my schedule Lance at 3,Percy at 4,Lubos at 6(all laugh) and Percy as you know the office pressure is hindering him though way less now but after the lure machine bid is driven here(all laugh) we’re getting a new Lance(all laugh) and Marc both me and bro have faced as much dangerous and lost to Percy twice rest equally shared but those two both were runners up level at league finals(all laugh) and he knows that Kommo-O is a fly/water type whose evolved form is Swanna(all laugh) and still both Jasu and McShin are lunatic battlers(all laugh) so 5-2 means 9-0 now(all laugh) hopefully Marc is at total bay and McShin is in total mess to get the two down much and still our sweet sweet Jasu is there(all laugh) and still had to face Sakura at no 2 forever there(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “well hang on a minute cause she said your bro was way better than me at each stage of his career Percy cheats all knows forget him(all laugh and cheers for David)” David(laugh) : “well I infact asked Sakura why don’t you come over here or even explore your Hazelex atleast(all laugh),says no your sweet cute family are utter brats(all laugh) anyway the fact is that the deputy head at Kalos is just Nigel(all laugh) Percy and Marc are at the same level then Nigel and Sakura draw then Jasu and McShin then Monkhbat and Nancy again draw(all laugh) and both Jasu and McShin is as good as Nigel who ever said those brats the much burden the better cause they are lunatics(all laugh) but none wants to talk about obviously Mr The Marc Litman(all laugh) not even Sakura of all people(all laugh) said no Dave it’s about mental sability(all laugh) atleast I didn’t ask the ref if the other half was a trainer(all burst into laughter) only Percy gets under his skin sometimes but Iris all time now(all laugh) and Percy does it using the two final losses one had to be bro other had to be better head to head(all laugh) but last 3 all were abject failures for Percy against him(all laugh) so has got the ground of outside equal and Percy says you know this brat is strange when there wasn’t any burden was rather thoughtful so fumbled sometimes in Palkia vs Rampardos(all burst into laughter) but now his own disposition is scraing my brats(all laugh) still you know I understand doesn’t want responsibility what the hell is he Dave(all laugh) I said those who punches their beau to confess what does this moment mean to you(all burst into laughter) he said yeah Kommo-O and your family has a few(all laugh) I said yeah one did what I just told you(all laugh) he said if I tried this would’ve jumped me you know anyone goes at my home,um..how many times did you see a match(all laugh) man this stuff that pest Dialga himself told me after getting mad during undercover,knew both me and Zara one day asks me Mr Nofcun this is a not male what does this now mean to you mentally don’t get me wrong Mr Nofcun answer me without emotional attachment what does this statement mean to you as well mentally that is(all brust into laughter),I told bro man just get rid of these menaces after we get out these are damn dragons(all laugh) and Nigel says,if Marc is released then it’s going to be very hard to get to hall of fame(all laugh) well currently Percy and Marc are tied at 3,Iris and Sakura at 2(all laugh)..and no Iris is something else now as you know too sweet a kid(all laugh) well smoothness means I’m her way bigger bro but my big bro is her twin(all laugh) and Sakura has been too happy since that final anyway says,no you know till then I had a system a point of view but those 10 brats just laughed at it(all laugh) hence I had to become WOKEN(all laugh),well bro didn’t face Sakura in a official match as you know(all laugh),just had set the Philosophy 5 upon her personally(all laugh) and then Cladlie and Scarlie at 3 still joint(all laugh),then Jasu and McShin had to be together at 4(all laugh) then Nigel and Japp at 6 and then Pulu and Ritch at 7 unfortunately joint still is at each other’s throat and Ricth’s beau is a trainer so Pulu is still in disadvantage says that brat tortured my wife out of profession(all laugh) then Nancy and Joel at 8,Dillon and Monkhbat at 9,then comes Ivana at 10(all laugh) whose joint with Patricia(all laugh) and finally Cynthia and Wendy of all sweet sweet persons joint at 11(all laugh) so yeah total 19 max selectable in top 10 all filled(all laugh) and the 11th spot too infact Cynthia of all people at 11 is strange(all laugh) and same for Wendy hence both are all the more miffed with bro(all laugh) and no my ranking being 1 has a lot to do with my bro’s bunch as well man what ideas they feed my poor kids(all laugh) and yeah there’s an honourable mention that Zed isn’t subject to any of this(all laugh),still says they should’ve let me have my real career you know it just got away from my grasp that spanner(all laugh),anyway,today itself that brat Bisharp told my Noivern of all brats(all laugh) told you see you have legs and wings for different reasons to achieve the same in the same body what’s the use(all brust into laughter) thus if one challenges you he wants to beat you to win the subject of which is only him thus the joy of winning and the suspence of the process negate each other my dear little girl thus what’s the point to think you or your master brat can battle the other or each and other(all brust into laughter) Noivy came to me almost crying(all laugh) said these goons are HUMAN(all laugh) I said yeah I wholeheartedly agree(all laugh) man no legends can tolerate this line by any means(all laugh) and the only way out of this is to become a pest but I realized it’s not happening in a million years cause as my Meancy said just thank you bro says EUREKA(all laugh) means bro and bunch only is expecting a serious discussion what they do among themselves means there’s ever a draw at the cost of the referee(all laugh) and they ever advise my brats to turn on me(all laugh) so it’s just so maddening to unleash them now(all laugh) anyway about Marc,Jasu and McShin well all three wants to get involved in everything cause all is battle to them and Jasu most hence so much moling bonhomie of sweetness(all laugh)..well,I’m no better than them either like bro was when he wasn’t hearing that maddening tune(all laugh) but we atleast don’t want to get involved in official matters(all laugh)..but just a bit bro,what’s the current lunacy level(all laugh) Seth(laugh) : “well,I only don’t officially battle hence travel around as Dragonite or Pelipper(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “that’s why the dragons aren’t happy at all cause only Rayquaza gets the leeway to pester all of them(all laugh)..anyway Lubos asked me are you happy with the schedule till your crowning cause you see it’s one man autocracy now waiting to hand you over the reigns while he retires to Marengo Forest only to re-emerge again in our happiest dreams if that’s at your cost(all laugh) I said yeah I have to be happy cause anyway I’ll get the double crown but is my other half revered too(all laugh) ENOUGH(all laugh) said yeah defintely general government is also interested cause of the money generated(all laugh) so then I win 2 then enter Lance’s den(all laugh) bro said man I can’t help you only on this Lance is such a cute little innocent kid of 65(all burst into laughter) I said why do you still stand on the patform(all laugh) said,no my brats otherwise will make the who place the battlefield leaving the crowd in danger thus me cause they want to intrude everyone now to increase the number games for greater fun(all laugh),then at Elite4s he also asked every details about my match and mood and everything else(all laugh) then said if a single hall of fame brat beat you and show as if he or she is better just give me the name what means pokemon training at 1:30 am in deep Marengo Forest Gengleye will show with most entertainment(all laugh) I said well we’ll see(all laugh)?


then you know with bro so much tirad has been propagated then too mostly at Pasio,Johto,Hoenn and Kalos and Hoenn was outside profession,inside people only saw the reality,Johto is halved in this regard and Pasio is just jealousy from many inside and ignorance from outside but Kalos is strange cause almost all of bro’s supporters are from outside(all laugh)..so after that press and all people asked me we see no point in entertaining him any further cause it’s a matter of entertainment to him having nothing to do now isn’t it(all laugh),so I actually was very angry and frustrated there at Kalos as you know so I just asked bro to send two specially designated pros once(all laugh),then told them see this is grossly the most powerfull why don’t you try him it’s called a Reshiram(all laugh) but he has much patience as you know(all laugh),then this is from Elite4 did something and was in hospital straight(all laugh) then they turn on me I released Zeky(all laugh) so 4 more went to hospital(all laugh) then they said finally yeah we understand why he acts like that(all laugh),I was still angry so said you’re forgetting his bunch isn’t the first in history(all laugh),then a few infact said why don’t you bring them up too,comes only Zed(all laugh) this was at Kalos too didn’t tell bro just came then told them to release their bunch 235 were released(all laugh) I was about to set my bunch upon them Zed said don’t bother then gets in nothing happens except physically(all laugh)?


then while I came to Kanto,inquired about Cerulean of course(all laugh) and then Mehadi was very seriously battling and was on her way getting the tag so I infact thought she might’ve moved on(all laugh) so was dissapointed(all laugh) and I told bro that just as a in between line stuff cause in Hoenn he was then was telling this to the whole world along with Hoopa and Uxie at press(all laugh) so I recuperate him(all laugh) that Mehadi is very serious now about the tag now and Mehadi is battling well I heard(all laugh),’yeah,yeah again that so and so(all laugh),Mehadi isn’t it Mehadi(all laugh) what’s the chosen name yeah,Mehadi(all laugh) what was Oracle that I heard first day on my journey yeah,Mehadi(all laugh),I’m all fine but then who is it that must be associeted with me yeah,Mehadi(all laugh) you see for a married person like you to talk about certain stars with tainted past is harmful to your mental well being thus affecting your other half just cut it(all burst into laughter)’,so I got first the number game again(all laugh) and then the inter spouse skirmish part only(all laugh) so I realized that his antics were getting more and more severe cause of that pain(all laugh) so said,no it’s just that to be honest she might’ve moved on that’s all what I’m saying as you get excited as soon as the name come up too much(all laugh),’yeah I understand my mistake with less dark skin(all laugh) I’m not marrying any girl in this life including Ms Mehadi Waterflower,part time gym leader(all laugh),Cerulean City that damn water gym REPLACING Daisy(all laugh) cause she and the rest are girls hence not Mehu(all burst into laughter)..’ then this is before Kalos so after that as I said that press came up and I knew all for that Kalos incident mostly(all laugh) and the whole world was wanting a piece of him and yet be afraid of him cause he did literally seem like a Gengar since Sinnoh to Johto(all laugh) anyway then we go to Kalos where we get our bond and then he enters Johto but me Unova(all laugh) and I also heard newses as did bro we both brushed them aside saying get the Kalos money involved if they are tickling you(all laugh) in Johto bro was doing imposible antics(all laugh) and kept telling us just a few more days of circus then I can retire with my bunch(all laugh) and we were getting babysitted for about 1.5 months by then(all laugh) and we just understood the break-up was too severe on him as I said so once Zara asked bro how are you living without Mehadi but with your Mehu(all laugh),well it’s just my bunch(all laugh) unless for humans Mehu will become my bunch thus better actually this idea of genderhood perishes you know just like in your case with your sweet little hubby(all laugh) yeah ever told her that or me the opposite gender(all laugh) so we realized we were indeed just 30+ in months that is(all laugh) and I did Kanto here as I told you heard Mehadi was battlig hard and all and that to me meant too happy now(all laugh) so we were more dissapointed(all laugh) and then that part goes then I go to Sinnoh finally then I won 4 so already was qualified just formalities were there(all laugh) and he goes to Pasio so he finished a month before me there and when I go to Pasio he was one month in Kanto and Pasio as usual did give him jerks(all laugh) and I know that special temporal sentence as well from the great rockets themselves(all laugh) he was saying first league here so many years later Lapras and all but his tone was dissapointing(all laugh) but in Pasio he didn’t show any outside symbols but that Kalos stuff came to an agreement so he mellowed down a bit in public but only for a few days(all laugh) and then he said I don’t want to do Kanto Lance is so sweet(all laugh) Lance coerced him in there(all laugh) and Kanto for bro really is something cause he knows Unova better that any humans cause he has known it from Kommo-O(all laugh) and next Kalos and Sinnoh similar Kalos just more gyms,Sinnoh more chosen brat valleys(all laugh) and undercover(all laugh) Kalos the universities of course(all laugh) and then he knows Kanto then Hoenn then Johto then Pasio last and Kanto is divided some people thinks he’s great some the opposite none neutral(all laugh) and so on so his antics at Kanto was maximum(all laugh) and that helped Lance then now us for sure(all laugh) and this goes on but then finally by then Mehadi was in hall of fame(all laugh) and hence there bro did so few gyms so by then the 2 new hall of fames were contacted by Platue themselves(all laugh) but bro disagreed before their replies(all laugh) said it’ll be humiliating to me much to my bunch’s liking(all laugh) and then Sabrina didn’t send her reply of course cause she knew her little bro is only dancing to that maddening tune(all laugh) so she was visited privately later(all laugh) no told me you know Dave the whole family has hostaged me to littlesist all of you forsaken brats(all laugh) always stayed here for a night after returning from each league and said this life of travelling around with wild brats you know sis why will it end(all laugh) I said unless you behave sanely I’ll kick you out TO THE CITY BARS CAUSE YOU WANT TO GO TO THE FOREST SO MADLY(all laugh) no bro told me of Sabrina that so sweet is my big sis just eat her up(all laugh) so she was once more eaten up during bro’s Kanto journey and then finally Mehadi was contacted and refused(all laugh) rest 3 were visited at night(all laugh) and we were interested to know what happens to Cerulean City Gym(all laugh) by then I knew about my little sis and well uncle himself invited and all that was ok as I heard but this was something and I surely knew that Mehadi wasn’t alright at all via my sources which are all over the world as part of undercover(all laugh) so then bro of course told that he isn’t visiting misbehaving gyms(all laugh) and Mehadi told playboy’s not allowed(all laugh) so I came to know that and in Kanto it was the peak of antics(all laugh) so both of us were dissapointed very much cause we just knew the eventual but he said may be after I see the future so we still tried to poke him(all laugh) thus again bro I asked so your date at Cerulean isn’t happeneing unless you wish then(all laugh),Dave don’t try me you know the reasons for 5 years now(all laugh),so I said bro in the whole world you only ever cared for one girl as your wife and this treatment does she deserve it after 22 years from you of all people who is all the same to the rest as ever think of that(all laugh),no you know I actually asked Hoopa about this(all brust into laughter) I asked him what is the difference between dissimilarity and difference(all burst into laughter) he said you see master brat this idea that you have that you can know what a thing means makes you to actually differ with yourself that a thing comes to you you want to know it but end up knowing it’s meaning not it thus you differ with yourself don’t you(all burst into laughter) and this idea you have that I’m this is your conviction that isn’t at all similar to your determination that I am myself hence I am this isn’t it why bang your head in this cycle of despair(all burst into laughter) thus you see difference and dissimilarity are ideas that ever counter themselves and each other thus if you have them you hardly can be free enough to be dancing to that maddening tune(all laugh) so you see Dave I realized that Mehu being so and then being something more both are of not much use hence if I’m Mehu and the viseversa then nothing exist hence it’s cool here before being born how did I know that my name won’t be Hoopa and his Seth(all brust into laughter) so I realized now sis is residing by means of Hoopa(all laugh) which isn’t at all appreciable to any of us(all laugh) I still remember bro was at Kukui lab with his bunch then after undercover I went there and this brat tells me you see Mr Nofcun this idea you have that you’re Mr Nofcun is only cause you have to be distinct from others ain’t it(all brust into laughter) at the same time you think you’re same as them hence is too happy being with them but again this to you only mean that you’re not sad being alone which means you’re barely happy with Mr Nofcun aren’t you cause you’ve meant yourself by him despite he meaning not you but he(all brust into laughter) I somehow managed to feed him my Porygon(all laugh) so these were going on and then Lance I contacted a few times he said it’ll bust after the final(all laugh) and so on and by then I was way more frank with Lance and Lubos as usual(all laugh) I said Lance you’re a sweet little innocent kid hence didn’t want to come or help me against you(all laugh) Lance was laughing so much said my number one spot has been secured in my 3 leftover years for sure now exactly why I coerced him in else certain words would’ve been associeted with me(all laugh) anyway,finally he finishes the Elite4 on the same month I do I was thinking on what whether I should get in the Elite4 office or not but pests were at me as usual why they too weren’t invited there on the final show as they couldn’t black tickets(all laugh) and so on finally call comes(all laugh and .)..and I so much recall that and since Kalos we ever called each other bro sometimes I big bro and he little bro and since Kalos itself he used to tell me about his whole life mentioning everything except exactly you all(all laugh) by calling names that is(all laugh) but abstractly I knew everything the names weren’t mentioned(all laugh) and our little sis was mentioned before that with a note that she isn’t a little girl anymore cause now a responsible old woman(all burst into laughter) I had by then realized that he only understands family realtions and nothing else(all laugh) and exactly why I was never said harsh words and babysitted me and Zara as well cause she also was like his sis(all laugh) but thankfully
unlike Drew(all laugh) so didn’t spew(all laugh) and I knew about his income and as well the similar expenditure which is escalating day by day to keep his bunch sanely lunatic by means of human labour(all laugh) and that’s exactly that(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and all that money and all were as usual channeled to places(all laugh) and I also was asked if all my incomes were ok or not and so on else he knew everyone everywhere(all laugh) and if he didn’t his bunch would’ve found them out at midnight(all laugh) and my uncle and aunt and Luc and Tayla as well did speak with him quite a few times they were also asked if I was getting too overzealous with things or not(all laugh) and later after we were brothers my family was very happy as well as they are about anything all time like Brawn(all laugh) then anyway,finally Lance gets the best seat for the circus(all laugh) and that match itself was something(all laugh) then call comes straight to Lubos I want lackies(all burst into laughter) Lubos said why,’um..well the wills and all my gifts I want to distribute among many be 1000 people who shaped my career and 1375 gyms as well’ now Lubos of course knew the whole world as did(all laugh) that it was 1377(all laugh) so Lubos said that the other gym(all laugh) no that’s a separate matter a bit fishy place(all laugh) need no know the activites there despite my endeavours(all laugh) then Lubos says your eternal lackie is here with his stooges(all laugh) then I get the call,’um..Dave listen my flower(all laugh) sorry Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum..um..(all laugh)..just beat it,I want to marry Mehu immediately(all laugh)..you know Dave finally finally,found indeed that namecalled Mehadi(all laugh) was only a veil of illusion on both me and my dear Mehu,Mehu is just that not that damn Mehadi cause namecall is a psychophysical mass of garbage(all laugh) and infact why I say even more is cause Zara was taught these by sis herself to get me(all laugh)..anyway,then,bro continues,Mehu isn’t a girl or a psychophysiomotional entity I finally absolutely realized(all laugh) she’s more my then me myself my dear soulmate(all laugh) and yeah she is afterall there beside with my bunch in Cerulean as well as my Mehadi..Mehu that is anyway(all laugh) so she isn’t happy at all without me and hence she just should be my wife right now(all laugh) and she has been in so much pain and still is and if any damn brat is currently with her I’ll see how long he stays sane when he becomes the roomate at Pogamobstrog,Kalos,to a college-bully Darkrai(all burst into laughter) and if any chosen ones have in this 5 years tried to look at Mehu then..(all laugh)..anyway,so don’t know the queue(all laugh) all I know is that she wasn’t married 3 months ago AND THAT’S ENOUGH TO GET HER DIVROCED(all burst into laughter)..Mehu will never be happy with another brat except me as I said WHY IS SHE NOT WITH ME NOW(all laugh)..anyway,thus NO WAY OUT(all laugh)..I’ll see how good in anatomy(all burst into laughter,.)..anyway thus can’t date(all laugh) thus each brat with their beaus and their brats(all laugh) must be hunted down immediately and if she is married recently how long what biography(all laugh) who if were are formers how they broke up(all burst into laughter) which damn family how met Mehu everything(all laugh) if goes out of our world’s jurisdiction I’m rich you know with Unova,Kalos and Sinnoh general governments too infatuated(all laugh) and then the rest my ghosts will see how MUCH is the LONGING(all laugh) when at 2 in the night a Reshiram asks of his whereabouts hanging from the ceiling(all brust into laughter) as Groudon hands them over the water bottle(all brust into laughter) and Kalos general government knows me pretty well cause of that press and especially for it if from there no brats will get to court even(all laugh) and even if they do the courtroom will host a Zekrom beside the witness box(all brust into laughter) and just my Mimik(all brust into laughter) and wherever the brats may be when the family is gifted two very special buddies of mine they surely won’t(all laugh) Heracross and Beeheeyem(all burst into laughter) and if out of profession I’ll see how they stay sane being lost at Lybostrafos Valley the very own homely den of Spiritomb(all laugh) and Confragigus knows Huntelion too well(all laugh) and both are school dropouts(all burst into laughter) and I’ve got Lance with me and Simon too but Kanto Elite4 is beautiful(all laugh) I said fine and then go and then he says but are you in service I said no first day out(all laugh) then scoffed at me saying just send the men my bunch works independently despite me and my location(all laugh) I told him it’s just your vultures here(all laugh) the smell isn’t good neither the flesh for long enjoyment(all laugh) anyway then both me and Zara apprise the budding Gengar bro(all laugh) that it’s definitely better to leave ghosts alone(all laugh) Zara before me said if you don’t I’ll get the divorce ready aginst any so and so cause the gym situation was of course very bad and the expolitation of expression card is only created for these situations(all burst into laughter) then Japp was in Kanto as well(all laugh) so he is told to force himself into Cerulean(all laugh) then Joel ofcourse(all laugh),um..Seth it’s ok but my only doubt is if she has already refused to invite you then may be it’s best if you play your games to hit that point else I don’t see how her hubby is cajoled out of that place cause given everything won’t leave the bedroom under biggest security in history anyway(all laugh) that brat is the one who supplied the gym match plans as you know one of the most wicked brats(all laugh) man Whitney says you know when proposed me told are you sure I like your cosmetics cause well no brand creates an exclusive pouch(all brust into laughter) yeah no wonder he’s our bro and no wonder Jasu is in such plight(all laugh) anyway Japp was still in Elite4s so couldn’t get involved much(all laugh) still went to Cerulean though as was in Kanto(all laugh) and then team is formed and Lance told Lubos to help couples reunite for a vacation(all laugh) Lubos said he knows about Sinnoh more than me(all laugh) and the Elite4 too than both you and me(all laugh) he can pick lackies and Percy is too much a fanboy now(all laugh) and mostly if he wants he can make my own office to kick me out of my cabin and help him to date his girlfriend exactly there in full comfort all he wants(all laugh) but what’s the pin that pierced the heart becoming an arrow of that type(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,now all are after me(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “Mr Oak if pierce is enough to express it why is it called pierced through(all burst into laughter)..” Lillie(laugh) : “and Mr Oak why does it pierce only the heart(all burst into laughter)” Gary(laugh) : “no you see this most odious pest got my wife totally spoiled and my nephews and nieces after foisting their parents down my throat to take care of and one isn't even in profession(all laugh..lot) and they do these with college bullies and exam fails(all laugh) and this is humiliation by all means of ME using MY(all laugh)” David(laugh) : “no really Gary,it’s hard now to desist(all laugh)..anyway,Lance said well about Kanto he was regretting that Kanto was his first region so hasn’t met many chosen ones(all laugh) thus in frontier could only do 72 hall of fames(all laugh) with 36 competitions(all laugh) and the arrow is that saw a certain picture of a certain Ms Mehadi Waterflower,hall of fame water gym here at Cerulean very recently inducted but the picture version was older thus may be a reminder of rather brighter times(all laugh) and thus was totally Mehadified for 30 minutes(all laugh) before this wanted to know 11 city circle gym history then Cerulean city said no knows the current gym leader without saying that who was his travel companion for very first 6 years of that age(all laugh) but that was so much familiarity that wanted to know everything about her afterwards(all laugh) she hasn’t been alright recently we suspect a case of long depression due to same familiarity of multiple years before Undercover(all laugh) then the picture then jumped me,my 16 year long girlfriend since the very first sight on the very first day of my very first journey(all laugh),broke-up neither wanted to(all laugh),YOU BRAT I’LL KILL YOU UNLESS YOU BRING HER HERE IMMEDIATELY(all laugh) and then managed to calm him down cause none other than Noivern was around outside and then you know my age(all burst into laughter) so I had to oblidge anyway then the longing is so much that even tells me Gengars help everybody but my human plane need is just she ARE YOU ATTENTIVE(all laugh) and this all I had to tell while letting him recreate the same situation with the picture which he had seen first time now even in front of me without any reservations at all(all laugh) so I realized why Gengars indeed have only one partner for life but still creates a mayhem if hindered during seasons(all laugh) thus I insinuated that she has become mentally unstable(all laugh) almost killed me off(all laugh) saying no long collaboration of 16 years of that type so a bit of emotion of such type too(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) so you see this much yearning may be is why the engagement broke off for some reason most possibly Tyranitar knows best(all laugh) and thus stemming from too much bonhomie(all laugh) and both probably are too hurt since and the ego and this level of longing still won’t allow them unless luck or afterlife luckily for all of us it has been the former(all laugh) and yeah in the meantime I once said yeah I know her,saw her with you when you two were 21 at Johto knew you two were in that type of relationship already for 5 years cause of certain movements,words,sentiments and actions(all laugh) and yeah I understand your emotions for her was your longtime girlfriend after all,YOU BRAT DON’T DARE TO ASSOCIETE PAST TENSE WITH HER(all laugh) so I realized I must comply cause his baby brat stared with a mad Rybostorus who is now actually a too much jovially insane Lightenthunstorm(all laugh) who was on his shoulders and was keenly observing me while sparking(all laugh) so I understood what happens if you make Gengars serious(all laugh) so much that my own Gengar appeared in my head and said you brat what are you waiting for huh immediately leave Kanto(all laugh) sadly I had to manage cause I haven’t been able to become as I haven’t in-his-words used all possible illegal things that only Team Rocket boss knows to keep the nerves sane(all laugh) and I know he is doing so since like 16/17(all laugh) Sabrina ever said no Haunter can directly do full subtle body transplantation unless the concerned brat is by every own rights a totally mad Haunter as well(all laugh) so anyway somehow I manage to evade the Lightenthunstorm and Gengar by agreeing to help them to help myself(all laugh) and yeah during the match did use his Gengar and I then itself realized that sort of a brat if has exact another exact same sort of brat named Sableye(all laugh) then life truly becomes a pursuit of that maddening tickling(all burst into laughter) thankfully the real Gengleye were ferried off before so didn’t induct me in hall of that types of famed tickling(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs)..anyway,then the budding disciple Gengar came out as lunatic as his Tyranitar only could imagine(all laugh) and erupted on juniors at 23:30(all laugh) whole world was called in their sleep or lunch and mouthed them off with that language as we know till 2:30 am(all laugh) 3 full hours of nonstop chiding met many Choiced ones in info books now desperate to meet them in person(all laugh) and thus made my job too easy now atleast at some levels(all laugh) and Percy’s too even more(all laugh) so we better comply after his bunch complied with us for 7 years not making everyone go mad excluding McShin cause he faced him again as I compelled him to(all laugh) McShin brought that up in courts as you know and bro was so sorry for that but Lance,Simon and else said it’s no big deal it’s ok but bro directly threatened McShin by saying too much noise is being made do they really want him to break rules and get legends(all laugh) McShin tried to scoff at him saying you’re getting out of hand(all laugh) said,I see out of hand,sweet sweet Stu(all laugh) then I should surrender to the Interregional court at Hagelassberg,Hoenn shouldn’t I(all laugh) McShin immediately said fine this this time I’m at office call me before coming here I’ll sweep the floors of my cabin myself and take orders to serve the food as you date your wife there all you wish(all laugh) even Kanto government of all places has agreed first time along with Kalos that is(all laugh) who again followed suit being first time with Unova that is of all places(all laugh) that terminating this bunch will end the whole pokemon profession itself cause 75% will REVOLT(all laugh) that too being taught by the greatest revolutionary of the most sinister type(all laugh) and then at his deathbed to add to(all laugh) thus all other pokemons will follow suit and all these are only letting the bottom line move up to their throats hence McShin should be kept at ground(all laugh)..then anyway first meeting was there 7 people were there me and Japp of course(all laugh) who is a mole against Jasu(all laugh) well Japp actually told me why so and so Ketchum cause I’m already secured with 5 titles too and he’s from the very clan himself(all laugh) I said well his Crawdauntogator sure is(all laugh) Japp went in vacation during the Unovan fiasco and complained to the court everyday about paychecks to his bunch’s energy drinks(all laugh) and we had another two extract-the-minerals lackies from our farm base(all laugh) who can extract their own infos again(all laugh) and Simon with his three officials were set upon the whole world(all laugh) now I will ever remember the team setup(all laugh), ‘yeah,gentlemen and ladies(all laugh) and respected Mr Simon Gower,I’m sorry to get you involved in my personal business but really I want to be legal(all laugh) the thing is that the Cerulean city gym is very interesting to me(all laugh) and my 2nd badge there but just leave it I want Mehu(all laugh) um..sorry just emotions(all laugh) by then we all were silently laughing(all laugh) cause I knew what Lance couldn’t tell much to Lubos that Mehadi’s state then was what forced bro to realize how much plight my sis was in who isn’t ever Mehadi hence this wordpaly I was compelled to learn first thing(all laugh) cause as you know Mehadi was the culprit who cause my sis so much distress(all laugh) Zara still says why doesn’t bro allow sis to change the name(all laugh) I said no then the further nickname isn’t possible so you know same situation(all laugh) anyway so just after listening to her plight forced Lance to show her picture then the realizations and all then bro told Lance except for my sis he never has any need or want here in personal life and all but Lance said only the words were pungent and too emotional but the disposition I realized first hand why Unovan gyms were so scared to just look at the challenger(all laugh)and the Lightenthunstorm didn’t get these emotions and only seriouness hence I was really counting the years(all laugh)..anyway then bro continues the meeting..so I first want to know about the current marital status of Mehadi Waterflower the youngest waterflower sisters there all I know about 6-8 months ago she wasn’t married and main gym leader now and the marital status means since this date each month after she was nominated in the selected CLASS(all burst into laughter) how many Choiced ones tried to look at my sweet flower and especially who are their chosen secretaries(all laugh)..um..sorry(all laugh)...and we realized that unless we help him all the 84 psychic and ghost bunch too happily will(all laugh) despite him(all laugh) and the trouble is non psychic 46 is as much dangerous as psychic and most horribly with the added note that if not more(all laugh) then says first marital status then each gym brat in hall of fame in the age range(all laugh) must be grilled and unless they budge I’ll visit them gladly for collections 1378th and so on IN HALLUCINATIONS(all laugh) and if you need support I know a few Mimikyu who were registered members of turn the college in haunted house by insinuating certain notes in thrown papers hallucinations(all burst into laughter),anyway(all
laugh),the staffs inside must be threatened with penalties heaviest and give us infos without the whole world’s knowledge and all sorts of informations I want on 5 years which brats dared to go near..WHO ARE THE Choiced BRATS THAT WERE PESTERING HER EVEN WAY BACK IN Pasio TO START WITH(all laugh),anyway(all laugh),sorry I’m just emotional(all laugh) the thing is I heard a certain gym from a city near Cerulean City whose badge I have as Frontier symbol but that was from another leader hall of fame he was no more here now but then was grass gym hall of fame and the next leader cearted some fiasco there in Cerulean Mr Gower where is he now(all laugh) Simon gave the whereabouts then the incidents and we could see the anger(all laugh) said I see the screams are near-far-middle-far while angels and fairys roam around the picture of happy date series ending in eventual dumping,AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all burst into laughter,.) the anticipation of the DARK MOMENT despite LIGHTER FUN(all laugh) a Xormnuh for a day/if another is added with him where’s the way out of bay(all laugh,.)..that was the Team Rocket song with Mexutu and Ulisasus in their heydays(all laugh) and bro has gone to Xormnuh and then literally later(all laugh)..we realized immediately ambulence might be needed(all laugh).. and then says fine then finally as we know the names of possible targets(all laugh) and I know 4 of them who woke up at the very dawn(all laugh) those targets must spit out everything they knew in their previous lives as well(all laugh) else reminiscensing halluciantions deeds that are now erased but if poked are made to get them DARK(all laugh) so search of light themselves will spit out(all laugh and .) have they ever seen a professor of philosophy barracking outside payment office instigating groups of Groudon(all brust into laughter)..I knew what his Groudon can do so knew may turn up inside the room as well as you know anyone can(all laugh)..then he says,basically look I want Mehu RIGHT NOW(all laugh) and can’t legally without knowing these informations cause I don’t want to hinder anyone that dares anyway(all laugh)..’ then tells only me that,’yeah finally the economy class of junior hall of fame(all laugh) Dave both you and me are new imports here(all laugh) I heard that my sweet flower..um..my flower..um..just beat it she’s my eternal wife(all laugh) so I heard that Mehadi isn’t alright and her behaviours has discomforted even Lance so if a brat broke-up then that chosen beau isn’t getting him for sure(all laugh) grill junior artists’ each unmarried or dumped brat(all laugh) we can easily playing sentimental cards get mingled(all laugh) and rest you know(all laugh) and yeah appoint Joel,Ritch and Paul just as would any Throh(all burst into laughter)’..so they had to be to save themselves from getting to become a literal Throh(all laugh) there was very few number of such unmarried brats that were men unfortunately(all laugh) they were told you see Mr Seth Ketchum wants to marry Ms Mehadi Waterflower from Cerulean City gym who is in gym leader’s hall of fame at water gyms in Kanto and was his first travel companion across his first 3 regions so shouldn’t we celebrate such an occasion knowing both the names(all laugh)’ I was told to see the expressions(all laugh) yeah these targets were chosen by him that means each(all laugh) then I filter then if I feel so I will send them to the anatomy master(all laugh)..each flew off to hell as soon as bro’s name is uttered(all laugh) and bro is dreaded even outside profession for that incredible press to differentiate between brother and beau(all laugh)..yeah throughout I had his Chu(all laugh)..and both his and mine were on my two shoulders so enough(all laugh)..so like this it went on and we started to hunt a few people down poor Sarah and family was threatened to death(all laugh) and all just his name and antics were enough if two Elite4s and the implication of Kalos with their money wasn’t enough(all laugh) and then in the mean time Riuminas are beaued(all laugh) then he returns goes to the few chosen ones(all laugh) and that Frucifern head head Mr Cyprus Andrum(all laugh) first Giratina and Ultranercozma was set upon him to show the movie- Karapaskar Wetlands:a day in the life of a college suspended Giratina(all burst into laughter) and how Ultranercozma reviews the college courses to get them changed to serve the bigger talent pool(all burst into laughter) then next hour Gengleye was set upon him who compelled him to tickle them for a full hour as he was taken to dark-fairy mix privacy(all laugh) yeah exact legendary level fairy type hallucinations by a poison-ghost and a dark-ghost(all laugh)?


cause fairy,(dark,ghost,poison,psychic,Sableye nature full awaken how,Gengar nature full awaken how)* life is..


and this was called Dark Night:Bondage and Freedom:the topsy-turvy life of tickling(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..


man what those two pests want to say and what medium they use to express that(all laugh) Gengleye has as you know with Crawdauntogator and many more has entered in textbooks now(all laugh) yeah Guzzlord and Garchomp both have(all laugh) reflections of morality in Ethical honesty in reflections(all burst into laughter) that Zara said is unmatched in the courts(all laugh) and yeah Hoopa too(all laugh) the meaning of this is to mean that it never meant the meaning that you are trying to mean by the meaning(all laugh) then many more as well alone is a+lone hence never alone(all laugh) so yeah almost all brats have entered the books except Heracross(all laugh) man if someone asks in school what is beau counting(all laugh) man that phrase is something indeed cause I still remember first day came here managing to withstand the glares of my sisters here(all laugh) get in there first comes Heracross who didn’t know me says you’re a not not male(all laugh)?


tickle mastery is something indeed(all laugh),anyway,then Frucifern was warned by means of anatomy to behave(all laugh) while he was migrating from one hallucination to other(all laugh) he said later well I was wrong and all ok but why did you suspend me that ghostly tickling hour succeeding the previous hour of suspense comedy movies(all laugh) were more than death in next life too(all laugh) and was in that level of hallucination for 2 hours with
commentaries(all laugh) currently out as you know(all laugh) had to be cause said never saw suspence comedy(all laugh) then other men were there who were threatened and all which bro will himself say(all laugh) then while we do our thing bro went to Venturiastrog then of course Riuminas came by to get Muked(all laugh) told me I said why didn’t you grab that namecall legend(all laugh) said no just that fear of difference between the process and the procedure exists what you think and you’re made to think the difference that is(all burst into laughter) I said well means Riuminas are afraid to get insane then(all laugh) said yeah pretty much just so nice(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)and then I was taken as a sidekick to pick up your death glares(all laugh) then later the fondling(all laugh) and then I was told about your life in full details only afterwards before that Team Rocket Actual(all laugh),by the way as usual Bulbasaur confirmed that I’m his bro later when he said Mr Nofcun doesn’t understand the difference between hence and thus(all burst into laughter) so he’s your bro which means hence is the reasoning chain and thus is the way to prove the siblinglinghood so I don’t understand that hence the relation is natural thus I’m his bro(all laugh) and yeah,I know the Marshadow,Pangoro and Sableye dictum with Sceptilic,Crawdaunted and Glalic confirmations that Drew was shoved down with to his utmost disdain(all laugh) and Trace humanly observed out(all laugh)...but to be honest Gary and all of you were so happy to have me and made me your own in no time but this still excludes the in bro’s words wax-Onix(all laugh) I later infact asked Mrs Slate of this simplicity(all laugh) said you see boy,it’s just that the type differences if you handle for too long becomes own(all laugh) and I realized just so nice(all laugh) and Zara was confirmed by Bronzong actually(all burst into laughter) Bronzong by the end was jovial as well not at this level who yesterday told me this faculty of thought is why you battle(all burst into laughter) cause you want to think about yourself but why(all burst into laughter) see Mr Nofcun,this idea that you can think is why since the beginning till very now you’ve never been able to get over the duality of choise(all laugh) thus you’re still as much unhappy as when you were just born aren’t you(all burst into laughter) I fled the scene as soon as I could cause after this asked do you know how a baby Bronzong similar to you is asked why he thinks to be thoughtful(all burst into laughter) Bronzong was given to her as protection in ending days and his report was Zara was so happy to hear his words that didn’t stop laughing but didn’t try to think furthur hence(all laugh) this he told me before my marriage and I then said man first how can you depend so much on translators(all laugh) said well if not them then not me either(all laugh) so I realized once more why team rocket in 2322 years has no chance and then too cause it’s ever a draw(all laugh) and then I asked but you know this idea of yours to test the gender WIDE issues of foisting yourself in the line of that type(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) this can be dangerous given your own complete package of being Mr Ketchum(all laugh),of course it could(all laugh) that’s the whole point ain't it why bother about the other if it is for something that is not about me but the other as in a person the soul is never the other thus the words becomes another which if is focused on how can you be your’s and never the other(all laugh) so I then itself realized that he was like my cousin and I realized a great cousin indeed(all laugh) cause Squirtle surely wasn’t(all laugh),but also later realized the translator means this whole lab and everyone associeted that are human(all laugh)..anyway then he creats that circus in Cerulean(all laugh) and gets to sis and does what he does to tell the whole world that the water empress was married for 22 years but the emperor was busy in last 4 perfecting the gift of hallucination lectures(all laugh) then later told me of the break-in(all laugh) saying Mehu just needs a date to herself propose me(all laugh) then finally the day before called Zara to know her ring model(all burst into laughter) she could barely stay alive(all laugh) then she gave the phone to me and I said just the one with Gyarados marked on the stone(all laugh) yeah,yeah,Gyarados(all laugh),why is it that Mehadi is so much sought after name yeah,Gyarados(all laugh) why is it that she is a great gym leader yeah,Gyarados(all laugh) don’t mingle untamed pokemons here(all burst into laughter) hence she is now tamed to the utmost misfortune of the challengers(all laugh),then both me and Zara clapped saying finally the Gengar has become Seth Ketchum again to get a specific type of flower(all laugh) yeah,yeah,Waterflower(all laugh) suits the gym type so aptly and that damn show WHICH ONLY I WILL SEE NOW IN FULL PRIVACY(all laugh) then we realized better to not delay cause hospitals may have to be informed otherwise(all laugh) but later we came to know untamed pokemons not involved means they won’t question him dring the date that’s all cause then they are sis to him(all laugh),hence they will provide the reports and 132 of them plus the 3 doctors with zapping dragon specialists will observe over the process(all laugh)..I later asked bro we only saw may be 1.5 hours atmost with a few then they did full lie detection and curing people with Ulisasus and Mexutu combined for 1.5 hours but the person didn’t stay sane after the treatment(all laugh) and here these pests are way way higher than anything and then they were 132 of so many types then so many hourself that level of human emotion plus sis wasn’t alright by any means at all to even begin with,how did they manage and to be honest how was my sis managed(all laugh),yeah just told them when you can’t get us both or either just try to foist your own ideas of us on us with varying force to save yourselves as much so that you are trying to save me but can only do so if I’m alive at physical body still along with you,and this teaching took 14 days continuous subtle body at farm and before that Cerulean hotels as you saw most delicate states I was at never slept then that was done later at home dozing mom off for 2.5 hours and hallucinating brats away from my den(all laugh) and all of these were done to get brats most jovial cause they work against my wishes most times as you know(all laugh) which is why both me and your sis along with them are still alive actually as I told you on the night itself after marrige to prove my claim(all burst into laughter) I said yeah,hence human doctors weren’t preffered in your case(all laugh) said no the gross knowledge is indispensible had innumerable salt mixtures energy drinks water bottles foods for a long meal and a few short ones dresses all other facilities washroom etc her doses,few basic medicines and she was all the way and all around helped by Pelipper,Dragonite,Floatzel and Typhlosion if needed privacy of any kind you know(all laugh) Dragu carried her in his mouth and Floatie and Typhy were in his hands and Pilipper in his tails(all laugh) the fastest and most efficient(all laugh) and yeah Emboar and Golisopod was around the bench where she had to lie down too emotional your sis(all laugh),I said yeah exactly why still you thought a normal date at the lab itself wasn’t the right choise(all laugh) was irritated(all laugh) you know Dave why Japp is more intelligent than you is exactly this SHE WAS A WOMAN(all brust into laughter) I said yeah indeed Japp is lucky not to hear these directly(all laugh) and you know why none other than Neil could’ve saved bro he said never saw anyone letting his brats go to this level no wonder he greeted me saying blood and sweat(all laugh) nerves were as good as anything but they were almost totally disconnected from physical planes(all laugh) and as bro ever says had it been Gengleye that day with him would’ve been very hard indeed exactly why we won’t like them still(all laugh) and actually Neil could pass through all due to Cilan only who alone in Unova and most certainly I guess Kalos too could’ve kept pace with Tyranitar(all laugh) but not Pasio now as we are afraid that may be the offices will itself have Palkias now as teachers(all laugh),Ritch told me last time told him,you see Mr Huminas when I call you by your name you respond but actually I’m doing so to get a few jobs done hence you’re called thus actually when you’re called not you but your ability to do a work is being summoned how cruel this lie calling by name to veil the labour isn’t it(all brust into laughter,Seth cheers for PALKIAN LIFE THROUGH GENGARIAN STRUCTURES leading to the Salamencian mind,all laugh even more)..then both me and Ritchie agreed that at each office one must have termination systems installed the first thing(all laugh)..mental that is(all laugh a lot)..yeah they know the whole saga now like Senor(all laugh shaking their heads)..and the reactions have been like Penny exactly cause they are in his daily customer list as well(all laugh shaking their heads)..but at Unova Cilan ever said man only I konw how I stayed alive cause in the last months after getting Garchomp your bro did like 18 gyms a month for 3 months(all laugh) and the two extra before final was February so 2 days less and then March and within those months were Huntelion and Ulstock again so was 16 and 17 respectively(all laugh) and still on final month did two gyms 2nd and 3rd went to HQ on 3rd itself at night faced me on 7th(all laugh) and I ever recall that final championship at Unova it was madness(all laugh) he entered whole world were expecting him and all and I went there same day before and was curious so go to the place all ask him,20 vs 20..um..(all laugh) says,yeah can you survive without air(all burst into laughter)..then the break days were with his bunch like Madgaleo(all laugh) and Reshiram,Garchomp,Zekrom,Giratina,Guzzlord,Latios,Kyurem and a few more were totally battle starved lunatics so go them out and asked them questions but only at night cause the mornings were in gyms(all laugh) thankfully my match was on a Saturday so was vacation(all laugh) whole world flocked to him still gave me personal time saying he is special(all laugh) and thus one I still recall on 8th the day after my match next day this was to Latios,why bother mate if you can do all but the other(all laugh) this I ofcourse now know is the great Squirtle philosophy(all laugh) hence it made Latios even more lunatic(all laugh),anyway,then after his marriage on that midnight(all laugh) bro told me,Dave Chansbert tried to abudct my flower since last 6 months or so,got abjectly psyched out(all laugh),I was very worried hearing that name having been in relation to sis for that long now after evening so said man why didn’t you keep sis at Henry Care that namecall is extremely dubious,’only cause the patinets wanted her to be she knows it Dave as do my brats more than her(all laugh)..they’ve just surpassed all 132 treated your sis as I went to abjectly humiliate her character and everything in the end my soul you sis came out thanks to these Choiced brats Dave after the end they scoffed at me saying this is your aptitude in continued fractional derivable tickling(all brust into laughter) and you claim to have passed the first paper of the course optimization techniques of deriving reflective happiness in monotonously iterable tickling paper named semi rigorous tickling honestly not ethically- this we get for our hard work behind you,miserable fool(all brust into laughter and cheers for Choiced BRATS,all laugh even more)..indeed Dave they did tickle to counter else you know all would’ve been history(all laugh),so I said yeah comparing to the most notorious philospohy 5+152 now surely Chansbert seems so innocently sweetie now having never had to appear for such papers(all laugh) then bro actually just before taking sis to Marengo told me about Chansbert so we tracked her down tried to flee but we had a primontion since day one so we anyway trapped her there at Flexdijon..but that long for sis I was worried so then still asked it’s a micale that sis survived this long despite her and I understand how much she cherish you exactly from this fact but how exactly did those sinister brats achieve it like it’s not q/a is it(all laugh),unless you define it at present then change it without asking it but you yourself cause a question bears an answer only cause you want it to be so hence the next moment your thoughts want to change exactly why this q/a comes so handy ain’t it Mr Nofcun would say my Dillie(all burst into laughter),I said yeah I understood why Chansbert abjectly humiliated her name trying to fondle your nerves and the brats Dillie included(all laugh) who kept saying whose whose beau cause wasn’t stable if so none including me would’ve survived(all laugh) then said but bro still like if sis was emotional and broke down and was trying to find an answer like that or too dejected cause of your words and so on(all laugh) then how the hell did that utmost lunatic brat Dialga manage it to make a q/a then at the end say what does these all mean to you mentally that is(all laugh),well Dave dilly was at second or third layer can’t recall I only knew the first layer ask Quizzy for the whole process he was the reviewer(all laugh)..I understood how thus the process was so aptly executed cause the elusive dragon was never to be materialized phychophysically(all laugh) then bro says,anyway this is from first layer she said I tried to forget you couldn’t no matter what I did when my Sableye straightaway said cause you didn’t tickle did you(all brust into laughter,CHEERS FOR TICKLE MASTERY,all laugh even more) then she ofcourse didn’t get his charges as I already banned all translators from the lab that day all were at my home under the tuteledge of Liskie the most heartening(all laugh) Dr Skechit was threatened as usual like he has been for 22 years now via Marshadow(all laugh) and Banette(all laugh) so she didn’t get these then she understood I was only suffering at Unova as I didn’t get my wife in abstraction that I will drag her to now again exactly why she couldn’t be fondled much despite 6 months at Chansbert(all laugh)..I WILL DO WHATEVER I WANT WITH MY FLOWER(all laugh)..anyway just the emotions(all laugh)..so anyway then she wanted to reconcile I thus increased my torture cause I didn’t want that as the word is implausible in abstraction(all laugh) as said my Bayleaf then and there when she said that she wants me so madly,just ask her are you hungry so badly(all burst into laughter)..hence I logically namecalled her wasn’t it logical for me to do Dave wasn’t it(all brust into laughter),I said just don’t let that brat anywhere near the farm(all laugh) then bro says,well at a time she said I’ll die if you now reject me,instantly Cherruvuemin said one of her types she means becomes fulfilled thus changes hence(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter),so I told her you can die out psychophysically only(all laugh),she didn’t get the hallucination so was crying too much hence had to tender her much when suddenly Rotom said this change of forms momentary keeps your wheeling in rotary thus you call it sanity ain’t it master brat a bound out of which lies assurity(all brust into laughter),then she had to go to washroom and there was a real mess I cleared it up with the help of Floatie who didn’t want to help cause to her this cleaning happens when you suffer for sanity cause it anyway gets dissipated biochemically the naturality(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter),so I said yeah as if you’ve had a hubby to care for(all laugh),she said it was outragious for we or your brats master brat to have one cause it’s only your idea against so many that you vie for(all burst into laughter)


so then finally once just before she said that she has been under Chansbert’s grasp she almost literally lost it so I was a bit worried as have I gone too much exactly when Marshadow said kid you call yourself our sweeper and this is your aptitude in predicting the propotionate variation of sustainable gaze vs amount of wink in cognition vs perception(all burst into laughter) so Magie said and you think you can know why legs and hands are each other especially when you try to know both become ideas hence the difference perishes yet at use they relishes as Spiritomb just said,who said this new import has just been too deceptive for us to gauge hence we at the last psychic charge asked her who dies you or that fear of your urge(all brust into laughter) hence Confra said thus now showing her contemplative lives of Yamasks who becomes orphan and neglected how they die only to themselves lie against just this fact that ah this idea of being not here only contrasts the urge or fear that if we want this we may not get it cause nothing to us is dear thus seeing it again from a different heaven that it’s just a point of view that change as the illusion barge(all brust into laughter)..I said you brats what if she dies,Hoopa instantly replied,you mean no more cries(all brust into laughter),don’t try to be a fool she may or may not given which idea of herself she decide to rule as after each charge we are saying cut this off unless you’re just a damn tool(all brust into laughter),I said man you were half a step away from death literal,didn’t agree Heatran bro surely you know who is that pokemon(all burst into laughter),I said yeah one of the most merciless brats that lives right at the bed of a volcano despite being steel hence(all laugh),exactly why their life is harder isn’t it bro our comes from a family who are social workers demanding the rights of a practical beau(all brust into laughter)..so I said yeah I understand what utmost brats somehow managed to not kill their master and his wife who was already in so much mental pain(all laugh),exactly Dave once your sis said just smile once more to me I’ll die after that anyway I insinuated on smile and linked it with the shut door and she almost lost it you know,I was really concerned so said man bro how did the brats get her out of that(all laugh),well Bulby sleep powdered her this time may be by himself I didn’t know where I was hence was saved(all brust into laughter) I only just hugged your sis madly and asked Whimsi is she alive,Hoopa replied you mean will she survive(all brust into laughter) Banette added correct yourself compeer he’s asking you to present the past not future(all brust into laughter),I see he means is sanity a vector(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter),Dusky and Gothi jointly said while he’s forgetting if one was alive and now no more according to the temporal scale the absolute isn’t found as the existence is extracted already in abstraction out of time to be an understanding of present state hence history is created just to support your illusion at present so according to time atleast thus none can be alive due to their instant death or the viseversa due to the same isn’t it look-only-at rhyming with Discuss-Gap(all unocntrollbaly laugh,tears,Stash and Seth cheer for Choiced BRATS,all laugh even more)..man Choiced for sure(all laugh) then bro said at this,then Greninja said their reaction at your reply to her according to Kalos is only called duality of reciprocation when you reciprocate to something already knowing what you are saying makes it a statement ain’t it(all brust into laughter),Gengy explained that exactly why it tickles both whose own ideas of tickling presents themselves as reactions to the same at the instigation of this particluar tickling as opposing each other hence the tickling deepens but becomes dual hence both get detached from universal tickling(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,cheers for TICKLE MASTERY,all laugh even more) yeah mastery for sure(all laugh) now Darkrie adds infact their thirst for the same gets them in trouble when in-bwteen their search they have to fix a point undefined between perfection and imperfection to separate the two else can’t cogitate progress such pitiful creatures(all burst into laughter) now Whimsi finally said well as she didn’t understand the flux of her moods is the only thing that’s making her to guess you in different moods and yet trying to concur everything to get a hint of your true expression without understanding it will only be her accumulation not yours cause you are only a tool to her to understand her own misery of deluding herself as the flux itself thus told Bulby to doze her off so that she gets detached from you a relief isn’t it look-only-at exactly like your idea of plurality yet singular specifiability of the idea of hat(all burst into laughter) I said you brat what have you prescribed your compeers to show,I only thought she was lukewarm to the admission that she’s not what you are telling her to be cause any half intelligent newbron Cottonee understands that when you contradict someone you only want them to admit it not to react to it cause it means you’re fighting with your own ideas of not the other’s existence that only simulates your illusion doesn’t it look-only-at(all burst into laughter),then Malamar said hence showing her Malamar fights and how one beau kills his opponent and wins his target while the dead body decomposes(all burst into laughter) then I just asked them how is she going to return now(all laugh),you mean if her current sanity will again endow(all brust into laughter),


Malmie said well any half witted newly exsistent brat understands that when you die you’re relived cause the previous doesn’t disturb you anymore as you become free to choose new associetion exactly why you die isn’t it master brat hence whose happier the dead or the living or just you having been in-betwwen the two thus unrecognizable from any(all brust into laughter) then Quizzy added exactly why she will ask herself what is life won’t it compeers how can you stay dead when you know you were alive too(all brust into laughter) hence by this she must understand that an ideal dragon is free from existence cause he doesn’t try to be to see how to be me(all brust into laughter) I told Bulby I’ll forsake each of you if she dies,Baylie retorted we were told only to quench her hunger for conviction exactly what we’re doing that she is not she thus how can she ever claim herself to be me(all brust into laughter) finally Bulby said you see lad your penetrative power is on all time low now atleast when you met this brat first time you were still happy rather than now thus how has she come into any use of yours the futility of your attempt at being you while seeing you(all brust into laughter) Confra added and then to review you by being your own beau hence master brat we ever asked in the beginning for whom so much your thirst that who master brat who exactly was your beau(all brust into laughter and cheers for whose whose BEAU,all laugh even more)..yeah chosen beaus by all means(all laugh) anyway then bro said I remembered that my first layer shouldn’t have had Bannie and Magie(all laugh) so I asked Quizzy why are these two Choiced brats here(all laugh) Guzzy replied(all laugh) cause there’s no other layers now(all brust into laughter) when she came here she was honest when she tried to resist you was serious but was moral(all laugh) but now that she is only sumbmerging more and more into sorrow cause she’s morally honest still but not ethical in her vigil(all burst into laughter) you see master brat you can become honest and moral but never ethical yourself for that you have to observe yourself thus realize none are important cause all are interlinked to your ideas only which itself is illusive cause of your detachment yet thirst only(all laugh) but she refuses temporally to recognize that she is free eternally thus she is will be happier if we discourage her more hence only I spoke to my compeers who agreed to me that the first layer should itself have enough power to dictate her pace away from you cause that’s whatyou want isn’t it hence making her more sad cause the morality dictates she will be she if only free and honesty says that is from her idea of thee but Ethics dictates these two are only issues to be never alone in what you call as me else that you’ve itself set you free isn’t it(all burst into laughter) so Nivy now said this is only the age of a particular thought which comes around too many times thus ages but while it will die of that itself you say I’ve become caged cause I can’t separate between the actual idea and to me what is paged(all brust into laughter) I asked him why are you involved you weren’t supposed to be(all laugh) Duye replied we thought she is getting more and more conscious of her makeup of determination hence her trouble is increasing ain’t it look-only-at(all brust into laughter) when you try to look good you first define your own look to be incomplete hence how can you ever not admit your poor state temporally(all brust into laughter)


and Jelty said hence you want freedom from sanity had you two had that would’ve continued to be at different states thus you’re disconnected if connection was a trouble why bother to begin the process afterall(all brust into laughter)


so anyway after this your sis woke up then she wasn’t ok so I took her in my cabin and she needed to go to washroom and so on was in a terrible mess then realized I was tendering her a lot but I had to hallucinate that cause Palki kept telling me don’t try to know her needs unless you know she doesn’t need them at all(all brust into laughter) so I just kept up the healing process,it was hard to fit Bayleaf in the room so she said get Plumie in I said she’s poison type it’s no good(all laugh),Plumie was zapped in by Quizzy saying foolish kid who decides the pace of the conference the rapturous or the tranquail(all brust into laughter),Plumie said the difference between the poison that Gengy represents to me is that he goes to the self tickling by means of abstracting the aggregate ticklings whereas I go there by summing them up hence he has to first understand the meaning of each fraction of tickling whereas I only try to maximize that isn’t it Gengy(all brust into laughter),yeah innumerable ways to get become the tickling self master brat make no mistake the difference is so only cause the ticklings appear differently but you the perceiver remain the same who actually tickles you hence only you perceive don’t you how can you know tickling unless you’ve already defined it as it tickled(all brust into laughter) oh yeah Dave then Plumie got in and tickled me(all laugh),I said yeah cause they have mastered the art of reactive tickling(all laugh),then bro says indeed hence only your sis could get out of the trap afterall Sablie summed it up all a matter of choosing from a menu card the best tickling never conclusive ever reflective hence exclusive thus different to each other despite the urge being same,tickling of subjective premordial agitation,creatures(all brust into laughter) which means afterall both your sis and me were only trying to find miximized tickling isn’t it so Dave(all laugh),I said just make sure sis gets 1000% treatment cause she has become a shuttle cock between the pad and Chansbert(all laugh) the later of which God forbid hasn’t done much to her cause the former doesn’t know the meaning of stopping at all and at worst refuses to do so most vehemently(all laugh)**


well Dave as your sis got the fact that I was tendering her a lot said why are you doing these if I’m just a random sample to you,I said cause I don’t want to be the cause of your death so she said you will be then will follow me cause you’ve nothing to do here then understood that I want pure abstraction thus almost got out of that I saw her smile and joy in her face Dave I knew I have my wife back again when Regigigus said is realization of joy a counter or an attack with respect to itself(all burst into laughter),so I sighed at that moment sternly told them don’t provide me with lines(all laugh),Shedie said thus her joy grows only due to lack of reaction from you or the viseversa hence it’s not independent of you so why are we here(all brust into laughter)..**


,so I told her once you die you won’t know if my perspectives changed on singularity or not cause the discernment hasn’t ended alluding to the fact that she is only an abstraction never has been out of that thus she could become reproducible(all laugh) so she just I’ve seen her over the years Dave and today itself so many moods never saw her get as if hit by a truck like that just brusted into tears and was sleep powdered so after that I myself was reduced to tears almost cause what I did to her and was doing wasn’t entirely with my own will you know the brats were told by Daunty to distribute until I don’t give up redistributing(all laugh a lot) so at this I was thinking enough now no more when Jelli said this knowledge of the other is ever disheartening isn’t it look-only-at when Magie added as no matter good or bad you ever think why are you not me(all brust into laughter,Seth cheers for A GENGARIAN perspective of SMOOTH LIFE,all laugh even more)..yeah indeed smooth(all laugh),so bro says,I just sighed and said get prepared to the final conference if she dies today I won’t live here one minute more neither will your master brat cause of me infact will go before anyone as the vultures will(all laugh shaking their heads,Seth and . a lot),Tombie said whom are you afraid of then(all brust into laughter),so I just shook my head and proceeded to take her ring size(all laugh) while asked Hoopie how can you know she won’t die,Ninjie replied according to Kalos you die only if you can no more answer the question what is life without the thought of death(all brust into laughter),Yvely said hence we’re asking her that and her signals suggests she is still happy or sad hence still understands the termination points how can you be happy if you know you’re so only cause you’re so cause you’re less not so(all brust into laughter),I said yeah I’ve got both you and that brat Solgy but what is the main culprit doing the main brat due to whom I couldn’t marry my dear girlfriend rather turned on her(all laugh),Tyrie said I’m busy don’t disturb me with your ideology of folded unfolding if you think you can get free you must be so at once you can’t stop in the middle or when you’ve reached there exactly as this brat is doing instigated by girlfriend(all brust into laughter),I said who is girlfriend Tyrie,Rotom said correction change the form in a continuum not asking how to terminate the process(all brust into laughter) I said thus elusive ever hence you brats are too happy aren’t you that you don’t have to battle but I show you how about I myself turn on you,correction change the form then you get yourself only cause changing our forms only to yours have you reflected us as an idea of self relective features of denominating abstraction reflected into varieties hence you must cherish all so much shouldn’t you look-only-at in reflection(all brust into laughter)**


,I asked Chomp what’s the need of Zeky in this(all laugh),no she reflects well how to get out of her own self reflection cause she tries to define it as not so in reflections(all brust into laughter)**


,Zeky said unless you cherish all how can you know you can cherish all the abstraction of what is what you’re searching for aren’t you master brat by cherishing all not the idea that sanity never suggests(all brust into laughter)**


then I was taking her ring finger size and was kicking myself that why once more I didn’t have a false ring if by chance Chansbert has done too much to her(all laugh) so I said just tell me what Thundurus knows of marriage(all laugh a lot)**..,the brat said when you know you want to be with a particular is the exact time when you forsake your freedom(all brust into laughter),..**..but the worst part is not this but when you take it away from the other look-only-at then you incur a possible revolution don’t you look-only-at equitably(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter),I said yeah what if I revolt against you(all laugh) suddenly Shitree’s only compeer Infie appeared said look-only-at didn’t I tell you to give up your sanity that you have known her by being unknown to her as me hence only you are going to be even more sad as she tries to tell you I’m only thee(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter),I said why are you here leaving your job of looking after the rest of the gang,well it’s so cause Chu told me to check if the process is getting prolonged enough cause in his personal opinion you’ve never been professionally adept at quick thinking(all brust into laughter),I said unless you leave a mile away within a second I’ll scrap your food for whole day tomorrow(all laugh),Embie said exactly why Infie fighting life with fire has got him into so much sorrow(all brust into laughter),..**


so then I realized that the brats are just getting started(all laugh) so I asked Sablie how long can you continue this,as long as tickling doesn’t become permanent mentally the sensation cause if so you require nothing else don’t you master brat(all brust into laughter)**


so anyway,then again your sis woke up and all but then finally Dave she realized the reality that me and her the same only the appearance of duality to each our our own fondness becoming dual has created each other so she said this but I said knowing it to be so you’ve lied to yourself hence how can I believe you by not hating you the most(all laugh) so she was dozed off again this though I did intentionally cause Kyurem instigated to tell me what’s the point of birth only to understand that it’s duality is ever pungent hence pursue death atleast it’s not revealing itself to you till reached like life(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Seth cheers for THAT FEELING,all laugh even more)**


so then she woke up and then herself said thus you are existing eternally only to totally devastate me like this again and again through eternity and went off again cause she thought thus she won’t have me again so sweet your sis(all brust into laughter) so thus Banette said that’s the trouble with future you want it only to cogitate the past never the present ain’t it look-only-at(all brust into laughter),anyway then after this one Daunty finally tried to get involved saying all till has been combined thus now it’s time to recombine force the brat through each phases now cause having overcome each she herself will redistribute herself in order to get customized for the new states hence she will enjoy the new conference more won’t she look-only-at as would say master brat(all brust into laughter,Seth cheers for COUNTERING,all laugh even more)**..then Stashey scoffed at him saying don’t try to recombine yourself via distributions rather during(all burst into laughter) to this he said exactly why the vultures have been combinatorially methodical hasn’t they master brat rather at any point distributed in insinuating(all burst into laughter),Stashey said just ask her how to know what is leakage unless she knows how to fix it Dilly added emotionally though(all burst into laughter)..**


and each agreed to it(all burst into laughter) hence I asked Ferali of his personal opinion(all brust into laughter) said professionally this brat has ever been able to get serious(all brust into laughter) hence I agree wholeheartedly with my compeers on their plan to turn her against herself now showing how each phases having passed has created hope in her exactly why she can’t reach her destination cause now she has just imagined the path to be of more danger hence the destination gets further in retrospect how can you be happy by being so only cause you’ve become so only thus not not so hence hope is the signal of abject failure aint it Bulby(all brust into laughter),exactly why I asked when my mom asked me Bulby can you hear me I said exactly what do you mean by trying to mean something cause you’ve expected me to reciprocate to you due to your ideas of me already how thus can I add anything to it(all brust into laughter)**


so then I turned to Typhlosion(all brust into laughter) he was in-charge of looking after your sis outside so I asked what’s your assesment of her,when you desire to have something you only have your desire ever never the thing cause without desire it’s of no use isn’t it look-only-at like sanity(all brust into laughter)**


so now I spoke with your sister’s personal attendent in charge Pelipper(all brust into laughter),no in perfection to the perfected dealit’s the very first rule that you can’t expect yourself to be successful cause then in a deal you put your expectaion hence you lose the art of neutrality(all brust into laughter)**


,Flotie was with Pellie added hence Mr Mehadi doesn’t understand the sad self and self in sadness how can you be sad knowing you are sad not sadness is in you how can you be not sad when you know you can become sad despite already having the potential(all brust into laughter)..


so now I asked Typhie’s compeer Embie(all burst into laughter) he noted with great intellect(all laugh) that exactly what we’re trying since day one to tell you all don’t try to fight with fire cause fire itself is the reason for starting the fight the origin of self and being hence the fire the original illusion master brat how can she get what she wants unless she stops fighting then what she wants looses it’s shine to her hence the path is easier ain’t it look-only-at(all burst into laughter)**


,so now I asked Charizard(all brust into laughter) said well Mr Mehadi is playing you look-only-at neither can you fondle her most while she sleeps cause she is making you sad and not sleeping all time showing she is doing so cause she is sad then while waking she refuses to admit your words hence prolonging your urge only you see cunning(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,Seth cheers for THIS DAY A DATE,all laugh even more)..yeah surely that was the culprit himself to had envisaged that date and minutely chalked the approach in full detail of sanity along with Alomomola(all laugh a lot) said may be Dave Momlie said when you know you can realize what is what is the moment you lose your power of analysis don’t you look-only-at(all uncontrollably laugh,..),I said yeah that’s why the brat should’ve been thrown out in the ocean right there(all laugh a lot),so finally I asked Dragu of his observations(all laugh) he said I don’t get this foolishness of particular evolution how can you know I’m not a Pelipper and he the opposite afterall she is foolish to not realize if she admits you she will get it easier with you cause then she can evolve her ideas as you keep pinned down to your current state(all brust into laughter)**


so you know Dave I understood that these brats are now in that section where if I push them more they will literally kill all existing there including themselves cause Baylie said Quizzy doze these two serious brats off and get Mimey,Glalie and Heli in with all else this is the asymptotic conjecture of conscious hunger(all burst into laughter) Stashey added and also symbiosis of factual gender(all uncontrollably laugh,..)..so you know Margin turned Stashey down as he differed wrongly cause afterall it’s Stashey’s twin sis as well(all laugh a lot) so anyway then I just had to desist cause I recalled when he came with me there was a deal that unless for vultures we don’t agree simultaneously ever causally(all laugh a lot) hence only am present here still along with your sis and his twin and his and my elder bro whose wife should’ve disliked this emotion from him but strangely ferment it rather than suffocating(all laugh a lot,Stash,Seth and Gary cheers for MR VACCINE Site,all uncontrollably laugh,..)..man only brats like those two can understand these pests properly(all laugh a lot)..so I after this long horror movie(all laugh) said man seriously just quit this profession you know you have enough money now in gross even(all laugh),then bro said they are not human my dear bro hence only we are just creatures(all laugh),then I asked how’s she,I don’t know cried for 7 hours had not been helped one heart attack definitely if not more(all laugh),would’ve vomitted like 3 times to her 23 Dave a few did have some blood in increasing amount(all laugh) but the number still Dave so sweet your sis just as Mehu rhymes saw(all brust into laughter),I said yeah other people would’ve went there with 7 region strong military unless were univalent(all laugh),may be Dave but she might’ve lost a kg or may be 2 even today itself(all laugh)..yeah needed blood too(all laugh) I don’t recall the amount though was a lots of capsules(all laugh),bro you’re not a doctor(all laugh),no Margin was there(all laugh),I’m unsure of his sanity in cases like this due to his methodology of diffusing confusion(all laugh a lot)’,no he only said evolution is the stasis of funeral of irony/those who attend that thus rightfully revolt against the vegetation of canny(all uncontrollably laugh,..),what did his eternal total reflection say(all burst into laughter,Stash,Seth and Gary cheers for MR MAXIM FIGHT,all uncontrollably laugh,..)..yeah exactly why(all laugh a lot) anyway bro said,Logical Scythe only said(all laugh a lot) no I agree to this process Seth but you know this is only the semaphore for focal organization yet what you actually wanted was the metaphor of parametric decentralization isn’t it(all uncontrollably laugh,..),I said yeah rhyming with Volbeat hence(all laugh a lot),then bro said no Neil and Edu were camouflaged by Gary’s brats whole time exactly why they refused to dance to his rational tunes not emotional ones hence I horribly sweared his future to help relieve him of it as a safety valve professionally(all laugh a lot,Gary shakes his head laughing) and yeah the need of blood or other medicines it was managed the need and amount was measured by Sceptile and Whimsicott(all brust into laughter),that’s a heinous menace devoid of any kind of mental sanity with a forsaken legend in perceptual instability(all laugh a lot),hence only they could help another such logically isn’t it logical Dave isn’t it Dave isn’t it rhyming with Meowstic(all burst into laughter),yeah what did he say(all laugh),he said motion abound is the list/of the menus in your table thus ever small enough fit only the gist(all uncontrollably laugh,..)/hence you only balance between noun and verb/adjective and adverb thus never conserved..countering isn’t it look-only-at isn’t it(all uncontrollably laugh,..) so I said,yeah neither me nor your sis would have supported you at court(all laugh),neither would’ve Zed(all laugh),but not because of the same reason I guess(all laugh),um..no that would’ve meant we wasted one term to finish the story on hand hence unnecessarily prolonged the show for the spectators the emotions(all brust into laughter),yeah only a brat like that could get along with 4 brats like those across planes hence his society surely isn’t it(all laugh),well may be Dave but you know


,then this heat sweated a lot profusely then the foods were barely digested for the whole day and then the blood Dave terrible in washroom many times apart from a bit in the vomits those were horrible I don’t remember the number of times(all laugh),she was close to literal death very very close and nervous breakdown too had or would’ve had convulsions so many times and so on all possible troubles she faced just her longing for me was left not she that’s my Mehadi I told you so many times that it rhymes saw(all brust into laughter),I said yeah thankfully you’re alive too thus(all laugh),no the brats Dave the brats(all laugh),I would’ve followed her instantly if she died with my brats only and we were close but that is to our scale to Quizzy’s we finished it at the position of half passed semi of half most enmeshing that interests a dragon just about(all brust into laughter),so I said yeah dragons for sure 78 in numbers involved countering(all laugh a lot),what does the doctors say the human ones(all laugh a lot),I said she’s my girlfriend for 24 full years had a break up was depressed for almost 5 years itself the whole time then today we went through a whirl really as you can see(all laugh),they said yeah she looks to be far far more than so but you look as if just have come out after sea-saw(all laugh),I wasn’t in a mood to appease them so just hugged your sis and said and will be with myself only(all laugh) so they realized I was devastated intellectually that was only emotional part though I now am realizing cause when Palkia herd first charged at me mid ocean after Stashey and Regus(all laugh a lot) asked them of the referentiality of the idea of damage(all burst into laughter) and I was only with Toxie and Abomie as they are assured of it’s congruence to peripheral sanity thus could circulate them via the self insidiously not invidiously(all burst into laughter)..Toxie was holding me,Abomie kept an eye on the whole place for my safety but someone hosted me..who was it who was it..yeah Claydol(all brust into laughter),why grounds are disadvantage but clay(all brust into laughter),I said yeah clay surely mentally though(all laugh) then how did you make sure that poor Cili and Iris returned safely(all laugh),Xkurki,Coblie and Groudi why the former and the last said I can float in air and zap under the water the middle one said I can swim(all burst into laughter)


that was different though Dave when my Palki was in charge during my time(all laugh) came in said I see trying to know despite not knowing how foolish(all brust into laughter),I asked what do you people do(all laugh),they said we try to not know ourselves what else lad how many days would you keep sitting at the back(all brust into laughter),so that was hard Dave then all of them Chomp you know before that Guzzy,Giti,Zeky for sure(all laugh),and all the rest Dave,that volcano Reshi’s home dined there the food was cold they said frozen lava(all laugh) when Stahey got Resmie(all laugh) had Phampie there infact not alone cause Xernie was there(all brust into laughter) why ground and fairy both are advantages against pure fires aren’t they Dave aren’t they rhying with Mudbray(all brust into laughter),I said yeah first thankfully that abominable menace to intelligence isn’t present in the physical heard(all laugh a lot) and secondly those who were there as you mentioned an utter brat and Xerneas indeed they are advantaged specially against dragons and especially against fire dragons at volcano beds and most especially if the utter brat is a ground type biologically and is a Donphan physically(all laugh),then sent me the two pictures the happiest two just after(all laugh),I said from this itself I can get first how much complete a part of life you are to your wife and second why she is indeed your soulmate but most importantly third is just that how much torture my dear sis has had to endure to show it to her eternal hubby just because that namecall doesn’t know how to date her MANUALLY(all laugh),no Dave I could’ve taken her out for a dinner at any underground cell at Kalos,Unova or Sinnoh you know(all laugh)..she can barely cogitate in a proper manner in my presence ever you know so sweet my flower(all laugh),I said yeah you better go to privacy now enough with Lenny’s antics over 23 damn years release the poor kid man it’s INHUMAN(all laugh),well humanity has only reached the half part Dave my bros are left just the extension of the soul according to Gengar who was there when we had our realizations dear don’t you recall(all laugh),I said yeah Cilan does too(all laugh),indeed Cili has to now build up Spiritomb nests at Unova and Kalos you know one sole region for any soulful brat tickles Dave doesn’t it(all laugh),I said yeah soulful absolutely(all laugh)..just don’t import Kommo-Os at Pasio now(all laugh) and man just get in privacy without the brats you know(all laugh),yeah when we will have our dinner here,at hospital(all laugh),um..yeah the environment here especially being a mental one is rather..most peaceful if not serene(all brust into laughter) and no I myself have Meow and Mushie still but she has someone too with her that is while she is getting checkup(all laugh),can’t you guess Dave(all laugh),Alkie or who(all laugh),Crawdaunt(all brust into laughter),he wasn’t used in the process as you know too fresh and seething hence(all laugh),hence only you two are still here along with the brat himself a distribution he isn’t liking at all I guess exactly why sis is in grave danger still how can you sit so calmly leaving her at the hands of a marked out brat like that(all laugh),non psychophysically yeah(all laugh),and no Alkie said during he process that,momentum is measured by means velocity/velocity is measured by means of ability/ability is measured by means of differentiability/which is measured always by means of probability countering(all uncontrollably laugh,..),I said yeah exactly why these menaces have to be kept under the care of Dr Oak I understand now only(all laugh a lot,cheers for HUSH!PROFESSIONALISM!,Gary shakes his head laughing) then bro said,but they are at a better hight hence their heaven for your sis way vitalizing and hell as much painful for me Dave isn’t it Dave isn’t it(all brust into laughter),I said yeah just wish Daunty doesn’t use his only once combinatorial faculties to demonstrate both ESPECIALLY TO MY DEAR SIS AT THIS CONDITION NOW(all laugh) then we cut off and I told Zara that thank goodness sis is alive you know(all laugh),she knew bro will be severe but was apprehensive I said don’t worry still didn’t have to use Crawdaunt(all laugh) she said thanks for relieving me(all laugh),but is securing her check-up(all laugh),Dave are you sure it won’t go down to the courtrooms still(all laugh a lot),I said yeah I’m sure that it will be non psychophysical there(all laugh),she was present ofcourse on that forsaken day(all laugh) so knew exactly what this particular brat alone is capable of 4 long years later with full Kalos Wisdom(all laugh) and still thankfully we didn’t have to meet the likes of 16 rocks and Zeraora then(all laugh)..man it was strange that Stash only had one rock type no matter which brat epitomized that was(all laugh) but the in Kalos got 16 rocks and what chosen brats those are by all means(all laugh),anyway these all were when bro was in Marengo then later in midnight call said,creatures indded Dave we are as are Ceruleans so tried their hands at mobbing me got abjectly Ketchumed(all laugh) just will give the ring today after explaining my activites to her family and then playing a prank on them cause it’s my family too and these 6 chosen ones are most especial especially among them is a man who..bro please take over(laughs,all laugh)..”
Seth(laugh) : “remains steady even in all sorts of air pockets you know(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing,Seth cheers for OH NOW MY TEDDY OAK!NOW HUSH!NOW PROFESSIONALISM!SO OH MY STEADY OAK!,all uncontrollably laugh,..)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah this little brat has backstabbed us with a naive look(all laugh)..no wonder these imports are exactly like the very brats(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “well I can never forget the first introduction to Trace at the farm ever(all laugh),anyway then back to Cerulean massacre and Oak lab fight(all laugh),so told them that will play a prank on her family and then said prank cause her family is too serious about life now in illusion in these days of responsible married life creatures(all burst into laughter) and this one is most serious in degree cause unlike any other time it has the once ever prized scalp this time by the name of Steady Oak vehemently denying to look sturdy he applied a bit of a soap(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) I just asked what were your protections apart from GitiCozy(all laugh) said no Ninjie showed them a few tricks all appeased after getting confused with 50 on 1 challenge proposal all at a time(all laugh) then just fed them the sentimental card that rather than complaining against me they should let the sisters have their life so all were abjectly tickled(all laugh) I said yeah still far better than getting so literally via UltraCozy(all laugh) but what should the relatives do in such case and what did Mr Oak do he
was most formal(all laugh),well the relatives should’ve been the ones to tell him as Chu said later I told all to prolong the procedure till that idiot himself snaps cause the sample that will be here today(all laugh) was only imported unto us cause I involved both in a mess as I could’ve been with the three brats that intervened my process with master brat I could’ve been with them rather than him you know but he first sight asked me halloww how do you know I really am not expecting a reply but only transmitting mine(all brust into laughter),see other brats that came to me till then tried to understand me the first mistake to the path of doom how can you understand another knowing it’s not you hence ever another the definition and perception(all brust into laughter) thus I didn’t bother about them this brat tried to know himself even more a disgracefull endeavour(all laugh) how can you know yourself unless you know the other as else you become become yourself only never another(all brust into laughter,Seth cheers for NO PROGRESS IF BORN,all laugh even more),yeah indeed so(all laugh),anyway so the brat continued,thus I came unto master brat cause all else seemed to be in a better position to get out of themselves except this idiot(all laugh) hence he needed help but then those 3 hindered us so we fell in a lake then I went in his jacket inside water thinking before dieing I will take him under my tutelage out of compassion(all laugh a lot) then the brat manages to get out of it just as I was about to thunder-chair submerged in a lake(all laugh) I felt levitating so thought must be those 3 that has returned so I laughed at them thinking how foolish wants me but has to get this brat out of death too else can’t get me which they want creatures(all laugh) so went off then woke up in that place that we go to seeing utter fools being treated by only more foolish humans for their injury(all laugh a lot) all of which they perceive themselves yet refuse to admit they are alright cause they think that hinderes them to live how can you live unless you are healthy how can you be so when your body is defined as health already hence you’re only hindering it by tempering it(all brust into laughter,Seth cheers for TAUROS DICTUM OF GROWING UP PSYCHOPHYSICALLY,all laugh even more),yeah had I followed that would’ve been 2 ft tall 2322 kg in weight(all laugh) anyway,then Chu says,anyway then somehow manage to get out of the hands of brats that despite not being us tries to feel our problems(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) so I wake up and went to master brat and saw this new sample(all laugh) was too childish trying to follow master brat hence I realized so delicious the food(all laugh) and master brat seemed to become more foolish while in her presence cause none wants to think then(all laugh) so I understood both are similar samples hence would be great fun which had been the case for so long till she suddenly dissappeared(all laugh) hence as she is returning today mustn’t we prolong the joy compeers a toast don’t allow her in easily before knowing whether to bake or just roast(all laugh)..yeah these words were once more inserted due to fire types by threatening Trace ofcourse(all laugh),anyway so bro said thus you see relatives should behave as Chu was surely she and the rest could’ve approach the situation without their sanity of being(all laugh)**


,I said yeah most engaging but won’t exactly like them no matter the brats(all laugh),exactly what Gary was trying to simulate you know which surprized me cause day one I understood that the question how to be is interrelated to I’m me did he say welcome bro to sanity(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)**


,I said what did he do,no he couldn’t keep to himself when I insinuated about his future infront of his wife(all laugh) I was shocked(all laugh) so I asked what happened,no nothing Gary you know 15 days older to me ever my twin bro didn’t realize it’s about my nephew and my sis-in-law whose my sweet little big sis too(all laugh) and my twin bro not about those namecalls the sanity he was talking about all those years back(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) you know I only said my nephew is shared responsibility without discretely mentioning it cause he is claimed to be a genius in reading between lines failed with words here boastful creatures(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing) and this was possible only cause my sweetest little big sis(all laugh) the 3rd eldest Lillie was a bit frivolous in her early tweenties 20/21 years back nowhere near as much as her hubby brat was cause of being sturdy(all laugh) and when she turned 25 she had totally got rid of that and what did he do in the meantime,entertained a few brats that validated their psychophysical existence as beings(all laugh) and second this process they executed at the cost of her thus deluded her thinking of herself as a woman exactly whom I sweared at and again will EACH TIME(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) why is it Dave that mothers are given 3 year leave,fathers 2(all laugh),I said man just beat it and atleast talk with them NOT ONLY MENTALLY(all laugh),yeah have to Dave have to..she of all sinisters didn’t seem to understand that I was there all time being close to her famillialy in profession not yet relatively as a personal(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) which she may try to tell me as I go to apologize to her by not saying as if your hubby didn’t apply Palkian chain upon you by calling you Lillie never Lil only to stress upon the last part of the name just as the deal cause you seemed to him as not him but as ever her(all brust into laughter,Lillie unocntrollblay laughs  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing) then said I feel bad for my sweet little big sis that is Lillie,the terms are sweet little elder sis that is Violet and finally sweet sweet DaisyDevil(all laugh) she is just like my big sis you know those two I can get under their skin so easily like my mom cause they’re naive(all laugh) Bithie isn’t that patient though too soluble in glee(all laugh a lot) no Daisy’s name was distorted only after the Cerulean massacre as became too happy(all laugh) so says you see my sweet little big sis was in a similar situation ages ago as I was at Kalos and Gary was too after returning Gary recovered quickly after the initial shock cause he anyway never was interested in anything that wasn’t about the despondency of sanity and it’s unfodlment so was ok but Lillie is too sweet hence was trying to get through the despondency by being sane perfectly an endeavour that only people like that dumb buffoon has succeeded exactly why he’s so(all laugh)..yeah this is univerversal term for Trace so no trouble for me either since day one(all laugh and cheers for DR JACKAL,all laugh even more)..yeah absolute embodiment of that name(all laugh,Seth cheers for AH!TRACEY!TRACEY!so maddening the tune!,all laugh even more,Tracey sheakes his head laughing) anyway then says since then Lillie became suspicious of all human relationships of that type(all laugh) so appeared a bit frivolant in general was nothing all of them knew they can’t stay single since they became 14(all laugh) Mehu found me day 0,Violet is too naive in-born trait(all laugh) Daisy just missed Trace at Kalos waters don’t have strict borders(all laugh a lot) and then Lillie were there they were just talking with people politely as we were cause of our positions at our career and all but this may mean something else as my Golisopod says how can you be assured that you are nice unless you’re not so(all burst into laughter)**


and yeah Mrs Waterflower Skechit forgot her middle name being too infatuated with the latter as the jackal said a Tracey treads the water picks the flower to give it to his master never to her(all brust into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..and yeah Dr Skechit thought if I call him Mr it’s derogatory to his so demure beau hence she will not only whisper too(all brust into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..Trace is 48 now Daisy is 50 I know both for 21 and 24 years respectively PHYSICALLY(all brust into laughter,Tracey and Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh) and as you know they have two sweet dolls of a year now almost mentally still(all laugh a lot) yet they thought they need to be sentimental if one was accused of infidelity the other would point out the fact that the effective psychophysicality remains the same anyway hence why bother about the other if there’s so many others(all laugh),I said you accused Daisy of all people of this and didn’t expect her to not boot you(all laugh),Lillie too(all laugh),and it was directed to their models infact how can you know another Dave without knowledge of other how(all brust into laughter),but you know Dave the strangest thing I noticed was that both those two being accused of that confessed their longing for their beaus that’s not a self defense is it Dave is it as would never said any flight attendant exam fail Luvdisc(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter),and the trouble was that because they aren’t separate their beaus thus point their fingers to them making it a cauldron of continuous convulsion Dave of genderhood exactly my very first words to your sis all those 24 years ago wasn’t I being logical Dave wasn’t I Dave wasn’t I rhyming with Darkrai(all brust into laughter,Mehadi in tears and fits of laughter in silence  oy,Seth laughs a lot  er),I said hence that accusation exists only because of difference thus one must cease to be as much as he can then the opposite forces themselves will make sure of the vanishing portions thus my sis was excruciatingly tortured today according to elusive dragonic scales of perfection that simply is inexistent wasn’t she(all laugh),indeed exactly why you’re her bro individually too just like Dr jackal and Mr Oak and another whom I will talk later about cause he became a pro the latest(all laugh) don’t create a difference Dave like a great man will today whose professionalism I just talk about cause I won’t be polite to my 10 year long travel companion who is my compeer across myself and Mehu’s big bro for eternity for God’s sake(all laugh),and he will feel it you know(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) then said you know when he met your sis first she was just a kid starting out found her soulmate was too happy as was he(all laugh) same case for her and his elder siblings then they saw their big bro walk in and instantly tell his poor little sisters something that I can never say no matter(all laugh)..”

Seth(laugh) : “well you see Dave we had Iris a couple of nights back so grand the salad(all laugh) but today we want to confess our longing for you SECOND TIME(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “yeah I’ll get the same at home too thus(all laugh)..anyway today I’m roped in cause of what I heard of some illegal devices used by Zed on that day of the great date(all laugh)..man some wicked brat that is(all laugh)..it was the very first prototype that came to Kanto in a piece of one he managed exactly that insinuating to Lance’s bosses as usual who ever has wanted to avoid the compendium at all cost(all laugh)..it is just Arnie’s conversation with the other may be even more outrageous brat than compendium that no Elite4s wants to hear of the one and only wise one(all laugh)..yeah poor Margin as usual was marginalized(all laugh)..and the way the prototype worked to do the most absurd thing it was smuggled out of Sinnoh Elite4 custody by the same brat(all laugh)..no just a veil of honesty you know still counters(all laugh)..the ones who operated were just Lotery and Tannie(all laugh) and Artmie played the neutral part(all laugh) it was done for specifically this one record and as I was saying Team Rocket tried to catch the interaction of two brats and then record it down as it appeared to a person and thus you know that it’s illegal(all laugh) then in general their internal communication unless directed are never at the same frequencies and all hence also it was as much absurd that bro never uses one as does Gary(all laugh) Brock not needing one is rather obvious(all laugh) but still it’s not possible to do that for 7 hours in an absurd situation like that(all laugh) and yeah that method was straight out of Team Rocket’s books hence illegal too(all laugh) anyway thus Zed told Margin to use this to gauge bro’s state and all and gave bro one too which was just a paper-weight with a string attached(all laugh) anyway then that had recorded the full conversation but then the most troublesome part was how to sync it with bro’s conversation with sis and they moved around a bit during all those hours but this could be and was recorded separately by only a pure fire pseudo-legend(all laugh).. and that brat Minnie just hid Arnie completely in process hence none knew of there situation and all extreme complicated machinary that Margin came to know after bro left then namecalled Zed left and right as he informed him(all laugh) Zed as usual said it’s more promising Margin if on-hand solutions are known(all laugh a lot) anyway then that was safeguarded out of the lab by Margin via Tallie as Gary and those infatuated little brats started squabbling(all laugh) yeah the whole world wants to be my younger sibling too(all laugh) anyway still took 3 years none knew how it would be done and all but it was at the care of Clem and Miette(all burst into laughter,Seth shakes his head laughing) it was a sensational project anyway cause was most confidential and their mental mentor was the obvious exuberant one(all laugh)..that brat continued to pester them if their demeanor seemed dull to him(all laugh) anyway then that was done and then Zed fetched it I’ve heard the full for the last two days and no it was most brutal torture that even Team Rocket would think twice(all laugh) sis wasn’t well which definitely did aggravate that situation but still if the full went out bro would’ve been lynched(all laugh) which ofcourse would’ve countered the executioners when they would’ve understood that the neither physical pain nor mental separation can be anything to beauty(all laugh) anyway those two have finally got their deserving they ofcourse were in constant touch with bro since poor Senor was tormented(all laugh) they knew the reality which isn’t far away at all I guess bro I’ve been whined to speak with the pest too many times last week(all laugh)?

Seth(laugh) : “well then so I come out of Lumburg beauty parlour unscthed finally after knowing 15 times more than I wanted(all laugh)..and I just can’t supress the laugh I had in my mind listening to the account of the men it was so funny(all laugh)..but I’ve never roasted it so I will now(all laugh)..cause my Gyarados is too much dangerously 17(all laugh)..” Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “in your face you namecalled crook(all laugh)...who’se your beau(all laugh) bring that namecalled Mantine singer(all laugh)..” Violet(laugh) : “well Brock told me wisely pointing out that the demon-boy is too radical for life(all burst into laughter)..” Brock(laugh) : “well the trouble for me is that I’ve never seen such politely friendly brats ever(all laugh) and now whole contest system has been foisted upon me and now again back to all square to to designations rechanges(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “well my SOURECS(all laugh) meanig a Mr Pierce Amkuret,specialist in information extraction hall of fame in Sinnoh(all laugh) informed the beautiful men via Dave from before so now the men know and anyway prepared their grand ovation(all laugh) and all then gets into coffee after lunch(all laugh),’um..we guess our compeers there(all laugh)?’,’well no compeers will be separately handled don’t bother(all laugh) I wish to know the phenomena of a name that was associated with a certain Ms Mehadi Waterflower(all laugh) and for that matter it’s surprizing that how a random stranger like me got associated with that name(all laugh)....’,’um..can we take our time(all laugh)’,’yeah sure but I still don’t understand the logic behind leaving a region out having enter it(all laugh) then jumping at the other region that too at a type of gym that’s exclusive to it among all places(all laugh) which has I don’t know has 1000 mega-Zekroms(all laugh)..cause they cherish them so much(all laugh)..that pest said yesterday,a flower will be deemed beautiful if you allow your emotions to flourish(all laugh)/not realizing the water it takes to fetch itself the nourish(all laugh)/similarly this idea you have which wants to make you Seth(all laugh)/fetches objects like the SOMBRE STAT never in congruence to you just your own action to make them so without realizing what it actually does is only adding your idea of being you with just another form presented in transcriptions as the back SLASH(laughs a lot,all burst into laughter)..*


..man that brat is something..cause I don’t understand hunting for men who are in no contact what-so-ever with even managers(all laugh) for 5 years no matter the public gospel(all laugh) says..’..’um..well then
definitely we will require time(all laugh)..you see there’s a certain school(all burst into laughter)..’,’um..sorry to interrupt but that’s like 32 years now(all burst into laughter)..’,’no no see we know as
much as you know(all laugh a lot),cause Zipgarnet Forest Lake is universally known(all laugh) and that’s what we’re talking about(all laugh)’...by the way this is after they gave their career and current personal life of all(all laugh) briefly in 6/7 minutes(all laugh) and was ADVISED how to Palkinize it(all laugh a lot) just said that look men don’t get emotional in life so easily and don’t go to Unova with only one Altaria(all laugh) cause each Zekrom preys one(all laugh) unless he’s WOKEN(all laugh)..


that too at a general dragon gym at a town seething with years of injustice having lost it’s glory thus seeking the most perfect revenge having give a very recent chance at it cause each Reshiram cherishes this environment the most(all laugh) atleast travel as a trainer get a few Zekroms and Reshirams and then go(all laugh) or atleast a Salamence(all laugh a lot) as I would to get a few CILI WHERE’S KOMMO-O(all laugh),man you’re 44 you know way more than halfway through your damn career(all laugh) just cut this language(all laugh),what is it Cili that you start at 17 only get to spend your days with your family after 67 not your children but theirs the most captivating(all laugh) if you’re in hall of fame that’s the reality Cili responsibility ain’t it(all laugh),yeah yeah that’s why the tickle masters are important just move it(all laugh)..anyway those men start,’school this sit was reserved for this(all burst into laughter) and then the Gyarados did this and that(all laugh) all beyond formalities were scoffed off boys and girls boys were rather strenly and girls even more so(all laugh) cause the first lot didn’t know what is boyhood second were too infatuated with it(all laugh).. and so on but whole world knew how the Gyarados’ best-beau-husband-friend would be(all laugh),anyway(all laugh) and that knowledge was especially shoved down the throat of poor born to be MRS HALMSLEY(all laugh),DON’T DARE TO SPOIL MY SWEET,anyway(all laugh),it’s imperative Kane ain’t it that I remind you of the sweetness that you’ve admitted of yourself despite the appearing roughness(all brust into laughter),yeah too much bonhomie(all laugh) exactly why my children aren’t entering this forsaken profession(all laugh)..anyway so men continued this and that and so on and then which subjected fetched which marks(all laugh),I said but marks(all laugh),no that’s the key(all burst into laughter),I said well I’ve had the opportunity to know her personally,anyway(all brust into laughter),so I do know that that wasn’t really captivating was it(all laugh),no no that’s the high school reversal(all brust into laughter),behind me Gengleye was there(all laugh) said like he means local tickling becomes vocal only when your cognition makes it focul rather that which is universal(all brust into laughter,cheers for Tickle Mastery,all laugh even more)..so I was in a precarious situation really(all laugh)......so my Gyarados’ whole school life was re-foisted upon me and so on(all laugh) then young flower dream phenomena and it’s detailed Cerulean analysis(all laugh) how if the Gyarados wasn’t there nobody would’ve given a fig(all laugh a lot)..I said mates she had a damn Palkia with a forsaken Kyurem(all laugh),no that’s the synthetic part you see(all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in silence  oy,Seth laughs at her and keeps tendering her),so I still said,but that’s disrespectful to Palkia,Suicune,Articuno,Jellicent,Golduck,Volcanion,Primarina,Manaphy,Tapu Fini,Tentacruel,Lanturn,Bruxish,Sharpedo,Slowking,Castform,Carracosta,Kaledo,Weavile,Drednaw,Rotom,CORSOLA(all laugh),Nihilego,Milotic,etc who were infact the one who got her the accoledes Gyarados could only scare the kids the pros just laughed at the untamed stature(all laugh)..exactly why she is mad now(all laugh),anyway(all laugh),no was an infatuated disciple of none other than Violtine hence no wonder is WOKEN(all laugh)..I give you the list except MagmortGolem who won’t return for that matter(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing),Brock’s Golem,Cradilly,Dialga,Garchomp,Zygarde and Diancie(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing),Daisy’s Kyurem and Regice(laughs a lot saying SWEET SWEET DAISYDAISYL,all laugh,Mehadi laughs lot in silence,Daisy too laughs a lot) and then Lillie’s Volcanion and Ninetails obvious types(all laugh) they are next along with Gary’s whole bunch(all laugh)..Mehu’s many many brats will be spoiled not all though the two dragons or Rotom won’t too much battle too much bonhomie and may be not Goldy but this can be a veil too for each of them like Chu(all laugh) but most certainly it won’t be used in case of Silvally(all laugh)..some brat that has become already(all laugh)..


Mantine can’t be spoiled this term same as Marill and her compeers,Lillie’s whole bunch can be if she herself doesn’t try which she will cause that’s her nature and Mr Oak can’t do a damn thing about it cause that’s implausible(all laugh,Lillie laughs a lot  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing)..Trace’s brats has no chance but Venonat and Scyther is evocable(all laugh a lot saying AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..Brock’s bunch is a strange phenomena now all the more so cause they are under the care of Oscar the great professional now whose bunch themselves aren’t exactly stable mentally that is(all laugh)..so may roam around the spheres that Goldy does now(all laugh) but except those two Daisy’s bunch can’t be spoiled this term either(all laugh,Daisy says,YES KETCHUM!STOPPED YOU PSYCHOLOGICALLY,all laugh a lot)..now these are only my opinions not theirs(all laugh) but no don’t worry at the time of transmigration all will have same capacity including Mantine so it doesn’t matter afterall that’s what it’s all about for us atleast living our life all these things gross and subtle as Zed ever told us the only time you have to pass(laughs as do Goran,Gary and Stash,rest smile,Lillie,Poppy and Mehadi smile looking at Gary,Goran and Seth respectively)


,so men say,’no you see that’s the gateway(all burst into laughter)’,so I said but still she has a Crawdaunt and a Samurott and Jynx and so on who have scared many champs too(all laugh),no the Gyarados created the myth(all laugh)..


then finally I get to know what my sweet Gyarados was doing with a ponytail(all laugh)..,too sweetened due to the occasion(all laugh)..,so men said everyone knew about Seth Ketchum(all laugh) well Irene certainly knew(all laugh) and yeah,they asked me Kane is your schoolmate right(all laugh),I said,yeah kindergarten stuff too much bonhomie(all laugh) they said,well she told us what you said after McShin cup(all laugh) that your Feraligator was taught to self discover the way to surmount his own existential despondency(all burst into laughter) which he compelled the Team Rocket boss to do that is(all alugh)and then the Sinnoh trophy and all understood that Gyarados is atleast not battle starved(all laugh) and after Sinnoh we were told that all got you on your Chu and you said this idea of electricity is this invention of
the power of nature that has it’s own visible and tangible effects which makes an electric type egotistical and Pikachu is a pokemon that can misbehave cause he feels insecured as Pichu is like normal little pokemon and Raichu is extremely strong as we know but the middle stage is a hard one as it appears to the middle stage(all laugh) and hence they must be made aware of the idea of appreciation of art and literature(all burst into laughter) that is why we do things despite knowing that the result isn’t staying constant it’s an insatiability inside that forces us to do and we may become better with this idea of self less ness but at the end of the day why defend own actions cause your natural state dictates you don’t want to do anything to being with(all laugh) hence this idea of art is ingrained in that fact that we must get that same joy of inaction into this thus a Chu may be asked to destroy the food given to him mentally by extracting the most out of it mentally not physically(all burst into laughter) then he will get starved and will complain that his master is torturing him then he will be told this art of torturing is so maddening but why(all burst into laughter) then he will realize its his own ego that has been hit so he will become thoughtful of why this ego is so maddening(all laugh) and he will get understand this art of ego that is it only gives a hallucination of more while the actual is less(all laugh) thus he will then try to find the less to make it more which he will fail to do cause the less too is ego of insecurity contrasting the more(all laugh) so ego is self contradictory now he will find this art of ego and will get rid of it to surpass his own being then returning to use his idea of ego to manipulate the hallucinations and hence giving an idea to the opponent that he is intriguing thus the opponent can’t be assured of himself cause he’s at bay with himself and Chu as well thus this idea of battle starvation comes if you want to win don’t win at all,if you want to be don’t be at all,if you want yourself don’t be the self at all(all burst into laughter) oh yes,this idea too is to be crossed out to begin with ofcourse,thank you(all burst into laughter),now this time you were pressed more cause your then girlfriend this gym leader was pressed so she complained to you we guess(all laugh),I said,well I doen’t remember the occasion but I can tell you the method is to forget everything as much as possible and try to get rid of the idea of being along with the idea of everything else cause you can see this very being is the root of the being(all laugh) hence self contradictory thus is false and we perceiving that surely isn’t that to being with(all laugh) thus just glide through into the concentration of bliss from happiness what my Yveltal says as you know(all burst into laughter) the idea is honesty of morality of honesty of ethical honesty of ethics of honesty(all laugh) I guess you know my Guzzlord too all were tested(all laugh),said yeah,due to fortunes(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah he repeats these many times cause that is the only thing to do nothing else so being honest to the being itself that I’ll see through it is all that can be done the idea of seeing through is the little happinesses and then the bliss the more concentration and so on hence always cogitating over that by all means as much as possible is what is there all about that is and hence my bunch does a bit as much as they can but your bunchs may do the same if you do that is it’s universal(all laugh) they said,yeah may give a thought later(all laugh) but this was told to them as well(all laugh) and this was around the time when you left for Unova and this all heard and was propagated and we realized this isn’t a sane person’s idea at all(all laugh) cause whole world is a philosophical endeavour to them thus they don’t know who they are and where they are at which age of what evolutional type(all laugh) this the gym leader said is the reason why your bunch are never sane since day one of your career and the other way around the most so it’s just the circulating thing hence rather like a fluke but that word itself has no meaning cause none says that if they are born as Kyurem(all burst into laughter) I said yeah pretty true(all laugh) but appreciation is one thing too much of it is another cause after all the tickets weren’t legal(all laugh) said,no even if caught the positions would’ve thrown them off cause surely we could pay too much(all laugh) I said,yeah absolutely(all laugh) but for that reaches in certain places were needed(all laugh) said well your contact was there(all burst into laughter) I said but that was just the general not personal(all laugh) and furthermore I was being accused of being everywhere as well just one more and then given the positions would’ve insinuated Team Rocket only would’nt it(all laugh) said yeah may be the trouble would’ve been solved after all if we just said check your Tauros(all laugh) cause he would’ve said like hunger of the hungry and that of the not so are in essence same independent to time and space but why(all brust into laughter) I said,yeah hence they rather spared us for themselves(all laugh) they said yeah for us we only saw Gyaradoes that was still comprehensible by not being so(all laugh) but a true Gengar(all burst into laughter) I said I guess you know a few people there at Cerulean whom I know as well hence I’m intrigued by you people cause I guess among that group you were revered rather(all laugh) and hence my amusement as well why would out of blue people jump not the fire but way worse at Huntelion(all laugh) they said,well the contrast of Gyarados that is(all laugh) I said yeah,I realize it hence the illusion even more(all laugh) they said,yeah pretty much hence tantalizing(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah excellent exactly not if the subject is HUMAN(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and the trouble deepens only if genders are involved ain’t it(all laugh) that are too strangely HUMAN(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..” Tracey(laugh) : “you brat why so much bonhomie with that lunatic Gyarados of your’s huh surely at 17 only spit and..(all laugh)..” Mehadi(frown,irritated,Seth same pose laughs,) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh) you were too infatuated with that namecalled Dase hence volunteered for the chief butler’s post without pay(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “cause the notice said needed a HUMAN(all laugh)..just so naive(all laugh),anyway(all laugh),then they said yeah,which never appeared in the true case and hence the truth(all laugh) I said yeah life is strange(all laugh) like Gengar(all laugh) they said,yeah if only the equality is better described at certain places(all laugh) I said,well if the attempt is made except the realiztaions of those who say it’s hard isn’t it cause you don’t get that idea(all laugh) they said yeah but this attitude that our soulmates have..(all burst into laughter) I said,no it’s a matter of emotion due to the existence in the prsent state of being of a particular gender that appears cause there’s another and that is there cause of the idea of gender to being with but the unfoldment is from natural to subtle so it must be given the respect(all laugh) they said yeah that’s true but these sort of accessories are great(all burst into laughter) I said,well this from my Heracross actually(all burst into laughter) I looked at their breeding season and they are like ever another(all laugh) now if you translate that to our plane it’s just hence honestly why bother(all laugh) now men were so happy(all burst into laughter) said,everywhere then(all laugh) I said yeah hence life companionship the rest is the rest but the essence is hence usage in right proportion only looking and finding the present as my bunch says not gently that is(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) they almost hugged me to death(all laugh) said,hence why bother at all just the idea of self as much then the other way around as same so is the reciprocation and hence actually no difference at all(all laugh) men after this almost fainted in too much glee(all laugh) so I said yeah this and this book most engaging(all burst into laughter) said well,those are infact theories we only read a few excerpts from internet heard a few and so on but through representations influenced certain press conferences we realize(all laugh) but do you know Mrs Irene Cobter Halmsly(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah due to the Halmsly part I guee is this question(all laugh) said yeah,ever an extremely nice person and the very few the Gyarados trusts actually if not only cause the Gyaradosy dictum says I’ll ride on your shoulders pulling your hairs and ears and namecall you(all laugh) if you retort then I’ll go to my best friend(all laugh,Seth and Mehadi smile at each other) and if he’s not there why is he not there he should be(all laugh) this is the philosophy of personal life of our Mehu Gyaradosy flower(all laugh) well this is most Gyaradosy but the her sisters are extremely dangerous as well(all laugh) the sweet little big sis says Gary Oak must be Mr Oak professionally but shut up now you’re at home(all laugh) so that swinging is something(all laugh) exactly why Mr Oak says yeah I’m so sweet but hush!professionalism! This is Mr Oak(all laugh) hence ever is trapped(all laugh) so then the elder expressive sister says,I’ll go fully expressive without any limits,you crook(all laugh) manage me or else(all laugh) so the crook says,this idea of being HUMAN just so naive(all laugh) thus gets in trap by everyone(all laugh) but then(all laugh) AH!SENTIMENT IS ABOUT BEING HUMAN!(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs)..so the eldest big sis dictates that I’ll be most reponsible with everything more than needed of course(all laugh) hence I’ll get mental strains hey you jackal(all laugh) thus finally the jackal says,observe,if only time erect the ears up,jump,repeat(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) hence the Daisyl ever gets in traps(all laugh) this whole family barring me including extensions just so naive(all laugh)..surely I actually want to ask the epitome of naivety this(all laugh) really Brock am I naive(all laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “well if I say the legendary reply twice handed out to Trace and Team then what happens(all laugh)..” Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “I’ll teach Flores to pull Oscar’s hairs professionally(all burst into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh)” Brock(laugh) : “man,if mom sees this and knows the teacher I’ll be expelled(all laugh)” Violet(laugh) : “hence it’s AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh) and for you Gengar(all laugh) it’s said none sane asks a complete stranger that too a girl who is most Gyaradosy as was seen by him the day before that,’um,Mehadi,you will travel with me now officially registered but don’t mind my words this I must say for the sake of myself most that you see being of my gender there is an idea of that of yours(all burst into laughter) so I mean if you want to reconsider then please it’s not a trouble..’(all laugh) and Mehu barely managed to not fiercely attack the Gengar then and there(all laugh) and this is just so naive(all laugh),anyway then we call the brat and get the utmost cunningly dense brat(all laugh)..Dase says you know Viol exactly why Cerulean is such happy-go-lucky these days these sort of brats aren’t given a good beatdown at home at early age(all laugh),I barely managed to desist saying just like Ferfetched(all laugh)..so then Lil says,um..but why would he refuse to travel with a girl if he has ideas(all laugh),I said just ask any Cresselia(all laugh) then I actually after I calmed down understood that this brat is a heinous pro(all laugh) so must be dealt cunningly(all laugh) hence was waiting for Mehu’s reply cause I thought he will try to be too caring still(all laugh) and then Mehu eventually tells us, Seth..um..my friend..um..my travel compnaion Seth(all laugh) is very caring don’t worry he’s so sweet um..nice..um..good(all burst into laughter)..’..so I said hmm..Seth lad..hmm..(all laugh)..pokemon master..hmm..(all laugh),now just come into the path of siniters(all laugh) and then later Mehu said,he takes care of me(all laugh) I just told her see how many ways to express the real infatuation(all laugh) exactly then I understand what sort of a cunning pro this brat is cause Mehu strangely says,um..no he never refuses to admit it himself that he has to be cautious of ideas that he calls genderous(all laugh) so sweet Seth..um..he(all laugh) is..um..very nice as a um..person..(all laugh) and yeah also he observes me whole day(all burst into laughter),so I screeched(all laugh),um..no just the topmost portion of my face above the tip of my nose 360 degree(all burst into laughter),so given his own introduction over phone to us(all laugh),I thought what lunatics have usurped our baby and how dare that naive crook let it happen(all laugh) actually we didn’t intervene day one cause Dase said will quit once gets into the forest(all laugh)..then we heard no the brat is too thoughtful and too abstract(all laugh) so Dase said once the first failure comes will budge yet to be challenged then came Pewter challenge(all laugh) so then after that we didn’t have to do anything only cause none other than the philosopher was around(all laugh) then I ask him who is that damn brat(all laugh) kick him out of your group(all laugh) he said like,um..Viol dear..I mean Ms Waterflower(all laugh) don’t worry the observations are more than well reciprocated(all laugh) and the pest himself tells me that a girl is our travel companion yet look she’s still a girl in this idea how does it go(all burst into laughter) then I was taken aback cause this brat if really wants what he’s talking about then he’s hindering himself(all laugh) he realized it then laughed and told me you see Mr Slate when you think you’re not a girl you imagine one when you see that you’re not a girl you see one don’t you(all brust into laughter) thus there’s a girl Mr Slate everywhere once you know you’re not one Mr Slate how can you know then who is a girl when you have to interact with one(all brust into laughter) Mehadi come here(all brust into laughter)..then you know your baby sis comes up and almost runs him over as usual(all laugh) then the pest tells me Mr Slate this is a girl supposedly isn’t it(all brust into laughter) now if I ask her who here is a girl she,me her idea of herself of myself my idea of myself herself of the existence,of the consciousness of a being as a being Mr Slate who exactly is a girl(all brust into laughter) now at this your sis barely manages to not literally devour him up(all laugh) then says you see Mr Slate she is a girl exactly why I must remain cautious of her don’t I cause she thinks the same thus this travel companionship is just a vein to say why would the difference persist Mr Slate if only I was the one who have claimed to be the only that to me actually exist(all brust into laughter)..Mr Slate a girl and a boy might get engaged in a situation developing over a period of time irrespective of the quantity of the length that might be categorized as the eruption of assimilating dichotomy of appearing indifference from quivering to oscillating(all brust into laughter) hence it gives into the glaring difference again Mr Slate making it even more effulgent blinking across the motions of thoughts as they appear to the thoughts that indeed I’m not she(all brust into laughter)..to avoid which either of preferrably both must be cautious of the other rather being accustomed to the other Mr Slate how else can blood and sweat become something to BEAUTY(all brust into laughter)..but you see that falls once you have to engage in a talk with a girl the topic of which takes you beyond psychophysicality hence nothing exist here Mr Slate how then knowing it can you at all term yourself to be not a girl how Mr Slate how(all brust into laughter) but as the appearing difference persist in general plane of mistaken illusion of being a HUMAN(all laugh) Mr Slate how can I be at ease with the differences never having ceased that I’m a boy(all laugh) Mr Slate how can you negate your own shadow of being yourself hence she terms her as herself never him isn’t it(all brust into laughter) hence I have to be cautious of blood and sweat Mr Slate not Mehadi Waterflower cause that never exists thanks(all brust into laughter) rhyms with Machamp whose that pokemon Mr Slate rhymes with Banette whose that pokemon too Brock rhymes with Hitmontop whose that pokemon Brock who Brock who(all UNCONTROLLABLY LAUGH,Seth uncontrollably laughs  ehadi,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in silence  oy)..so you see Ms Waterflower I’m sorry that I said all these absurd things but this is exactly pertaining to what the pest says all time as his common language day to day(all laugh)..then I heard this and was intrigued as well having a degree in music of all subjects(all laugh) cause this case wasn’t fitted with expressions(all laugh) as was Dase cause this can’t be removed by sentiments(all laugh) and I was 23,Dase 25(all laugh) so Lil at 21 said,if he claims to know so much about beauty just ask him how to maintain that type of a steady tan(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) well later it was revealed as just the smooth life of a Gengar(all laugh) then later Brock says,this pest is getting even more extremely abstruse to other girls with each passing encounter(all laugh) but after along with the keen observations seems doesn’t want to admit that your sis is one(all burst into laughter) then we were so scared(all burst into laughter) then Mehu was summoned and she said SHUT UP!(all laugh) it’s cause I look way better than everyone including you all namecalls combined(all burst into laughter) and Seth likes only me..um..corroborates(all burst into laughter) then it was learnt that the pest is only interested about one girl but that unfortunately had to be our baby sis(all laugh) who we found out wasn’t a girl at all by most rigorous logic(all burst into laughter) later after abstract training methods and all came up and Mehu was observed day and night and we realized it’s like a Daisyl observing her(all laugh) so the Daisyl said too much bonhomie(all laugh) I scoffed at her saying greatest caring husband and Lil said hum,ask her how many flower bouquets(all laugh) no pest does what you did in the first month to your wife unless both are pokemons(all laugh) Mehu said pesters me sometimes and all but just no reactions at all except the observation(all laugh) only later she was playing big sis with gym leading cosmetics then said yeah now too dreamy(all laugh)..but then the two words came(all laugh) and this all suggests that even a Gengar who greets people by saying so(all laugh) is just so naive(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “well,I was eaten up day 0(all laugh) still said that to her cause as I said Mehu is Mehu to me so it all was just so naive(all laugh) and I didn’t want her to take up so much strain in that forest due to me the naturality that is(all laugh) actually wanted to marry her then and there by saying you’re not a girl to me never in any time(all laugh)..anyway,then back to AH!BEAUTY!BEAUTY!(all laugh),so they continued to inquire my knowledge on my familiarity with my friend’s wife’s name(all laugh) and was saying that yeah Irene you know ever in touch with us despite everything and since the beginning says both she and her husband Kane are fed abstract ideas like approaching a sick and mad Tentacruel with this question the sickness of the poison does it harm the quality at all Mr TentaCruel(all burst into laughter) infact these helped us as well we guess the whole world knows about these things(all laugh) I said,well,the recodings are a facility that helps the memory by relieveing the pressure that it already has with this burden of specificity of existential reality of the present being(all laugh) said yeah,hence your presentation today on Palkia,Salamence and Latios has been recorded(all laugh) I said,well all understand my words and meanings so well it’s not that it’s imcomprehensible or something rather the exact opposite(all laugh) like flamethrow the last time I said this was I guess 22 years ago(all burst into laughter) and it didn’t go well with Charizard cause he was against my bro Kevin his former master who forsook him as you may know I guess definitely the 81 including my starter at my first 3 regions whole 6+ years by day(all laugh),said yeah minutes yeah definitely(all laugh),so I said so you see Kev even today told me good riddence man you saved me(all laugh), I told to flamethrow and Charizard said that’s not feasible to start with if you want to pogress with a date is it(all brust into laughter) so I asked him what would you do then,he said ideologically the date happens only cause of me thus I’ll ask myself now as we progress if I was right to be me to start with thus eventually fail cause if I really can judge myself in that way not being me then I can also judge the other way around which makes it the same exactly why I exist to start with(all laugh) thus when I fail I understand the idea is let go of the idea of me while engaging in that very activity that isn’t of any worth(all laugh) thus I efface from myself the infallible dating strategy countering the opposition ain’t it(all burst into laughter),now I tell you I unmistakenly saw that mythical arced wing that I saw at Reutorparsar,Unova(all laugh) surely you can’t misjudge it can you having seen it from close quarters then managing see another day in a civilized building afterwards be it hospital(all laugh),so to save myself I said,so when a;l understands every bot of me and my brats why so much bonhomie(all laugh), thanfully they hid their wings now I thought man been spared for another minute may be(all laugh) so men said,well first all understand your words but never the intentions cause why would anyone tell these to wild brats while dining at their home(all laugh) second expect them to scoff at him saying lad how many backlogs(all burst into laughter) then third and this is what you did as we heard before that you said the girl that’s not so is considerable as a friend or if more then family if my bunch agrees with me only like Scrafty(all burst into laughter) we say this name cause this one on being tested told the researchers this idea to learn only fuels your ignorance cause it’s the duality that’s you yourself or your family hence you see I’m dual type too in appearance so any chance that..(all burst into laughter)..they fled the scene as soon as could cause cause family is still ok no matter how horrifying that would be(all laugh) but this pest wants to enter you that is will fondle your nerves with her realizations on dual philosophy to make you permanently incapacitated mentally(all laugh) and it’s a dark fighting menace one of the most irritating(all laugh) hence this duality of gender if no more there they can enter the family recognizing the appearance of genders only as an appearance(all laugh) and all these tell us why you never said flamethrow cause that’s an idea so an hindrence to rality of it(all laugh) thus your battles were as abstruse as they have been(all laugh) cause while all battle they actually are at philosophical conferences(all laugh) and you were clearing backlogs in training(all laugh) thus all these made us realize what a Gengar is in HUMAN form(all laugh) this the Gyarados herself told us,we once wanted to train with her to see and learn from the methods this was actually before we left for Kanto and then she did agree but we saw great methods of teaching her students(all laugh) too unimanigably perceptive and self established but seemed very dissapointed each passing moment then stopped we regardless of ideas asked what’s the matter cause no matter what we had 3 leagues and a Kyogre which Mr Oak opined with an indifferent face veiling irritation as Mr Oak was on-the-fly intentionally(all laugh) to be of that type being not of that type cause that type was of that type(all laugh) she said,no it’s ok then did continue a bit more but in the end sighed said it’s all one way you know how to know what they think(all laugh)so we got the bonhomie part(all laugh)cause by then we with the whole world knew what was going on in Unova atleast(all laugh) hence realized yeah well this attunement gives her that unique skill but this whole method seemed to be only reflecting someone in opposition(all laugh) cause never tried to counter much unless absolutely necessary out of total surprize but surprizing her is almost impossible unless a certain Snorlax turns up(all laugh) but anyway why are we talking about her skills in details to the opposing refection anyway(all laugh) I said,well before that it’s rather strange this intuition we have being trainers about other people isn’t it(all laugh) they laughed and said,yeah indeed hence also the philosophy suits to remind us whom we handle(all laugh) then I said,well you see when we started neither she nor me had any idea where we were hence went into Zipgarnet Forest without a proper map(all laugh) and then again never learnt what to do at all in terrking life and so on except how to cook and set up a tent none of which she knew herself(all laugh) I had some knowledge on compasses and all but you understand I wasn’t satisfied with the accuracy level hence went to next gym rather than the airport to return for a brief visit to Cerulean(all laugh) to abduct a certain Mehu flower that is(all laugh) then as natual propensities grow I had my contering methods all along and she was as ever too Gyaradosy as you know(all laugh) then we met a certain Doctor Slate(all laugh) whose name is better not mentioned for your well being from Salamences including him(all laugh) Salamencian life dictates the idea of killing AH!JUST SO NAIVE!(all laugh) hence they will not cease before they kill your sanity completely(all laugh) this insinuation to Gengarian philosophy meant men jumped up 10 feets to suddenly appear through to next floor where people fled the scene cause they saw a Salamence digging upwards with that type of a wing(all burst into laughter) then men came down with mega Salamencian wing arc(all laugh) and each of the top floor persons of course saying brought each brat together(all laugh) so somehow I stayed alive without laughing cause Gengeley was behind me to save me(all laugh) then I said,so Doctor Slate helped us with everything we literally rode on his back(all laugh) then he was very nice of course to both of us and then we relaized what we did but she as you see too infatuated with me since the first meeting so obsessively did the exact opposite that I did to enlighten me upon her feelings on that type of similar ways that we were travelling(all laugh) so she picked up this anticipation method and of course that’s who she really is too perceptive about everything but too sweet to do anything about it unless necessary hence never realized the 5117th type of handshake(all laugh,Seth laughs at Mehadi who smiles at him same pose both) so she could anticipate things that I can never do at all and hence my style was all about conutering and her the exact opposite cause she never needed to counter almost always and when had to was a bit predictable that’s the way to beat her in battles unless you can overpower her in the blitz that my sis once managed(all laugh) and the record of our family in-between is Mehu vs May,blitzs total 3 of 8+5 two rounds in 13 minutes and the record is in 8 minutes,Mehu3-0May and in 5 minutes Mehu1-1May,the rest one is tied(all laugh) then well so many have faced Mehu officially as gym leader in journeys Japp lost once,Joel lost once,Iris won once,Dave won one before she got hall of fame,Pulu vs Mehu before hall of fame is Mehu1-2Pulu and I don’t know about the current record Mehu won a few then Pulu too I can’t recall it’s like Percy vs Marc(all laugh) and yeah,Dave and Mehu battle innumerable times so don’t know(all laugh),Mehu’s record at hall of fame now faces Dave each week(all laugh) twice(all laugh) and Pulu once(all laugh) then still Ritch(all laugh),who faced her 5 times in unofficials the record is 4-1 in Mehu’s favour(all laugh),but all before her 1st nomination(all laugh),hall of fame I have no idea infact Iris has faced her 100 times over phone(all laugh) the second line-up for Dave is Jelliogredos(all laugh) hence time saving(all laugh) and Pulu too 4 rounds only one round is sane(all laugh) and Dave’s brats learn these then foist these upon people hence his record is one loss in like 100 matches(all laugh) Pulu too has similar records(all laugh) and that too was 10 months back at Sinnoh(all laugh) and then there was SPEW(all burst into laughter) man this name and tone gets the brat in traps each time(all laugh) CULTURAL EDUCATION(all laugh),Drew’s record is 7 minutes Mehu0-0Shrew and in 5 minutes Mehu3-0Spew(all laugh) so  3 wins out of 4 for Mehu in 5 minutes of all limits(all laugh) well none can beat Drew at 7 minutes(all laugh) so I told Drew man what is with you that you can’t win(all laugh),yeah,FAMILIAL INFATUATION(all burst into laughter) so I said then just SPEW(all laugh)..man,Drew is Drew you know cause he’s a bit Shrew thus only could say please dear I still Drew(all laugh a lot)..man Drewy is smoething indeed like Cili..Cili..(all laugh)..Seth,why are they ordering Larvitars in hoards(all laugh) I said TYRAniTAR(all laugh) well the Tyranitar experiment is going pretty well at Unova of all places(all laugh) as is Garchomp at Johto-Kanto(all laugh) anyway,then I said,so you see if you allow this Gyarados to have her ways she will ride on your shoulders to pull your ears and hairs that,you namecall immediately tell Seth that I um..he..um..(all laugh) too sweet Gyarados(all laugh,Seth and Mehadi smile at each other in same pose)..thus she is great at anticipation and thus her style always understanding what she is doing and hence what she will do next she deletes the opponent thus and whole thing is about plan after plan hence becomes so confident with each passing moment and thus the frowns and scowls and smiles all are so much more sweet sweet(all laugh,Seth laughs at Mehadi who smiles at him in same pose) so you see it’s so hard for me to describe my wife professionally(all laugh) then they said,then we guess it’s like start with one the basic then grow in confidence as you know your pokemons too well and attacks and all but she isn’t ever studious you may know(all laugh) I said,yeah intellectual(all laugh) they laughed and said,that was the only word she ever knew at school(all laugh) I said,still do(all laugh),and that is about yeah the basics she studied well and was the most ardent disciple of none other than Dr Skechit and Doctor Slate so you realize the knowledge base(all laugh) crookedly foxing(all laugh) and then again had a Mr Oak to review her intuitions on-the-fly as Gary Oak(all laugh) so she knows about the basics too well they said,and his teachers know this at the cost of themselves we guess(all laugh) I said yeah my whole bunch was tamed first processed second and woken third,first by Doctor Slate,then Dr Skechit and finally Mr Oak as you see hence Mr Oak doesn’t get his degree either the researches being of that type(all laugh) they said,yeah,hence they are so renowned but looks rather dejected all time(all laugh) we guess effects of () of course(all laugh) cause we saw Mrs Oak later and Mrs Oak(all laugh) looked very same so we realized it(all laugh) I said,yeah,hence none else in the world can be who they are hence the family(all laugh) then they said,but that is the basics on pokemons and how to handle them and the care but the actual battle we knew many of her contacts including Sabrina of course(all laugh),he..he..left me to marry me later(all laugh,Seth laughs at Mehadi who smiles at him in same pose),Sabrina later told me,you brat tackle your wife rightly(all laugh) I said well my bunch does(all laugh),but the main drive and mental food as usual is you we guess(all laugh) I said yeah,just too fond(all laugh) used to not talk about that with me and me the same after her initial days here but you see we both needed break(all laugh) they said,yeah that was both of yours real training we realized(all laugh) then I said,just like Gyarados yeah(all laugh) but do you know what is the Gyaradosy gospel(all burst into laughter,cheers for PLAYBOY,all laugh even more,Seth laughs a lot,Mehadi smiles at him same pose) men became too much excited(all laugh) said yeah yeah that was the mystery(all laugh) I said but you yourselves have one(all laugh) no he is good but just not philosophically sound(all burst into laughter) I said yeah realized(all laugh) then I said the sweet Gyarados dictum of life is about plain and simple blind stubborness over anything she likes(all laugh,Seth laughs at Mehadi who smiles at him in same pose) thus the sweetly ponytailed Gyarados must be asked ‘attitude?’(all laugh,Seth laughs at Mehadi and Mehadi smiles at him both same pose) then she will hug me too dangerously just like Gyarados(all laugh) so then to actually get a Gyarados woken this natural rage of theirs must be upended they are like Tyranitar(all laugh) or Solgaleo yeah(all laugh) or Cobalion,Groudon,Heatran,Rhyperior,Golem,Magmorter,Charizard,Zamazenta,Terrakion and so on(all laugh) and yeah ofcourse Landorus,Thundurus,Tornadus,Genesect,etc yeah(all laugh) mind it none are dragons(all laugh) they said yeah we know the topmost among them to be safe ourselves as their trainers themselves have to know(all laugh),Seth why authority is telling me to inspect Huntelion each 2 weeks(all laugh) then anyway,I said Gyarados dictum thus says we are too powerful hence just the dormant dragonic nature of might and pride comes out too much and being at water are being infested all over the world thus a real meance everywhere in even big rivers(all laugh) then if a wild herd of Gyarados is faced they must be asked of their opinions on the difference of spontaneous vs natural(all burst into laughter) then they will be suspicious of you cause you are with your bunch but they don’t say anything they are rather indifferent though they absolutely must have to be consisted of Phampy and Chimchar mid ocean(all laugh) so they will be become thoughtful as to this is natural for them to get scared and us to eat them up(all laugh) but the spontaneity for us tells us they are hindrence to our pursuit of that mightiest perfection so that we hold sway over ourselves(all laugh) hence actually we don’t really want them but us at this junction a few Choiced ones that has the material to go further into this discussion will surround your boat of ship(all laugh) then you will recall your pokemons(all laugh) else they will be killed cause they are hindering the naturality thus making them become spontaneous(all laugh) then you will question them to show the oneness between male and female(all burst into laughter) they will become very thoughtfull cause they won’t be able to as all the difference is only valid from one point never can be generalized by no means(all laugh) hence this idea will ever cling onto them hindering them to show the oneness(all laugh) cause if they talk about physical oneness they are trapped,mental oneness still trapped then emotional and even the subtle bodies still trapped cause the idea persists(all laugh) hence they should go further(all laugh) and hence they realize this rage is not even to get the breeding season and food and so on and then finally you will question them to give their views on society and freedom(all burst into laughter) then they will realize from previous two that society is thus useless to any aspect just the freedom from everything makes them too happy hence the society is just the expression of that in sharing cause all similar in ideas hence the share and it’s never about power and all cause of the lack of being(all laugh) cause that’s real freedom hence with all these they will realize that this rage is the upended version of that maddening tune(all laugh) hence a Choiced one if lucky may be plural like two Kirilas did to me at Frontier(all laugh)..so the chosen one will by himself go into the pokeball for you(all laugh) but yeah will try to dictate your pace in psychic channels and if not allowed will try to teach you directly by taking you mid ocean trying to force you to create innumerable dragon rage whirls all at the same time while telling you this now veils the hallucinated the idea of throwing a piece of paper to your classmate as he opens it finds the words BLOOD AND SWEAT(all burst into laughter) ever a grand hallucination to be shaded down human(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “I’ll throw your brats out if they and you teach these(all laugh)” Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “then the paper will have pictures of cough(all burst into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “so you see what Gyaradoses do if too Gyaradosy(all laugh).. then I said hence you see that is Gyarados at full potential but about her trainer well,yeah we had discussions a very few just wanted to listen to a few things I say,and you know I ever ask a question on a certain thing then the ideas come to me on how to awake that idea of freedom from within then I become happy so the languages come which my bunch validates or rejects then I have to sit for supplimentaries(all laugh) and she listened to a few then the rest was just me for her and thus the ideas for her of me professionally as well and is a great trainer just you know with that style it’s very much like how the great Laura is,she speaks with her too many times(all laugh) so it’s like her but do you want me to tell you about your style(all laugh) they said,yeah sure along with the fact that how she of all people viewed your methods cause the whole world tried their hands at your methods and the result is that their bunch turned on them(all laugh) why is that as well(all laugh) I said,well about her you see we were in a relationship for a very very long time and thus it was all too natural for us she and me know each other’s style too well but she actually knew since Unova what happened she doesn’t know much just a bit and the current level of my bunch she doesn’t know at all to her then relief that was(all laugh) then she did the questioning a bit but you know that was basic that all do like are you hungry(all burst into laughter) they said,yeah unlike Bayleaf that is(all laugh) I said,yeah certainly(all laugh) but do all 235 too well known(all laugh) they said,well according to the gentleman,Mr Oak and Doctor Slate definitely they are rather benchmarks in insanity currently and the trouble is that neither are they stopping at any mark nor is it shown that any other wild brat or the bunch of anyone else can’t become like them hence a hew of fear surrounds you(all laugh) I said well I realize the fear is just that of Gengar(all laugh) they said yeah only who knows but no matter how much they try others don’t listen(all laugh) I said,well it takes time(all laugh) but then yeah back to styles yeah she did ask a few questions and all but was like me and her we never bothered about profession in between us then and all then no it’s just a matter of perceptions you see some people tried to copy me or even get inspired those who inspired me or got that from me still can’t copy me cause the problem as we all know in psychic channels you can’t be that and expect a result hence the failure of many people trying to copy then they said,yeah people are inspired by you or inspires you may be but none are like this so we realize flukes but is it just that(all laugh),I said well look you surely know what my Kyurem says(all laugh) they said,yeah only appearning as fluke to the born actually nothing is specified cause it doesn’t matter at all at the level of Gengar if two are same or all or none still the individual joy is too maddening as they say(all laugh) to look at anything else hence no secrecy from you and hence others are not at this level cause they are responsible in the thought that they are born(all laugh) I said,well you see we are only one profession in the world out of may be 50000 in only ours as a whole(all laugh) they said,yeah here only we’re saying cause it’s just so absurd that the first rule of pokemons is that don’t let them tame you(all laugh) and you have ever revolted against it as directed by Shiftree(all laugh) so we realize that somehow it’s just about as Kyurem says who she is just nothing else(all laugh) I said,yeah absolutely you see it doesn’t matter cause so many people adore me love me have great affection they never feel any discomfort with my level or skill and personality and antics and so on like Mr Skechit,starting beau Marill,psychothrombonosis expert especially when is used to jump alongside into the Oceans infested with Sharpedo,Gyarados,Volcanion,Kyogre and Palkia(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) thus you see it’s rather who they are that is all about it they are happier than me surely with pokemons not fondling their nerves own pokemons that is(all laugh) but from own then you get more well versed of course to explore the wild hence know many grand philosophers who don’t submit their thesis unless their own mood appeases them to cause they are different to them hence the thesis(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “you brat don’t spoil my poor pokekids too(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “no I heard Edin told Hector that he wants a Grimer as prize(all burst into laughter),told me see why I don’t like your methods(all laugh),then they said yeah we see why indeed Kyurem is so dangerous(all laugh) then they said what about our styles(all laugh) I said well,you are too polite and just very nice men all around and emotional for life(all laugh) what Kyogre told me that is(all laugh) I asked him mate do you relize why you are a Kyogre(all burst into laughter) he said yeah that’s what my master calls me by only during attacks(all burst into laughter) this means he is well tamed sweet little kid(all burst into laughter) but you see emotion is right as well no wonder I understand everything and it’s alright which is not the case with this emotion to suddenly jump onto own soulmate not giving her enough time to settle with her relizations and hence overbearing happiness(all laugh) men almost ate me up with sausage(all laugh) then said,yeah hence studying Gengarian ways to achieve the same(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah best of luck(all laugh) then they said,well after we went to Unova we got our Kyogre trying to dictate our us(all laugh) so then the illusions broke off for us cause we realized if you have been so much adored by the concerened gym leader and you still are a Gengar(all laugh) then Gengar is the reality(all burst into laughter) hence we went into self introspection and realized the illusion as so hence out of it but then we also heppen to be good friends with Irene you see(all laugh) I said,yeah she’s a water specialist doctor in profession and then an extremely sweet and nice person so yeah like rather auspicious company(all burst into laughter) so.) they were laughing for ages hearing this(all laugh) then I said yeah,but I just hope they haven’t or won’t in future disturb you with reports(all laugh) they said no no that’s ok they understand that cause we’ve been so much happier now(all laugh) I said exactly why the soulmates don’t want you to hover around the past just to show the Gastlic evolution(all laugh) they were dissapointed(all burst into laughter) said being a Gengar it’s hard to hold onto things that is it clouds and strains the mind(all burst into laughter) I said yeah I’ve time(all burst into laughter) they said yeah it’s also the anniversary for us you see(all burst into laughter) I said yeah this was the date(all burst into laughter) and today the food excellent,traditional Pasio that is(all burst into laughter) they were laughing even more with the word date in past mentioned tense(all laugh) so realizing the full theory of oneness and appearance happily shook hands(all burst into laughter) I said may be soulmates don’t like me(all burst into laughter) said well the attitude is rather strange cause in a part they are happy on the other hand says is it necessary to actualize the philosophy(all burst into laughter) I said well I agree with her upto the fact that is it necessary to do too much(all laugh) said no that we recognize as well but as your Gengar says Gengar!Ah!so maddening the tune(all burst into laughter) so I said well just have a control that at the end we being human have to do more to be them(all laugh) they smiled and said yeah we understand just today this talk got us the relief(all laugh) I said yeah,most humbled to come into any service(all laugh) but then I said I realized the language but why did you try to hit me seeing Chu with me to begin with(all laugh),said no thought still not a ghost so..(all laugh) I said yeah ghosts would’ve made the situation safer you realize(all laugh) said,yeah only now(all laugh) surely a few are around(all laugh) I said yeah definitely they don’t stay inside(all laugh) then they laughed and said so maddening is this presence(all laugh) I said yeah I concur(all laugh) so then again they continued you see Irene we told a bit about our meeting at Unova and she said ever like that the words and opinions gets people to laugh and realize the Gengar(all laugh) and that’s how the whole bunch and the master ferries(all laugh) then that bro vs beau differentiation came up(all laugh) the whole world realized the Gengar is truly so(all laugh) then Irene said you know his methods were the soulmates are so if and only if are so their vomits(all burst into laughter) psychophisyomotional(all burst into laughter) and this also as according to our contacts and our soulmate’s career and all we came to know a Mr Drew Blackmore is the first hand and the very best witness to these methods(all laugh)we realized how much help that did to him and to Mrs May Maple Blackmore whose name with your career and your with that of her is intricately joined and the reason is that as she says you’re her own big bro and very fond of you and no barring the methods surely looking at their careers we realized why those methods are definitely effective yet so funny just like Gengar(all laugh) so you see this Gengarhood is so enjoying(all laugh) then we also realized how much these helped Irene as well and how much it tormented her husband being schoolmates to Gengars to being with(all laugh) and then his little sister too had be under the clutches of the Gyarados for 6 years(all laugh) and we laughed even harder thinking of the possibilitis if materialized in reality which is so obvious that one forgets to SPEW(all burst into laughter),when you’re about to confess EXACTLY THEN BECOMES MAD AND BITES YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN EACH TIME(all burst into laughter,tears)...man spew is something(all laugh) then beautiful men continued,but then again we understood our soulmates and then realized no wonder Gengar said why bother if the full ticking is to be found which is most maddening(all laugh) I said,yeah the sharing like boiling takes time(all burst into laughter) they said yeah emotional may be are we again(all burst into laughter) I said well with real and true happiness the little fetters like emotions lose it’s confining stench(all burst into laughter) hence Gengars don’t think(all burst into laughter) they said yeah pretty much(all laugh) then they said well,can we ask something about the Gyarados(all laugh) I said why am I so interested about my former girlfriend(all laugh) they said no the dates(all laugh) I said well you see the path is longer so indefinite in scales(all laugh) they said no the trouble for us is the word former(all burst into laughter) I said yeah well,whole world and my close circle too which encompasses a lots of people as you understand the philsophy(all laugh) they all think it’s just that I’m back to marry her only finally(all laugh) what ensures the image is wrong after all many evidences are there where like you people the illusion broke after even may be 42 years(all laugh) they said well they weren’t Gengar to being with(all laugh) and neither were the soulmates absolutley Gyaradosy(all laugh) I said well,Gengars are just an universal generalization so there surely are many out of our profession(all laugh) but yeah being a Gyarados out of here is dangerous(all laugh) but still the intriguing part is why the Gyarados was the big sis generosity embodied who did so much for the city and pushed many projects many jobs were cleared for many people who wouldn’t have got it despite their more than enough qualities and so on had she not intervened and all that contrasting the Gyarados that she is what is the reality was the question and it was found the the reality was the Gyarados so how was the behaviour in the last 5 years(all laugh) they said no the outside was more or less same but rather coiled herself into her and did many things still but much to a lesser degree and most of the things were settled already the vitality that really made the phenomena was never there after you left so yeah it turned out to be totally all about you but we have both directional ideas(all laugh) I said well the supposed bride that was announced after that press is none other than this Gyarados I guess is the idea(all laugh) they said yeah pretty much all know about pictures(all laugh) so yeah relizable(all laugh) I said why this idea that oncein a relationship can’t stay as single afterwards(all laugh) they said,well just too much knowledge of the duality assures that the first hand mental experiences and methods were most engaging(all laugh) I said well,may be but as I said the paths are hence as strange(all laugh) they said yeah but may be we atleast do hope that the announcement is sooner(all laugh) cause may be the Gyarados will go on public and create a sentimental mess confessing to you again(all laugh) I said,well I’ll see what can be done with the Gyarados(all laugh) but can you enlighten us about a certain person who used to be Frucifern gym leader(all laugh) they said,yeah battled him once was with Cobalion(all laugh) during our Kanto endeavour defeated him and the lad was frivolant(all laugh) went to Cerulean too actually(all laugh) but was unofficial match and was Jynx vs the same(all laugh) just got us in the end by the smallest margin possible but later after professional talks said Jynx was the one he said are too exuberent with modality(all burst into laughter) hence the psychic can be manipulated to ghostly parts as well but are no good with darks his words still so anyway(all laugh) so we realized it was living in you anyway still(all laugh) I said yeah was too fond of me(all laugh) then they said that exactly was where the Frucifern leader hit her(all laugh) I said,well I guess the idea of illusion that is(all laugh) said yeah but was after the gym infact you know her name and all that given her personal troubles all combined she was nowhere but they didn’t realize that it was just Reshiram(all laugh) so they continued(all laugh) said,hence wanted to control that gym so that a few nominations and all that you know to get the tags that is and so on many stuffs and your name actually roused her up else was thinking only legal procedures and then just showed why she is who she is in our profession(all laugh) I said yeah indeed once only talent and personality too you saw that bit was infatuation too deep(all laugh) they said well till we were there never seemed to recognize that cause that’s reality we guess but may be we’re wrong(all laugh) or just as you said the path too long(all laugh) I said well,can we discuss about that after the match where you were present(all laugh) said yeah that day was too serious and the line up was something you see the previous leader at Frucifern Mr Giles was a huge name great gym leader and this one is his nephew was good but personally you see(all laugh) and yeah used a Virizion last(all laugh) the line-up was Cacturne,Dhelmise,and Virizion(all laugh) and she went with Gyarados of course(all laugh) if was now whole world would’ve been lulled out(all laugh) it was Tapu Fini,Gyarados,Primarina(all laugh) actually for it was a nasty thing you see illegal stuff hence Doctor Slate’s title helps here if not nullified by his surname(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) I said,well I get so much excitement hearing this story(all laugh) men too happily said yeah we can date here whole night till tomorrow this time(all laugh) I said yeah much oblidged fill up roles theoritically same stuff(all laugh) then they said,well first we’ll ask of your opinions again on of all things gym system and monitoring(all laugh and cheers for PLAYBOY at 1164st,all burst into laughter,Seth laughs a lot) so Mehu’s playboy at 1164st said(all laugh),yeah,I realize the systems you see a badge is given out so if you beat 7 time champs after 9 months in a gym with Carracosta vs Kyurem(all laugh) surely you deserve recognition(all laugh) and then still the badge has to be dished out to the challenger for fulfilling certain criterias that too has be decided by the gym leader according to manuals hence Jaheem is the best gym leader who hasn’t got a gym(all laugh) and the challenger who being 7 time champs will have to tell the authority what he or she did in the match cause the badge should be given the other way around you see(all laugh) surely a 22 year old can’t judge a 34 no matter what(all laugh) then these things will be recorded and monitored and so on I don’t like this idea of pests jumping up and down for a badge impolitely and the leader being too reponsible for them that’s all(all laugh) they said,yeah we guess Cerulean will be renovated much in coming days despite the common thoughts given the donations Pasio has received already and we ourselves passed a few cheques and else(all laugh) I said,yeah we’ll see what happens(all laugh) but what did Doctor Slate do then(all laugh) they said,well the trouble started after that brat went overboard not realizing chosen Giratinas were entering universities then(all laugh) yeah and we guess also two years got suspended for shoplifting at professor’s other half’s in-law home(all burst into laughter,tears) then Dr Oak Dr Oak finally unwigged the wig(all laugh) you see we went to Kanto the month after you broke-up(all laugh) finished on the same month Mr Oak and Mrs Oak got married ceremoniously but unnecessarily cause they already were since 0(all laugh) hence only the signature was good,yeah celebration too but the cost of dresses,well(all laugh),actually as you know our careers better than us(all laugh) you know we had been to Cerulean many times and also during Kanto one month was here at 11 city circle the extended parts with Bosangria and Frucifern and infact then also saw that was the month before they realized the one reality eventual,it was May and hence troublesome(all laugh) as usual too as you know the culmination of that FEELING(all laugh) so we thought why the two are wasting their time still(all laugh) and Mrs Lillie wig is someone who doesn’t waste any time at all once determined(all laugh) so 8/9 months for her and then out of which 5 months of total inactivity a bit tickling(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) she looked sinister as well as you know along with her baby Gyarados both were almost similarly lunatic then and were boogey girls(all laugh) it was real scary really(all laugh) rather the scorching days was much gentle then in hope that surely that night is just say 12 hours and given the BMR jackals have to do something during the other half of it with Marill,Scyther and so on yeah(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) so it was scary and sad exactly why Brawn didn’t like it there(all laugh) rather Viol flower was all flowered up cause the crook was not naive for God’s sake for once(all laugh) hence we felt strange a bit anyway Mr Oak was unimaginably solemn then cause of a newly imported Darkrai and a Dusknoir along with him if he alone wasn’t enough(all laugh) and jackal was as usual studying how to rather channelize the BMR hence the masks were rather frequent and less concealing(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) so anyway,then they realized the reality next month in june then got married last day of October and we returned on 30 that was on 31 and we thought well surely we deserve the invitation now cause we were overjoyed(all laugh) but sadly Reshiram was in-charge of the sending postal department(all laugh) along with Talonflame of course(all laugh) so that didn’t materialize(all laugh) and then actually Mr Gary Oak was the one who kept that brat down becoming Dr Oak(all laugh) for long cause despite his insinuations he never bothered and his services there were fine as was the case of jackal but he as usual rather made Mr Oak’s job much harder(all laugh) but then the brats crossed limits so he got rid of the gym much to the dissapointment of Mr Fox cause of the mental pressure Mr Oak was taking before marriage(all laugh) such HUMAN samples are indeed only one and once ever hence only Marshadow and Banette is too(all laugh) but he still consented as he relaized Mr Oak that the time is of that type as said Gary Oak(all laugh) then at this the brat first complained and all created a legal mess against the gym cause couldn’t accuse the lab now as Ms Lillie became Mrs Oak hence the services if were a bit more at Cerulean none could argue against(all laugh) and was only that bit more nothing else which though given who they are meant the nominations were easier to get(all laugh) but the bigger problem was you lab has been accused of many things but never directly cause all know what type of brats live there(all laugh) they can win any court cases by themselves as they literally did later(all laugh) then the troubles started the gentleman tried to Muk it out didn’t succeed(all laugh) then Doctor Slate was also famillially exposed then(all laugh,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) and with her two younger sisters being truly settled now,Daisy was two positive one negetive down hence with the positive mood was about to go into the singualr territory thinking 21 years of long career all things done lets spend my days happily here with pokemons and still won’t say anyway(all laugh) no really I feel bad that I wasted Daisy’s 2 years for no reasons(all laugh) jackal would’ve been kicked into the reservation 2 years earlier(all laugh) actually should’ve sent Hector a letter too(all laugh) then this trouble started and Daisy was very upset with things and then actually the lad made the mistake of directly dragging your name to which had she not been your girlfriend but like sister or family memebr would’ve listened to Brawn and got Crawdauntogator involved(all laugh),Brawn said that infact whole world who knew her personally,knew who her beau is(all laugh) can we say the tense rightly(all laugh),I said yeah,will be reviewed but why don’t we finish with the match(all laugh) men were laughing cause by then whole world who knew me knew what my intentions were with whose ring finger size(all laugh) asked Zara the day before the marriage day itself what your beau gave you(all burst into laughter) she was laughing saying only a Gengar asks for the model from his sis-in-law(all laugh) I said yeah,yeah,too long now so too much bonhomie with that overzealous pest so forgot the model as well being replaced(all laugh) then she was laughing handed it over to Dave who again ate me(all laugh) then finally the name was there well they also had to search(all laugh) too interested(all laugh) but thankfully it was bro and not the sis of all Torchics(all laugh) would’ve lectured me for whole day to SPEW(all laugh),Drew still says man missed you during the marriage you know so many hours to search for the right cost(all laugh) anyway,then men said,yeah Brawn wasn’t happy that a illegal battle would happen so didn’t do much cause he doesn’t like sad sperations rather funny one which means what only he knows along with your Bulbasaur(all laugh) I said well he himself is 235 so his bunch plays the serious role(all laugh) so then men said,hence we never went there officially either(all laugh) I said,did you go to Pewter(all laugh) said yeah never heard of a gym leader midmatch asking um Solrock’s left-upper edge is a bit weak today did you notice(all burst into laughter) we realized why Doctor Slate has become a doctor(all laugh) and yeah Edmond too(all laugh) but of HUMANS(all burst into laughter),then anyway,the plans were there and all then she went there and the prize was as usual you know control of gym and dates and so on with mad professors at Ryrokobstic Forest at Noivern’s most dreaded population(all laugh) actually Noivern is no easy a brat to tame either(all laugh) whole Kalos knows these pests at night(all laugh) that tickles(all laugh) tickle masters are something(all laugh) and they were behind me there whole time(all laugh) anyway,the match took place in February next year actually from December to January was the real trouble anyway,many brats from Elite4 also was there,Lance and Simon consented cause the brat agreed to the terms cause he made her vulnerable as well insinuating to her obvious trouble to her(all laugh) anyway,then first Cacturne vs Tapu Fini was a draw infact was a great match took 37 minutes and then Dhelmise vs Gyarados which Gyarados won after 43 minutes but then came Virizion and smoked Gyarados off in like 10 seconds(all laugh) then was Primarina thus we get a bit interested(all laugh),I said yeah,Primarina life is about concentration of conjugative conformations(all burst into laughter) that is they will say unless you let us take you as a Primarina-to-be apprentice we will kill you instantly(all laugh) thus they will concentrate your makrs of all papers that you give as an exam to give you a grade so that you are either accepted or rejected as a Primarina(all laugh) which includes questions like the uniformity of appearing danger to satiability(all burst into laughter) which means what danger to a Primarina is enough enjoyable(all brust into laughter) which is the question the lack of 4th stage at this chain eat,digest,the undigestable automatically is rejected no more stages why(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) this answer is actually they are expecting thus to engage with them in a meaningful and fruitful conversation on life(all burst into laughter) one must give this answer as the stages that you seek are there in the food itself why is one thing edible another not if you know both are in general food(all burst into laughter) then their chain gets to the physical part thus they make themselves Primarina which they will fail to do(all burst into laughter) cause the premise is that to get out of this body now at this juncture they will ask you what is the reasonbehind the faculty of emotion(all burst into laughter) then you will answer them with this question tell me the difference between emotion and motion(all burst into laughter) then they will be thinking hard about the E that is meaningless alone(all burst into laughter) hence this conjuction chain says all expressions of ideas are meaningless(all burst into laughter) hence they get to the pure idea then they will ask you what is intellect(all burst into laughter) now you will again answer them by questioning them to show you the chain between hallucination and relaity(all burst into laughter) now this is a generalized point to any psychic or ghost like Trevenant,Metagross and so on that I have surely you know(all laugh) this though is to be used only when they are in certain states to be asked this question cause they otherwise will return to this psychophysical state hence you see this whole process needs you to be with them in every step in psychic channels(all laugh) and think like them as well as you at the same time cause that’s what you want as they do(all laugh) as you want them to get tamed and they the opposite(all laugh) thus there are specific medicines(all laugh) anyway,at being questioned thus they will get this in conjuction and realize that both are produced from a relative point of view hence is intelligence but then you further question them another general that why being is necessary(all burst into laughter) this gets them the idea that they are holding onto themselves only projecting their being but then self deluding that they are the the reson of projection as well hence the being has never enough satiability to them thus this being isn’t necessary at all which now will get them to full potential and they will tell you yeah we get it why you’ve made a mistake by thinking that you can be sad(all brust into laughter) thus concentration of conjugative conjunctions conforms fully to this understanding that tell them to remove the despondency of duality(all laugh) thus they are tamed(all laugh) then men were in dreams by then(all laugh),said yeah we realize what happens to the master then(all laugh) and the lab staffs as well along with their families and especially childern if young that is(all laugh) then they said but you don’t have one so actually you can do it with any pokemons can’t you(all laugh),I said not at all these are rather models unlike Salamence whom I did query along with Rayquaza,who was a better college-nerd(all laugh),Salamence said I need to kill my friends so stayed back(all laugh),plus I also only have learnt these after many backlogs which I still get like you know once I was at a forest in Kalos actually when you know my bunch wasn’t normal(all laugh) even then you see this happened that a Raticate came along I asked him do you understand the idea of boredom(all burst into laughter) he said pity lad I feel pity at your lack of education(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) this idea you have that you want to go to the point where this boredom is representative of your urge to get something actually so that infact it regenerates your will to go harder at it by may be trying another thing sometimes and then suddenly get an intuition and go again thus you take boredom as an indication to your interest is only because you’re still at a level of Ratata high school last year last exam supplimentary fail(all burst into laughter) this idea of Raticate is that you get this boredom to not indicate your interest but to reflect upon your interest(all burst into laughter) thus rather than being interested we should be bored all the time shouldn’t we(all burst into laughter) hence only the right things will be caught then you will give your full effort there and then eventually you still will run out of interest cause that job will either end or won’t but you must know so many things that will generate different problems hence this effort to know or do anything of interest is useless cause the interest itself is the reason why the problems are more and more generated after which you run at forgetting the interest that you had to begin with thus you must ask why is there a thing called interest the answer is cause there’s boredom(all burst into laughter) hence if you’re ever bored then eventually all will interest you while you’re bored thus you see total discrepancy hence you realize all the trouble is this idea of being that wants more food cause you’re not happy with your idea of yourself though each moment you know what you are is just that so this validation attempts go on in total futility thus anyway everything is so boring except the unfoldment from in and to insanity of course(all burst into laughter) so why would you be interested to know the ideas of boredom rather than the ideas of generation of spontaneous urge to be a being despite already being one to begin with from an Emirates professor(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) hence lad,don’t sit in the last bench beyond middle school giving excuses that you stood for a few minutes looking around as your bike punctured while ON-THE-FLY(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) so.) you see it’s trial and error to learn these things ever no matter my condition or that of my bunch(all laugh) then men said yeah we realize why Raticates are damn brats(all laugh) and don’t get bored cause they already are hence they search for insanity thus grab our collers to tell us that to them threatening us with massacre(all laugh) I said yeah,normallly that’s the first year engineering project I couldn’t qualify the entrance(all brust into laughter) then they said yeah we understand why she wanted to predict all the time(all laugh),then.)they said well did you tell this chain conjunctive concentration of logic of Primarina to her before(all laugh) I said no just Trevenant’s views I told a Trevenant is only so cause of his own idea of the same hence useless cause I think I’m Seth Ketchum actually we all know it’s a confinement isn’t it(all burst into laughter) then they said,yeah for Gengars(all laugh) then they said well her Primarina was too good and got Virizion his best brat(all laugh) was a hard fought match though but she got it in the end was just as usual seemed too comfortable though her Primarina was in trouble then afterwards she still won with amusingly intuitive moves and the match then took 63 minutes to total 148 actually and then told us that it’s always about mixing the previous challenger’s idea of the her to that of her next brats idea of the previous challenger that he didn’t see(all burst into laughter) but she did so.) that is the continuous chain which gets to to predict things better(all laugh) like when two words may come(all laugh) then they said we realized this predictive chain itself is such great then just complimented her on the win and yeah,Mr Oak was there alongside me who hearing this just said that according to Mr Oak(all laugh) it’s what is called the flagging off of ethical revolution of insanity(all burst into laughter) then we realized that this is so great a way of thinking so later we asked of her opinions on your Kalos final(all laugh) knew that she won’t be nice at all(all laugh) but we were curious as to most of your bunch was known to her so what was her opinion on your style then(all laugh) cause we said that we have much respect for your style but this is totally unpredictable(all laugh) wasn’t nice to us as usual(all laugh) but not impolite(all laugh) didn’t give the answer just said don’t know,just a freak(all laugh) and then sighed and said if he wasn’t would’ve been anyway(all laugh) then we realized the lack of answer was cause that was the answer that hence only my style is anyway(all laugh) and this was just after the gentleman held his ceremony where we were invited(all laugh) met your mom actually(all laugh) was there just for just a little time but we went with Doctor Slate and Mrs Slate(all laugh) Mrs Slate’s views were strange like why would we not come alone(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) and she sang a nice song later on the cake cutting moment,Oscar why didn’t you compliment her,um sorry Florie dear but you know as it’s just her PROFESSION(all burst into laughter,Violet brusts into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) hence was a nice gentle jackaling ceremony without Marill(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy bursts into laughter) and yeah your sweet Gyarados was playing boogey girl then(all laugh) so didn’t spend much time after all her Kalos final was next to next day 01:00 needed to prepare(all laugh) and the cermeony was nice all due to the fact that except Mime no other Choiced pokebrats were there visible that is(all laugh) thus all left unscathed including the gentleman(all laugh) but not Mr Oak(all laugh) as Mr Oak was only present at the cutting moment and all and Mrs Oak looked so dissapointed for this as it was as usual AGIAN(all laugh),during his own ceremony first Dr Oak Dr Oak found all his dresses were Muked(all laugh) somehow his grandpa controlled his wife(all laugh) this was cause the expense was unnecessary which Mr Oak forgot as he forgot to mention Mr Oak marries Lillie wig(all laugh) thus come at this time sorry couldn’t specify it as said Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) then Mr Oak still even on that day tried to go to the lab which Mrs Oak tried to foil(all laugh) but soon found a certain Emboar have sneaked into her own room(all laugh) who asked her this fire you have of emotions(all laugh) how do you know that it’s ideal when you already have an idea of the ideal(all burst into laughter) somehow she managed to flee the scene of her own room(all laugh) now she enquired as to who the culprit was who zapped first Muk inside the cabinet and now this brat in(all laugh) which then wasn’t found out but as Mr Oak was supposed to come to the ceremony after finally getting ready after a field day with Whimsicott as usual(all laugh) where Mrs Oak herself pushed him to cause Emboar solemnly sat on a chair and said this chair isn’t ideal(all laugh) thus the broken chair was turned to sadly ashes(all laugh) so Mrs Oak tried to immitate her elder sis(all laugh) so somehow the brat was kicked out(all laugh) then Mr Oak featured with Whimsicott of course(all laugh) who said how do you know this isn’t the whim of realization but just the realization itself cause you still live in duality hence why bother about the particular but still only as the other(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) so after whole day of these Mr Oak returned as Gary Oak(all burst into laughter) and the he was just about to go to the ceremony,when he found out his jacket hosts Spiritnown(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) who said why bother about another if there’s ever so many others this idea of fear you have of all except this particular other that all are more other to you than this one specifying other thus you don’t bother about yourself but this particular another thus you forget actually that anyone can be this if you’re not not you but any of those that are termed as other thus actually all these proves that no matter what you are infact afraid of yourself only cause this particular other is also you so there’s another and thus anyone isn’t cause of you only but this other is also you which still appears to you as other hence only you’re wrong Mr Oak as you’re not afraid of yourself cause Mr Oak,why bother if this specific is only you thus it’s just you thus where’s you then who is the other(all burst into laughter) so surely he was dispirited(all laugh) thus he opened the cabinet which hosted Celebislash(all burst into laughter),yeah perfect combinations for the ceremony as well(all laugh),hence he could barely wear anything(all laugh),cause he was told you see Mr Oak this progress you are trying your hands at creates a duality after all that it’s me but still only as other thus giving you only more existential difficulties(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus Mr Oak why bother if still no progress is made cause only you too can’t be the other(all brust into laughter) so brilliant combinations(all laugh) and these were the zapping culprits of course(all laugh) this was due to gentleman’s too much glee that he neglected his special duty(all laugh) cause he dared to scoff at pests like Glalie(all laugh) cause he wanted to be serious thus all revolted along with a damn brat Shiftree(all laugh) the soultion was found out in gradfatherly words understand this grand personal connection(all burst into laughter) this insinuated to a Playboy Kethcum again of course(all laugh) thus Mrs Oak cried(all laugh) hence the ceremony was real(all laugh) thus people were happy cause a Yveltal was somehow kept away from there(all laugh) with a Groudon(all brust into laughter) thus next day Mrs Oak went out too unhappy got Snorlaxed(all laugh) who said attacking the attack is just the idea hence crying is no solution to sorrow(all laugh) then he was fondled to death thus is it said in the gospel that,AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh)..and your Gyarados then was bit less a boogey girl(all laugh) so was there for longer time but we weren’t invited strangely as Mr Oak didn’t allow Mr Oak(all laugh),Mr Oak’s ceremony was with much less people and was much formal except him of course(all laugh) everything regarding the decoration etc were upto the cost unlike the dress and psychophysical condition(all laugh),gentleman’s ceremony wasn’t that costly in organization cause whole world was Muked in(all laugh)..but,then talking about the Boulder,then at gentleman’s ceremony this was to be taken care of but by then the lab had a new pest named Heatran(all laugh) and a Greninja was there for briefly but this Heatran didn’t like the fact that she despite being an absolute damn brat was rather more calm(all laugh) so now went to her fullest thus whole group was agitated so as to why the gentleman was happy cause he is attacking them with his happiness(all burst into laughter)cause his happiness is an attack as that being natural to him now why is that too much in him overflowing(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing),this we learnt from Doctor Slate how was our guide in the ceremony as he took us with him there as I told you(all laugh) then this was the reason why Mr Oak had to be held up there till almost 20(all laugh) then as usual came just in time and was all drenched in sweat just the bottles of deos helped(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) then he again left at 20:30 cause news reached his bedroom is hosting a Dialga(all burst into laughter) who was zapped in by Giratina of course(all laugh) and Latios this time(all laugh) so a Dialga in a bedroom at 20:30 at night(all laugh) is a bit discomforting to Mr Oak cause which type allowed him to realized even while zapped how will he have to stand so that all inside the room is intact(all laugh) the hallucinations of trials that is(all laugh) and a Dialga is a 17+ft tall damn dragon(all laugh) plus the sword makes him 21(all laugh) so he had to follow Giti in staying at half subtle state and then as soon as Mr Oak entered he said what means this moment to your sanity(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing),then anyway,we met your mom there and had a few plesantries exchanged and that’s all but the reason Doctor Slate said is to show the downfall of Playboy Ketchum(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) but that was strange cause Mrs Ketchum had a Mr Mime all along(all laugh) seemed very calm but actually is the most wicked brat(all laugh) anyway,then Doctor Slate said this is why I introduced you see what is real pokemon mastery in contrast(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing),we realized just so naive(all laugh) then the ceremony went and yeah we also have been to Doctor Slate’s marriage ceremony at Boulder of course(all laugh) it was rather emotional(all laugh) there were innumerable people of course cause of naivety,expression,type advantage and disadvantage, and professionality of course(all laugh) but pests weren’t there so was nice(all laugh),Mr Oak as usual didn’t come with Mrs Oak of course(all laugh) he was summoned to dicuss the idea of going by walking or going by seeing the pictures if the later forces you to think that I missed it then why the former only is the reason for the later to exist(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollblay laughs in fits of laughter and in tears laughing) hence he was late as usual(all laugh) then there too Mrs Slate sang a song which was again not complimented by Oscar cause he didn’t hear it was at reservation to attend Cobalion’s marrigae of course(all laugh),yeah,genteleman was the best man for both Mr Oak and Doctor Slate but Mr Oak couldn’t be the best man cause he is on-the-fly generally as he at that moment remembers he has to answer why a man is best only then(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus Doctor Slate himself did the honours there but another is pending(all laugh) here only one can be the best man Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Seth don’t go to Huntelion tomorrow(all laugh) anyway then they said thus our confusion a bit actually that why you will not get the 4th ceremony done the next July itself at latest to mark your 24 years anniversary together(all laugh) I said,well the reason is that the length of the path that is(all laugh) they said,so then(all laugh) I said only that she was my girlfriend once after all that is(all laugh) they were too happy(all
laugh) cause this is Gengar stuff,only one for life(all laugh) all such for all such that is(all laugh,Seth and Mehadi smile at each other) so I said this exactly(all laugh) they were laughing saying may be(all laugh) and then I said well,whole world will have to wait to see the full show that is(all laugh) and the reslut only in the end(all laugh) but back to my Sinnoh break and your illusion what was after I left for Unova the playboy parts that is,they said,well only Gyaradoses would’ve got into the trouble none else cause they would’ve scheduled a show there using not you but Tyranitar(all burst into laughter) surely whole world general government knows that brat to stay safe and sane(all laugh),then they said,anyway,then finally the playboy was playing(all laugh)...I said all beause of lack of dark pigments(all burst into laughter)..this time men were happy(all burst into laughter) said this should be reminded in schools and other gatherings and competitions(all burst into laughter) then I say more so cause natural gentleness is wrongly interpreted(all laugh)..said yeah absolutely agree but that too should be added(all laugh) and also there was the 9-0 McShin trophy(all laugh) then I say but all the 4 stars were made subject to rude behaviour said,yeah the same reason but Gyarados’ are a spesis that people are interest in cause in wild it’s very hard to catch then to gym battle that is very hard indeed I said but in Unova they have Palkia,Kyurem,toss(all laugh),said that’s why Unova Elite4 is poorest(all burst into laughter) then they say yeah afterwards we now realize inside mind all Seth Ketchum but outside had to show Seth Ketchum the jealousy tricks(all laugh) I said,I understand what are the methods(all laugh) said,no nothing a few words to show how comparing in the scale of Mr Seth Ketchum one may be granted which words(all laugh) I said,then the Cerulean reaction to the playboy(all laugh),said,no majority loathed but then all knew that better not invite lunatics(all laugh) and that was cause of those recordings of abstruse philosophical ideas propagated by the likes of Heliolisk(all burst into laughter) who later said this idea of a certain encompasses all cause else how do you encertain that like yourself(all burst into laughter) so these ever helped people so they rather kept a distance that is(all laugh),I said,yeah I’m so lucky to have that bunch that I have being bestowed upon me(all laugh) but what of the Tyranitar reports,said,that was the beginning(all laugh) there were so many Solgaleo,Yveltal,Metagross,Luxray,Snorlax,Crawdauntogator(all laugh),Spiritomb(all laugh),Emboar,Infernape,Bisharp,Donphan,Marshadow and so on(al laugh) GROUDON(all laugh) man that pest came into utmost lunacy and is a world dreaded name anyway so what a sight this pest was against of course Tyranitar especially(All laugh) and this still doesn’t include the thunder-chair merchant starter(all laugh)I said,really fear should drive people away(all laugh) said,no the image in public meant that just playboy who is too heavenly(all laugh) I said only cause they didn’t face one among his bunch(all laugh) said,yeah but a Butterfree took down a Garchomp in Hoenn Elite4(all laugh),I said,no the challenger went back to the master(all laugh) said,yeah that none ever realized(all laugh) I said still why the 2.5 years of madness with shows and gyms(all laugh) said,well all has career goals but very hard to manage,I said,yeah that bit I know but why the situation decreased as the Tyranitar reports increased surely no matter whom were there as family heads,said,no just sentimental heads(all laugh) and gentlemen gentlemen(all burst into laugh,Daisy and Tracey .ly laugh) I said yeah we know family matters surely if misunderstanding is there then things happens but the decision is only in best interest no matter the result but why eavesdrop(all laugh) said yeah the championship and your pigments(all laugh) that’s why at the start everyone should be given a Gastly(all laugh) I said may be then now many of those in hall of fame would’ve been hotel managers(all laugh) said,yeah but things are cleared(all laugh) I said why bother one may be 2 impossible plus the pokemons were good enough just the idea then about a few books may be at most enough said,yeah that’s where Elite4 has to come in cause pokemons are dumb(all laugh) I said,well they only show you the way why turn on them said,no that is there but few wants too much attention and fondling(all laugh) so definitely atleast few lines in the charts(all laugh) I said yeah I agree but anyway,why were Salamances in Kalos scary(all laugh) said,no Dr Oak Dr Oak said just not that type(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)...Dr Oak Dr Oak what are doing/Oh Mr Oak please you soulmate is rueing/Dr Oak Dr Oak you liked her so much just now/but Mr Oak now you don’t tell why and how(all burst into laughter,Lillie .s and laughs)...sister mind this why the ghosts are thus selected(all laugh)…
Lillie(laugh) : “I have enough options to trick him every day and he can’t detect(all laugh)...” Gary(laugh) : “Seth you should be in privacy at this time of day(all burst into laughter)...” Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “in your face you namecalled Gary(all laugh)..you don’t let Seth eat his tiffin..in(all laugh) peace(all laugh)..take that you namecall(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “see it’s so easy if you’re retired(all laugh) Doctor Slate Dr Slate what are you at this time doing(all laugh)/please tell me Doctor Slate why are you now less then more caring(all laugh)/Dr Slate please look at the watch isn’t it time for calling(all laugh)/Doctor Slate you family or wife demands your presence shouldn’t now you be worrying(all burst into laughter)..so Violet sister how about this..”
Violet(laugh) : “just so naive(all burst into laughter)...” Brock(laugh) : “this brat will get me unemployed(all laugh)..Seth I’ll mingle in foods(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “that’s why the tiffin is there(all laugh)...but jackal(all laugh) thus your present for looking after MAR_SHAD_OW(all laugh) cause he along with Dusknoir is going to assist Doctor Slate(all laugh) and will be shifted to other places whom do you wish(all laugh)...” Tracey(laugh) : “just give me few damn poems you brat(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “yeah sure with the preset that Banette and Marshadow will be shifted now the place will be filled up by not Bulbasaur no you’re right serious changing is needed to get those brats setteld(all laugh) Infernape will not be there either and Bulbasaur is relieved after 21 years so you will see some magic(all laugh) as in the case of Infernape the infighting that they do and so on will from now be looked after by Gengleye(all burst into laughter) whole lab is under them now(all laugh) in the gym none but Hawlucha and Talonflame as usual(all laugh),Garchomp already you know has returned and is an encyclopedia reflector now(all laugh) but Riuminas need a personal assistant which will help them to settele them down by Muking(all laugh) along with the fact that where they actually are(all laugh) Banette is being freed up to roam around(all laugh) so please welcome Trace Assistant 1. let us have a vote, on 2,1.Glalie(all burst into laughter and .) and then a special one 2.Greninja(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) so,...”

Gary(laugh) : “but I’m resigning tomorrow(all laugh)...” Seth(laugh) : “wigged is the insinuation Mr Oak why it is called self-reflective-so-subjective- divorce(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs  ary,Gary shakes his head laughing) but for Violet any song isn’t needed to be spoken of(all laugh) cause this last one is her composition(all laugh) for the naivety to move this way(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollably laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) changed to suit(all laugh) plagiarism(all laugh) but then again the new permanent assistant and also for future of Doctor Brock Slate is Duskshadow(all laugh)...so an insignificant trial to see if this serves any purpose...DUSKSHADOW(all laugh)…
Some words are better off forgotten(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) We bury them in places that we really only visit by ourselves Oh you were so caring like no other(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollably laughs) Oh they only tell you what to do before all you see is gone(all uncontrollably laugh,Brock and Violet laugh uncontrollably) What’s the sense in anything when you think what they say is wrong?(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter) Oh what do you want to hear?
Do you want to know how many times I tore myself apart cause you’re not here?(all burst into laughter,Brock puts his hands on his forhead laughing,Violet uncontrollably laughs tears fits of laughter) Oh why do you want to know?
Does it make you feel alive(all burst into laughter) I had to die to finally let you go(all uncontrollably laugh,Brock same pose laughs shaking his head)
Stop me... I find myself believing
A story gets rewritten so a blasphemy’s permitted once again(all uncontrollably laugh) Oh and you were so perfectly imperfect(all uncontrollaby laugh,fits of laughter,tears) Oh why would they tell you what to do when all you have are lies(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter,tears,Brock hides his face with his hands laughing,Violet uncontrollably laughs with tears and fits of laughter)
What’s the sense in anything? It’s just one more goodbye(all uncontrollably laugh,with tears,Brock same pose shaking his head) If you so much want it then just go away Hoopa-read a circle ends on the very way (all burst into

my..projection(all burst into laughter)..I(all laugh) will do whatever I want with my sweet bee(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “so you see this level is needed to get those brats mixed here(all laugh) whose the beaus(all laugh)....,so back to Salamences,so I said look dragons aren’t that bad see the Altaria(all laugh) and Flygon(all burst into laughter) still a Kyogre,a Regirock and then a Cobalion and of all a Gyarados(all laugh) and so on enough to begin and Greninja is good enough as well said,no juts that type(all laugh) then I said well must be hard after Hoenn title said,yeah pretty hard and that was the trouble(all laugh) I said well I was still in too much great terms there(all laugh) said,no you see don’t mind but just if there was even a false ring(all laugh) I said,well you see that might’ve saved me as well as you surely know what happened to me but does it stop the eventual said,no that we agree thus was the trouble as well(all laugh) I said among mutuality I guess(all laugh) said yeah,back to school(all laugh) I said well I never knew that so many may challenge me for getting foisted upon people with whom I only beheaved as a friend cause they were good and travel company you understand no big deal unless imay be in some cases a hall of famer cause you have no life then(all laugh) said,yeah that’s the thing but school only for familiarity(all laugh) that was about a week(all laugh) but the whole phenomena with all was hard(all laugh) I said,yeah I get that but I don’t believe Hoenn was due to influences nor was Pasio the last may be said,yeah Pasio certainly not cause the minds were too scared of Salamences popping up(all laugh) but still got Altaria(all laugh) far well behaved(all laugh) I said,well might’ve been just Altaria vs Pidgeot(all burst into laughter) or even say the same(all laugh) surely my activities were known with Crawdauntogator(all laugh) why choose water,said no we realize that then the HQ roofs were enough(all burst into laughter) I said,exactly my travel would’ve been saved as well cause none would’ve wanted the final(all laugh) said,yeah but even in an office can do(all laugh) ghosts are hard though we only felt water was nice tempred(all laugh) with even fire a few but ghosts and dragons(all laugh) I said well hard indeed but Kanto isn’t easy by any means yeah true that my starter region so I was too lucky to win it but still Melody Sanders won without luck but she herself(all burst into laughter) said,yeah we get that(all laugh) that’s why also Kalos is to be avoided(all laugh) I said may be true certainly would’ve liked to meet at Hoenn again(all laugh) said,yeah that was strange you were favourite at Johto I said,gentleman I guess(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) said,yeah only a bit this from the time of correspondence(all laugh)9 out of 10 reserved for you in illusion never once any praise for any women competitor even then(all burst into laughter) I said no before Kanto you see that’s more interesting cause strange is the press that a trio like Tyranitar,Solgaleo and Yveltal gets playboy tag(all burst into laughter) but still I see the men why ever a confusion to that extent as well schools surely not(all laugh) said,no never cleared Cerulean itself became a world we saw after Hoenn surely we guess this does of hunting heads(all laugh) was necessary I said,yeah well I have time for long chats restart the Hoenn beginning(all laugh) no your name was buzzing(all laugh) but then this idea was there of a phonix(all laugh) but no after a few months at Hoenn hard place and nothing mattered then even after Hoenn not that much but the school(all laugh) I said yeah I saw a few at school(all laugh) and other places too like Melody Sanders and Anabel Hojigela to begin with(all burst into laughter)..still(all burst into laughter) not happy(all laugh) wonder what if I did the right thing by saying ok tag along and Mehu flower in Yellowburst with Melody and gets that news(all laugh) later girlfriend-flower was playing big sister with whole world(all laugh) thus was more compassionate to her than me(all laugh) but now at this moment that mask is no more so again jealousy comes though we’re married for 2 years(all laugh)...23(all laugh) right,and those two for may be 30(all laugh)..well Aabel has been cause the year faced me met her hubby same year 3 years later got married(all laugh) but infact in
that case of Melody being my travel companion,Mehu flower would’ve held traditions out of blue(all laugh) so the two words wouldn’t
have been needed(all laugh) I just imagine my conditions then and after if crook was there(all laugh) that FEELING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Violet in tears laughing,Brock laughs shaking his head) is famillialy just so naive(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs in convulsions of laughter, Brock laughs shaking his head) Melody spoke for 2 hours(all laugh) whole life including personal was known(all laugh) and a few discussions and then asked me about the obvious(all laugh) I told her who Mehu and Brock is Pewter wasn’t visited Cerulean was(all laugh) Daisy was in contact for long was her gym where she first realized her abilities like me in Yellowburst and that had to be Brawn(all laugh) and that’s why Brawn doesn’t want tags(all laugh) creatures(all laugh) Dewgong got Reuniclased(all laugh) then knew the show a bit Marengo being twin cities would’ve(all laugh) and then I say Mehu is sister 4th and hence youngest(all laugh) asks yeah I see but she dancing..(all laugh) that dance Melody ever remembered as you know and before semis we never spoke(all laugh) and that dance was 5 to 7 minutes I don’t think even was 10 cause I would’ve been charged for not discloing my wife’s identity(all laugh) and that too not newly married but for 5 years(all laugh)..,so anyway,I said no Mehu is my best friend(all laugh) and is like that very simple and sweet we are very best friends very good friends(all laugh) that meant I’m booked(all laugh) and after Johto I was aghast that she could go away from me away,away,away(all laugh)....,so then I couldn’t say much cause I thought what if I say I cherish you so much Mehu but why are you going away from me(all laugh) then she would’ve created a mayhem(all laugh) so I thought it’s ok on the way I’ll visit Cerulean but then for 1 month stayed at home each day spoke with her in video(all laugh) for 1 hour(all laugh) at noon at night 2(all laugh) jackal was there one week here one(all laugh) the week jackal was absent was hard(all laugh) if jackal was there she could go out else not(all laugh) thus jackal was here for first 2.5 months then wasn’t for next 2.5 then again next 2 and then again went out for next 3 but by then she was big sister and her big sisters returned(all laugh) but the day Mehu flower said life is such I still recall(all laugh) I was incensed(all laugh) I thought I’ll see how’s your sweet sweet life when I call you Mehadi(all laugh)...,next day called her by full name(all laugh).., and she was so dejected(all laugh) and I also was sure no damn brat was allowed to call her by that nickname means she’s my best friend(all laugh) then I was waiting for 2 words(all laugh) she was here for 1st month was hard 2nd same and from the end of 2nd itself brats were jumping and then Trace was there atleast but then in the middle of 3rd he had to leave and upto 5th brats were around 4th got Gyarados by 6th all were cleard and Trace again was there to help the final cleaning(all laugh) then 8th sisters returned and the brats and else got Daisy’s Dewgong(all laugh) then by 11th when she met me her develoment was almost full(all laugh) then just a matter of experience and Mehu was good enough to be a hall of famer at 27 itself anywhere barring Unova and that was cause she was not from Unova(all laugh) well in reality Mehu really is the universal water empress as you know(all laugh) once only but it’s just that no Gengar(all burst into laughter) that FEELING(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) cause Mehu is too infatuated with me(all laugh) hence no Gengar cause Gengars don’t know what is a feeling that doesn’t tickle(all burst into laughter) well mine doesn’t for sure(all laugh) no really in normal circumstances my Palkia would’ve been here and the rest is that Mehu would’ve beaten anyone in the world but had to tame Palkia by Palkian life(all laugh) to make sure it becomes a circus thus she never had to work again(all laugh) each in Unova gave up there breeding power in the madness but I chided them on this and each said this is before and they said a few Choiced brats disturbing our minds in the gap in between our thought process(all burst into laughter)..and you realize this is straight from single philosophical perfect life if not monastic(all laugh) anyway then I said yeah I saw beauty as well but never became not gender cause the span was minimal as normal to normal max never crossed that and I was 31+ to begin with(all laugh) then they said,yeah but doesn’t it ever prolong no matter the current(all burst into laughter) I said well you see even that can happen only once like we agreed(all laugh) so yeah may be not if monitored and definitely if the want is still there but again I guess you know the time(all laugh) said,yeah that’s true but still 5 years(all laugh) how can things be so true(all laugh) I said well there the right motivation should be there like in your case it was waking up my case was the same but I wasn’t in that unfortunate illusion so I woke up to the fact that may be why bother at all about all these and rather only be with my bunch said yeah that is a possibility with your bunch being so unique it’s enough engaging for one life(all laugh) then I said,but then again,we must go back to build it(all burst into laughter) said,yeah that’s what the women don’t want(all burst into laughter) too nice but starnge is the trust still(all laugh) surely not here but for attentions that should be only on Yveltals(all laugh) I said yeah that I agree but I saw your contacts as well(all burst into laughter) the group was schoolmates(all laugh) said,yeah the idea(all burst into laughter) but surely you know about water pokemon knowledge(all laugh) I said,yeah pretty much but surely just a faint idea cause may be how long till the Solgaleo caught less attention enough to create the trouble may be 18 years I guess(all laugh) said,yeah just that idea somehow 18 and then 4 more(all laugh) 22 years but then out of it takes just one(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah life is strange(all laugh) just the age realted issues(all laugh) said,yeah but 21 years only cause of inconsistency surely Salamences are way worse(all laugh) doesn’t break(all laugh) I said,but Latias and Latios and Palkia even sometimes they are way worse(all laugh) said,no the behaviours of the Latias better but yeah Palkia is impossible meance(all laugh) I said well I guess should’ve been in school there then(all burst into laughter) said,yeah first day same Zipgarnet Lake(all burst into laughter) I said,well I understand but the lake why so much infatuation(all laugh) said,that was trouble to the family(all burst into laughter) but you come across as egotististical(all laugh) which is ever the trouble to family as well(all laugh) we guess it was about the words and gifts(all burst into laughter) I said yeah to look after a gym with those personal situations people become rough(all laugh) only a filter(all laugh,Daisy .ly laughs) and yeah those gifts and words are just the right materials to pass through filter showing the lebel as Daisy not Daisyl(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) but yeah nothings perfect(all laugh) but nothing happened all cause of the gentleman I’m sure you know(all laugh) said,well you surely know your starter lab co directors(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) definitely but ceremony should’ve been together with Mr and Mrs Oak(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah 8 months after Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) but did you help them ever(all burst into laughter) said,yeah told the gentleman nice to know the whole family(all burst into laughter) but he sighed(all uncontrollably laugh,Tracey laughs .ly and Daisy uncontrollably laughs in fits of laughter as well) and yeah the other way as well just that look(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs and in tears laughing,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs as well) and Mr Oak was never happy with our activities(all laugh) as Mr Oak we know and the starter lab rules(all laugh) very strange that all there and all here and then the first gym leader as well(all laugh) but has a link somehow a real novel(all burst into laughter and .) I said I guess previous lives you may believe in(all laugh) said,yeah otherwise 21 years and then just 1 can’t be really validated(all laugh) and this means not to worry at all(all laugh) but hard with life(all laugh) I said,yeah that’s what’s spoken all over the place but still there are singles and then far ahead are monks(all laugh) they are happy far more than we’ll be living life only for others and purely said,yeah somehow next phases we guess when the other is rather as if two in one so no outside(all laugh) I said,yeah I absoulutely agree and both way as nuns as well(all laugh) so similarity applies if all there but surely then isn’t it(all laugh) said,yeah we agree with the whole picture(all laugh) but this to the random challengers(all burst into laughter) and then every year 96 new champs everywhere so so few in hall of fame and even multiple champions and dragonsare there too we guess(all laugh) if not Salamence,Palkia for sure(all laugh) surely life is strange(all laugh) I said,yeah I concur wholeheartedly but to win leagues Palkia was defeted innumerable times(all laugh) said,yeah defeating is one but if that meance is in the living room then different game(all laugh) I said,yeah surely but Mr Oak was intelligent by moments as Mr Oak is wasn’t he(all laugh) said,yeah the gentleman then married of course 8 months later(all laugh) when we last met said a great thing persistence per precise perceptions(all burst into laughter) same thing we guess(all laugh) I said,yeah helped you too evenly all times despite the environmental concerns then and his own ideas of the situation that’s why the perfect gentleman(all burst into laughter,Tracey .ly laughs) said,yeah surely did but our perceptions were wrong(all laugh) I said yeah but one must realize the goal said,yeah we what we did was that what we heard form Doctor Brock Slate(all laugh) and did that with the illusion both times really(all laugh) but we guess you can spend the whole day here(all burst into laughter) I said yeah pretty much looking at the whole weather too happy why so much adoration(all laugh) said,no that’s the contradictory part(all laugh) these people most here thinks of you as Young Ketchum dream(all uncontrollably laugh,.) only the press meetings have made sure they understand the wrong contradiction and thus don’t disturb your peace though we know you’re not at all polite yourself(all laugh) if that is actually still disturbed(all laugh) but anyway, so that you’re a sought after name along with your bunch cause their endeavours are baffling(all laugh) so you being the master need to control them(all laugh) and thus when the right contradiction is pointed to people come up with isuues like we ourselves are doing(all burst into laughter) but that’s the point cause then we only have warmth and respect and yet the wrong contradiction makes sure that we understand that the respect is of ever similar level that somehow you’re this great man who knows many unbelieveable things and only if properly approached will say but even there in talks and all we’re sorry for the language but you surely will understand so we’re not explainging so excuse for the language again but Seth Ketchum no matter what titles deeds or allegations is in core more like a Gengar(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) which if the general dictionary is used then means frivolus(all laugh) but that’s exactly another contradiction to keep even outside profession people at total bay(all laugh) so this can’t be a plan we guss(all laugh) I said well yeah life is strange(all laugh) but can a person at 37 be called young(all burst into laughter) said,no the cosmetics feed ideas mutually(all uncontrollably laugh) I said,yeah the other way around is hard to know else own experience dictates so(all burst into laughter) said,yeah infact you loved ponytails as well as we were indicated(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah just that idea(all laugh) but why would someone go upto that point(all laugh) said,yeah you see only self harming cause the flight tickets are to us rather not costly neither the experience there(all laugh) so we were helped rather as was each there no matter how hurt and you’re here cause things really are suiting the name(all laugh) I said yeah I was contacted by Lance himself cause she is like his daughter of that age and is extremely skillfull one of a kind so I was asked if I could help I said yeah let’s see what appeases the moods(all laugh) but still we’ve been stuck at the quote(all laugh) what of the times(all laugh) said,well the previous day was a bit emotional(all laugh) cause we thought of getting into the 11 city circle administration jobs which are innumerable in numbers(all laugh) and etc but needed to understand issues you see, I said yeah the age was right(all burst into laughter) said ,yeah so thought of clearing things up and went there the family knew the issues(all laugh) at that time Mr Oak had married so was no more not liking us by abstaining as you understand(all laugh) and the head was desperate by then cause the gentleman was unnecessarily pesisting too much with the mask(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy uncontrollably laughs) but we guess you are interested in the Kanto beginning more(all laugh) I said yeah definitely said,well that time the main leader was nowhere in her head(all laugh) so she was not behaving properly as to suddenly become too emotional(all laugh) the whole world knew a Mr Seth Ketchum was the reson(all laugh) the trouble was he was roaming around with a certain Tyranitar(all laugh) so the replacement were being searched for(all burst into laughter) for the exact contradiction that you represent(all laugh) that baffled even Brock(all laugh) so then you see a few good friends were there(all laugh) and thus the idea(all laugh) no none in the surroundings understood one bit of this contradiction(all laugh) cause all were taught professionality(all laugh) exactly what they never liked(all laugh) cause they couldn’t approach you at all(all laugh) you said like yeah this is what it is about you and herbut see if a Tyranitar faces a Kyogre(all burst into laughter) which meant ego but they didn’t know that was the exact truth of reality of what none knows about a Tyranitar for their safe passage(all laugh) so anyway thus we came to know and was curious cause the whole world by then knew Tyranitar(all laugh) if not a Solgaleo who was named as Madgaleo(all laugh) cause he when was tried to be tested jumped upon the poor doctors but fondling them(all laugh) yet the machines read he was saying he wants to feed on their each beaus together(all burst into laughter) and still there was time for a Yveltal who did the similar thing but said to the people are you girlfriend’s Choiced beaus(all uncontrollably laugh) and Tyranitar went the furthest saying who’se who’se illegal beau(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) bring their beaus too some Choiced brats sneaked away behind the hallucinations yesterday(all burst into laughter) this meant the battle was mental cause the hallucinations were self created(all laugh) thus they won’t harm so no termination but only they would never have
been terminated at all the whole lab would’ve(All laugh) for each thus atleast 80 labs would’ve been no more with people and pokemons inside(all laugh) then in a dragonic water gym Heracross was used(all laugh) who tossed away a Palkia out of the battlefield as soon as she could grab him(all laugh) and the leader wanted to quit the gym(all laugh) was fed a Donphan(all burst into laughter) who directly attcaked the leader by rolling and jumping to the opposite platform to create a quake that was enough to shake the water up for Gyarados of all pokemons to get scared beyond death(all laugh) and then when Gyarados was up a canonball stuck him(all laugh) which meant Donphan made his way back to you with Gyarados(all laugh) the leader said I’ve got grandkids(all burst into laughter) to which you cried that she was trying to take away your livelyhood(all burst into laughter) so a poor Kyurem had to be the chosen one(all laugh) who was given a Pidgeot(all burst into laughter) not one ice beam worked and so on cause the bird each time the beam was there from underwater expected it’s spot and diverted(all laugh) Kyurem had to come up when the bird created a gust that took the water away may be(all laugh) the so Kyurem had to charge which meant the gust threw him out of the gym(all laugh) if the bird’s body charge wasn’t enough while he was supposed to be in halluciantion(all laugh) the leader gave the badge and may be hasn’t been found again(all laugh) this was the last gym before the Unova finals but not the last at the region cause that one was the day before the final match on that very day(all laugh) the final was shifted for the public cause no match took more than 4 hours(all laugh) and this was the best water type in Unova and Kalos combined as the name suggested and when these 3 were checked they said all substandard food not the girlfriend(all burst into laughter) this meant they were eternally waiting for the elusive sinister(all laugh) and thus was getting frustrated(all laugh) and this was the only way to tame them down so they realized that the master uses girlfriends to tackle the bunch(all laugh) which cemented the playboy image cause to them wisdom dawned that only one girlfriend isn’t suitable then(all burst into laughter) and the master posed in tea shirts(all laugh) like the whole world we thought your bunch should be killed immediately(all laugh) which was defended against by many gym leaders there in Unova itself who said then we’ll quit too(all laugh) else our bunch will kill us cause they tried to recruit them endmatch(all burst into laughter) and we’re so happy that you didn’t care about the rest of Cerulean else all those lunatics would’ve been roaming around freely at night to check each door if the chosen girlfriend was there to be hunted down(all laugh) so we were granted our lives(all laugh) and that Solgaleo was the one which the master himself in press so jovially said that just his little Solgy(all burst into laughter) so that was enough for the world to know that this is something else(all laugh) and we realize if anyone says terminate the bunch within next 6 another set will be created(all laugh) thus all pokemons have to be terminated means all of us will be begging from door to door next year(all laugh) while you will rule over us still according to obvious logic(all laugh) and then all knew who imagined about such absurd translators(all laugh) and so on the philosophical ideas and so on yeah people can say many things even try to be Gengar but expecting a Gengar will return more enlightening facts on the same is just Gengar(all burst into laughter)that none sane would try to do(all laugh) so we realized along with whole world it’s about keeping safe distance away from Gengars(all laugh) and if they enter your room pray just that they let you be sad(all laugh)and then the Cerulean leader there was nowhere found(all laugh) so to find the leader out(all laugh) people were curious like her own family(all laugh) then we went there and the Zipgarnet Lake was poured uponus(all laugh) then we were curious as you returned by then all this water gym story was world famous(all laugh) and we knew the gym leader was lost totally in bushes(all laugh) as may be were you(all laugh) so nothing worked then the undercover came around and none in the world knew where you were so then we thought that you’re not returning(all laugh) so we in illusion went to Kanto(all laugh) to try to win the league as normal workmen do(all laugh) and thought may be you will be forgotten as part of the infatuation(all laugh) but infact you were under the cover the actual place for your bunch cause that meant Team Rocket will themselves run up the cover and surrender(all laugh) and a Crawdaunt and Feraligator did it but jovially(all laugh) cause as we said that we heard Feraligator was told to surpass the despondency of being so(all burst into laughter) and Crawdaunt was told to pierce through the Crawdaunt that’s not so(all burst into laughter) hence they made the rocket boss turn on his HUMAN condition(all laugh) which proved that you can do anything you want as you just befriended Team Rocket to happily surrender(all laugh) and that’s Gengar(all laugh) but after coming up to the cover you mouthed the whole world off saying everyone was after your bunch(all laugh) so they had to stay alive themselves(all laugh) and thus didn’t do anything which was great cause we thought you may release your bunch in wild which by now would’ve long forced all out of this profession(all laugh)anyway,then we won the Kanto unfortunately the final round was against a Solgaleo managed by 5 time champ(all laugh) in her last to even break her dreams of progessing(all laugh) and so we were so confident that by now you were send off to mars(all laugh) cause none sane would want a playboy whose bunch is mad after girlfriends(all burst into laughter) so we returned happily with the trophy and then by this time the leader was showing signs of moving on by getting the you quota down to 7 from 9 out of 10(all laugh) so we had a few chats which proved that you were nicest but not so so(all laugh) anyway so later we were familier in the meantime a few other men were there who each got 2 dates each to discuss about you(all laugh) each time only to have their manhoods questioned and thus was off before getting readied to go out of the house even(all laugh) so we were left as the poor samples(all laugh) and by now you stared to do what you did with us with your Tauros(all laugh) so we thought definitely the playboy is dangerous(all laugh) and then we had chats and all and in the meantime the gentleman finally got married(all laugh) so now none of the sisters were there and we met Brock after saving ourselves from Salamences(all laugh) and then we were further taken to the friendship and all and then he opined that we were the poor samples indeed(all laugh) thus that quote and we after all marriages of all others tried our hands at removing the .sin mask(all laugh) before this we asked for dates twice but was politely called off as we were nothing to you(all laugh) besides to tell you none of us or other men ever were approached at all or asked for dates though we were told your case was exactly the opposite(all laugh) so by the way the second time we were compared to you was not received well by the head(all laugh) so we were invited to the gym(all laugh) and then we’re sure you have had innumerable sketchs of yourself(all laugh) I said,’yeah I’ve had my days under the sky(all laugh) go on long discourses are what I prefer for the purpose of fun of being Gengar(all laugh) I’m sure you are yourselves realizing why Gengar is a funny creature(all laugh) said,yeah most certainly and this our women can’t take sadly too fond(all burst into laughter) I said,only cause it I guess may be just about a couple of months ago the confessions were(all burst into laughter) said,no about one(all burst into laughter) they know everything yet are afraid to know all so that they are clarified more(all laugh) I said,don’t bother post marriages you will have ample time and no for this marriages aren’t harmed unless before two months post the lunar phase(all laugh) said,no we agree but you see the 1 years is so great(all laugh) that the previous is seeming so funny yeah life is strange(all burst into laughter) I said yeah all related to age(all burst into laughter) said,yeah anyway so we asked for a sketch as by then we were forced to get arranged(all laugh) but the sketches don’t come while the gentleman comes out with flying colours(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs and Tracey laughs shaking his head) so now as we get the full picture we’re saying but before that to clarify the before realization parts to us it was that you had overgrown this world of our profession and may be thus had gone to mars and the trouble was that you could’nt except mentally so we thought of no hope for you(all laugh) and well about the match you know well why we went there but we thought the public humiliation and all plots may get you insecured and all and the talks were to make you so but we got the same re[peated lines so no progess could be made(alllaugh) and our bunch told us that your Tauros has no connection to you what so ever(all laugh) and you could talk with our Kyogre better than us despite Tauros(all laugh) we realized that whole world has become a psychic game to you(all laugh) so may be Mexutus is herds may not be even given a pokemon to begin with for you to tame them(all laugh) cause you yourself are a 50 times bigger herd of Gengars(all laughs) and the trouble for all is that even if they try and so on in battles and all a 16 year old goes out to journey what’s his goal I want to be a Gengar(all burst into laughter) so that is something that you can’t have any feelings about exactly as would be a Gengar(all laugh) so this life of Gengar is truly amusing there are other ghosts even Sableye(all laugh) we ourselves have one(all burst into laughter) but still he and they have some reservations and all even Haunter does and Gengars as well(all laugh) but the full Gengar(all burst into laughter) that is a being who roams around not knowing anything at all(all laugh) and yes the important thing another is that from the gym leader on your performances not much was opined but it was said that your Glalie mind the tense is so cute(all burst into laughter) and your Kalos final victory was sweet(all laugh) then we played the sentimental card(all burst into laughter) cause we knew that before next millennia none is doing that final again(all laugh) cause afterwards Gengar said this urge to know is cause the definition of knowing not being as clear to them as much as is tickling isn’t it(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) and then just the thought(all laugh) but later confirmed cause later the Noivern was tested cause others 73 did the same but never the pokemons were in such plight(all laugh) and Gengar was cause first Sabrina is one of the greatest names of all times even may be and now for sure and she said gravely that, that Gengar scared his own mom a bit who is legendary herself(all laugh) she said this is a record of frivolity(all laugh) and second said that Gengar made even a person like her think twice about why afterlives should be properly directed cause this brat got a wrong body and hence has become extremely jovial cause now he can directly fool around without any limits(all laugh) and most heinously show others(all laugh) third the Gastly became Haunter in the earliset possible time which is a record by an unthinkable margin to begin with(all laugh) and said he evolved cause his mom told him do you know what is agitative reverse tickling(all burst into laughter) he said hence I evolved cause I said look kid(all burst into laughter) your idea of agitative reverse is to give the most obvious way of representing two negetives so you get only tickling thus you get no progress in tickling so your tickling becomes stale hence you’re caught in a bondage of specification of evolution(all laugh) then he evolved himself saying you agitated me by saying two negetives so I reversed it to two positives that is agitative tickling of reversal(all burst into laughter) that is against your negative-negetive- positive now is negative-neutral-dubious hence could be anything(all laugh) and thus this iead of reversal vs reverse is why evolution is no good neither is life cause they are rather frivolous and yet not self established(all burst into laughter) in tickling that is(all uncontrollbaly laugh) cause reverse is an action that you produce or may be spontaneous like tickling of course(all burst into laughter) but reversal is the holistic view when you know reversing is as well inbuilt thus if you know that none tickles none that is if I tickle you and I don’t know me or you then only tickling is left ain’t it(all burst into laughter) this idea that I tickle or get tickled is the most dreadfull hindrence to that type of tickling(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) and then Sabrina said this pest stayed on as a Haunter cause to him he won’t evolve more unless he gets that feeling(all laugh) and most dreadfully during the only breeding season that this meance was there,he scoffed at everyone saying this tickling is the confinement of the full tickling cause you depend on others to tickle you despite knowing they expect the same from you thus an idea of duty,you see kids no good is this responsible tickling(all burst into laughter) cause when I was Gastly different kids came to me I tickled them they did the same we went to competitions and so on but all are an hindrence to that greatest tickling isn’t this cause you’re responsible for yourself or your partner to tickle more where’s more or less in tickling(all burst into laughter) hence why bother about them at all(all laugh) hearing this heinous philosophy and impending doom for sanity(all laugh),his mom ever told me this meance isn’t happy at all cause he can’t unleash which is better not to be discussed(all laugh) get my master in he gives this freedom why I myself have unleashed upto this(all laugh) but this pest wants that perfect tickling(all laugh) so he will get extremely agitated and try to drag you to certain planes to compell you to invent ideas of tickling which he reviews(all burst into laughter) none will suit him and all of us including you will go mad(all laugh) else this pest will get more philosophical and drag everyone with him to become totally mad(all laugh) then you went there and asked this pest what is the difference between being and becoming vs knowing and understanding(all burst into laughter) the answer then wasn’t given may we know(all laugh),I said,yeah sure later he evolved into Gengar and said being and becoming are contradictory to each other while being necessary and the second is just the same and then the two cross each other out hence the establishment of life I was trying to find is in the fullest possible tickling of self out of everything else hence I became a Gengar to tickle this idea of tickling to renovate it in essence(all burst into laughter) they said,yeah we see why professionally crooked gentlemen are indespensible to your bunch(all laugh),I said yeah,you see among them the first one says this idea of existence is so intricately ingrained in this feeling of the same(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) and his soulmate says,this idea of expression of being is so maddening that this makes you surpass the barrier of space and time(all burst into laughter,Violet in tears laughing) then the 2nd step says this idea of perfection is so intriguing that you run after that automatically growing in it getting established to present a being that gets most perfect by each surpassing days of each year(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy in tears laughing) hence will ushurp your whole being with all the days to make sure you’re only the one in all the days(all burst into laughter) and his soulmate says,this idea of appearance and reality that is seen and then deciphered or the attempt is there to do the same is ingrained in the fact that you want more and only settle for the most perfection which will appears as a jackal to make the appearance to get the reality most enjoying(all burst into laughter,Daisy in fits and tears of laughter,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs) then there’s the obvious last step(all laugh) what should be order sis(all laugh)..” Lillie(laugh) : “yeah the reverse wigging that’s the unfoldment of the wig represents what is the most engaging(all burst into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “on-the-fly yeah(all burst into laughter)” Gary(laugh) : “man this pest would’ve ruined my moments(all laugh)” Lillie(laugh) : “AH!THAT INNOCENT SMILE OF GEETING CAUGHT THAT BLUSH!SO ENDEARING(all burst into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “Mr Oak why is called that type of blush(all brust into laughter)” Gary(laugh) : “yeah,your Gyarados including herself didn’t even spare you that time either(all brust into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh,Seth and Mehadi smiles at each other)..anyway,so yeah this is the same,actually(all laugh) the next wigged step says,this idea of being is wigging the self hence only wait letting all wigs flow by you being self established as much as possible till that type of baldening wig is found(all brust into laughter,Lillie in tears laughing,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus your being and self will mix together to produce the real wig of reality that’s what Crawdauntogator asserts in joviality(all burst into laughter) then the final step of course is so sweetening(all laugh)..that is best decribed actually from my bunch’s point of view(all laugh) they with that say(all laugh)..
Wake up to that maddening tune(all laugh)! the song that had its birth Far off, where the taint of being could never reach(all laugh) In mountain caves and glades of forest deep(all laugh) Where we got confined to this being(all laugh) only to be released have we come as knew this before we were born(all laugh) that we will sing high that note,
Mr Oak OH MR OAK!(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably in tears of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Strike off the self fetters that bind thee down to sanity(all laugh) Of all that’s the duality’s song(all laugh) Hence turn on your being to be free(all laugh) and tell Mr Oak that Mr Oak despite our master we’ll be here after lifelong(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)”Let despondency of that type go(all burst into laughter) the will-o’-the-wisp that leads
With blinking light to pile more gloom of being or just that self maddening tune.(all burst into laughter)
This thirst for being,for ever quench ; this dragging From birth to death, and death to birth, the soul.(all laugh) He counters all who counters the self by the self(all laugh) Know this And never let us yield(all burst into laughter) Cause you can’t help it till you go insane(all laugh) and then let the whole existence say, Mr Oak OH where’s thou now why is it called MR OAK(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laugh) After this life again may be
we’ll come to repeat this when you decide you’ll be(all burst into laughter) see I can’t let you off either cause you are me(all burst into laughter) thus Mr Oak in any birth first say whose Gary this is Mr Oak can’t you see(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollaly laughs in tears of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..
this is one more a toast for the epitome of the Oak Labs(all laugh) There ain’t no grave can hold my body down(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) There ain’t no grave can hold my body down When I hear that maddening sound I’m gonna rise right out of the ground(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) Ain’t no grave can hold my body down(all laugh) Well,look way down the future(all laugh) what do you think I see?(all laugh)?
I see a band of angels(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) but they’re coming after me(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) Ain’t no being can hold my self down(all laugh) Mr Oak There ain’t no being that Mr Oak can hold our insanity down(all laugh) Well, look down no more yonder Giraora(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) put your feet on this lab and see(all laugh) And Darkramar please you blow your trumpet as Mr Oak my name you heard it from me(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) There ain’t no being Mr Oak can hold Mr Oak down(all laugh) Ain’t no being can hold our future from getting spoiled down(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) Well, meet me Rayquaza(all laugh), meet me Dragonite Meet me in the middle of the air Latios(all burst into laughter) And as these beings fail me(all burst into laughter) I will meet you anywhere sorry nowhere(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) Ain’t no grave can’t hold Gary down(all laugh) But There ain’t no grave can hold Mr Oak down(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) Well, meet us uncle and aunty, meet us down the Unova-Kalos border road(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing,Gary shakes his head laughing) And aunty you know that I’ll be there after WE check out of Karapaskar-Huntelion mode(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing) But unlike uncles Ain’t no being can hold our school suspended Kommo-O down(all burst into laughter) And There ain’t no being can hold us from going to Venturiastrog down(all laugh) And call at this time cause There ain’t no other time that can hold my parents naivety down(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing)...So later then I guess,bye(all laugh and reciprocate and bye)...”
......................................
(2 days later,night,middle)
Seth(laugh) : “yeah,so then beautiful men continues,anyway,so unfortunately both Gengar and Noivern was thought of as good sample to test(all laugh)unfortunate for the researchers that is(all laugh) as the dragonic sample said this confinement that I’ve been forced to makes me to think about the thoughts that are coming to me through ages whenever I’ve felt such a thought in the thoughts of the thought that what is a confinement at all(all burst into laughter) what is this idea of thought of a confinement that confines the thoughts of the thought of own thoughts on own thoughts to add to the basic thought of what is a thought to begin with who we are how we know hey are you thinking on your thoughts(all burst into laughter) humans fled the scene what to speak of pokemons cause they understood a dark dragon with that power of thoughts can send them to various thoughts from which there’s no return cause there only can but will they know the real tickling(all burst into laughter) and this dragon and the Gengar were brought there by the gentleman(all burst into laughter) who said solemnly to leave these meances to thoughts of tickling(all laugh) only upon his master’s thoughtfull antics(all laugh) who said then just my Nivy(all laugh) and Gengy(all burst into laughter) as he said just my Ultracozy(all burst into laughter) Cozy said so many specifications this moment then no more the signals so dense(all laugh) truly it would please me why is it so being HUMAN(all brust into laughter) humans fled immediately cause Ultracozy was none other than the Pseudo-legendary dark-ghost-psychic- dragon named Ultranercozma(all laugh) if that name and type strenghts weren’t ultra enough this meance was straight out of Team Rocket’s very own cozy den(all laugh) so she knows many things about human-pokemon interactions that better be not discussed exactly why she is desperate to show them to HUMANS(all laugh) and yeah human was there of course(all laugh) who solemnly pointed out he has had to use every unimaginable medicines possible each day after work cause the humanization has happened only at his cost(all laugh) and later we’ve all been informed about the lack of concentration on the differetiation of the thoughts on bro and beau thoughts(all burst into laughter) that really helped us to laugh all off(all laugh) and same as our soulmates thus infact it helps(all laugh) but anyway,so if you were out of millennia(all laugh) and that was the trouble to begin with then we thought as we said to decide(all laugh) and all else were by then off so we were left thus we were burgaining(all laugh) I said,well about thoughts(all laugh) it’s what my Noivern does as he is born like that and I just communicate for them(all burst into laughter) and Gengar too for sure(all laugh) but do you know about hall of famers and so on when you were there and an issue whith the Frucifern gym there cause I heard a few were naive(all laugh) said,no as far as we were concerned till the time none except us and the other few that we spoke of cause the skill level simply cause now as good as hall of fame in our profession if not just a 6+ times champ but we never thought anything less than a 5 time champ then cause wasn’t in hall of fame yet and with the personal troubles but that rather helped to accelerate we guess cause the battling was relief with Glalie’s memories(all burst into laughter,.) how is your assesment? I said,first I have a question that what if the whole pokemon world each professional becomes a Gengar(all burst into laughter) surely first whole world will try to join in and if fails cause it’s not easy(all laugh) then still the money will flow into each home in oceans won’t it(all laugh) said,yeah sure that’s the kids are aiming at now starting with a Duskull(all burst into laughter) and hence the number will get lessened and yeah the money for sure(all laugh),I said,yeah I thought so as well(all laugh) and about assesment of this gym leader well if with me would’ve won Johto and me Pasio and then Hoenn would’ve been a toss so we would’ve parted if we wanted that goal most and she would’ve been in Frontier then Hoenn then Sinnoh then Kalos then Unova and would’ve won if only this order she followed not anything else(all laugh) and I would’ve been at Hoenn,Sinnoh,Frontier,Unova,Kalos which would’ve fetched the same result for me then in Elite4 we would’ve been in different months so my result barring Lance would’ve been same as you know Lance is a man that I respect too much for my bunch’s liking(all laugh) and thus the Kanto Elite4 match has been played out like that on Lance’sinsistance(all laugh) and she would’ve got 5-2 would’ve won against Percy but not Ivana cause Ivana is too intuitive and Lance no I don’t see that one Percy was in that mood got Lance 5th won,David I know from undercover is as good as anyone and certainly thus bettered Lance that day but still it’s rather a fluke and the other person to have ever beaten Lance in these 15 years is just Marc the Mr Litman(all laugh) and for David was 4-6 not 2-8 so yeah the gym leader is a 6,5 Hall of Fame definitely and without me(all laugh)..well(all burst into laughter),if my path was followed would’ve only got the Hoenn interesting but the rest two next I don’t see and the last two isn’t proper(all laugh) but at Hoenn might’ve been a draw or she would’ve won then I would’nt have been hall of fame at all totally different career but my bunch would’ve still become thus just after Hoenn itself(all laugh) and then it’s a matter of safety(all laugh) cause the number of pokemons with me would’ve been all the highest evoluted pokemons of all types(all laugh) then the hall of fame would’ve told me to quit the porfession cause fisrt I would’ve had enough to create a Oak lab in double size than the current(all laugh) and then my full bunch would’ve made any authority or tags or class totally meaningless(all laugh) but then for her a 7-0,6-1 definitely but only if she didn’t make the mistake of going to Unova before Kalos as only in the last two the 7th and 8th must’ve been Kalos and Unova reverse order Unova won’t be won,Kalos toss with 60% negetive bias at normal finish time if prolonged no chance(all laugh) and yeah if Sinnoh after Hoenn in any cases other than first 4 with me as number 5th and not 6th after Hoenn at 4th and was the 3rd title would’ve abjectly lost(all laugh) but if I never existed then it would’ve been(all laugh)..yeah,this one is ok cause this is theory(All laugh)..so if that case then Kanto,Pasio,Johto must’ve been followed if Johto before Pasio would’ve lost both unless Hoenn was tried before Pasio to get Pasio(all laugh) but still Kalos and Unova 7th and 8th must(all laugh) so lets say the two possibilities Kanto,Pasio,Johto,Hoenn,Frontier,Sinnoh,Kalos,Marriage(all laugh)..ok,ok(all laugh),no really you know Trace and Brock certainly had to themselves get their soulmates to look at them themselves after quarrel(all laugh) Dr Oak Dr Oak neutral(all laugh) Dave and Zara too neutral same sort of ways and the shrew was the Drew kind(all laugh) but I was first day totally gobbled up(all laugh)..so my Gyaradosy flower was totally mad for my preparation even(all laugh) and since then just Seth and that’s it(all laugh) by-the-way before Brawn’s den(all laugh) I tried my hands unknowingly at the jealousy trick(all burst into laughter)..at the cost of Dicey(all burst into laughter,Mehadi laughs a lot in silence)..man still says you endangered my life(all laugh)..so Candice


was there and all and had a one on one there was there for Bulbasaur and Squirtle who injured each other too much the day we got Squirtle(all laugh) and then
I just afterwards said yeah nice girl good match no matter my dragons they are harmless all knows ask Doctor Slate for it he's around us always(all laugh a lot,..THAT FEELING,Brock shakes..lot) so I had time and nice to meet her much like Yumi(all laugh) HOW DARE YOU COMPARE THAT NAMCALL TO Yumn(all burst into laughter,Mehadi laughs a lot in silence)..EVEN I’M WAY BETTER THAN HER AT WATER TYPES(all laugh)..nice girl..nice(all laugh)..I’LL NEVER BE NICE TO YOU UNLESS YOU REPAY..um..no..(all burst into laughter)..NEVER EVEN IF YOU REPAY(all laugh)..huh..nice girl..THAT NAMECALL HAS DELUGED HERSELF IN MENTAL COSMETICS YOU IDIOT(all burst into laughter,Goran cheers for Baby Gyarados,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in silence  oy,Seth laughs a lot  er) by then I just enjoyed my sweet Gyarados so much cause had the intuitive idea that it’s just my wife at teenage(all laugh) which is something that i learnt as familially i saw the end of it oh so demure(all burst..,Poppy scowls..,Goran laughs..lot)
Poppy(scowl) : "shut up you namecall!atleast we represented algebraic modelling unlike your statistical inferring(all un..,..THE CLINICAL ONES)"
Seth(laughing..) : "yeah atleast before marriage we stayed distant apart longer(all burst..),anyway so then I said Mehadi why are you so upset that I don’t allow you to waste your time with PHYSICAL cosmetics(all laugh a lot) cause we’re on the road it wastes our time that’s all(all laugh) and no she didn’t use one fingertip of cosmetics psychophysical(all laugh a lot,Mehadi laughs a lot  oy in silence),um..no..you..um..(all laugh)..why don’t you like me Seth(All burst into laughter) I by then more than realized what she was saying of course to her hubby(all laugh) so I said cause we’re friends and also travel companions hence we don’t need to be formal do we Mehadi hum(all laugh)..that’s the substitute for the obvious words(all laugh),so becomes too happy and straightaway hugs me death for no reason(all laugh)..then says,um..Seth..will Yumi join you after her studies(all burst into laughter,Mehadi laughs a lot in silence),I said just one word(all laugh a lot),’us(all burst into laughter,Mehadi laughs a lot  oy in silence,all cheers for PLAYBOY CONFINED,all laugh even more)..’,so she became too happy and just kept  e saying nothing(all laugh) and I was just enjoying my wife’s company so much in abstraction forgot her entirely mechanically patting her(all laugh)..and as you know none of us wanted to get out of that shell cause we weren’t bothered about words at all even in dreams(all laugh) but that dumb crook(all laugh)..crook was silently observing it as it was private(all laugh a lot) but thankfully didn’t know how to sketchIT down(all laugh) but he’s way worse in a way cause the jackal atleast didn’t directly intrude during the moments ALL THE TIME(all laugh a lot) and even if he had to cause he had too much in his head to memorize the scene(all laugh) he would just ask something related to pokemons or so or sometimes directly say like man why don’t you two get married(all laugh) never insinuated atleast(all laugh) exactly as any personal butler would professionally(all laugh a lot,Tracey shakes his head laughing) but that two faced crook(all laugh),now first allows both to FEEL the joy(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) then exactly as he feels that this much is enough for our mental and especially physical age(all burst into laughter,Brock and Violet uncontrollably laughs),says,all are hurt Seth if the heart is hurt/but girls are more smart Seth cause the consolation they’re quick to convert(all burst into laughter,Brock uncontrollably laughs) I thought yeah certainly not if holding a cup half of tea(all burst into laughter,Brock and Violet uncontrollably laugh) anyway,so the crook cooks our moment as usual and this enrages Mehu flower so much that she screeches SHUT UP YOU NAMECALL!(ALL LAUGH) YOU NAMECALL,YOU ALWAYS TRY TO RUIN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH Seth(all laugh)..I’M NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYONE IF Seth..um..he(all laugh)..JUST GET OUT(all laugh).. so the crook goes away silently laughing(all laugh)..no you see Violet not for nothing I torment your hubby brat(all laugh) this brat always ruined my moments during Kanto hence at Johto was banished(all laugh)..man that’s some saga indeed isn’t it Brock managing your baby Gyarados all alone(all laugh,Brock says,profusely,all laugh even more,Mehadi laughs a lot),anyway then I said Mehadi why do you unnecessarily think these things you’re my friend and we’ll be traveling for next 2 years at least stop these(all laugh),um yeah,it’s just that um..(all laugh)..friends..but..only..um..(all laugh) then I said we’ll become
best friends as we travel along together(all laugh),again crook pops up,he means if you can continue or keep being inferior to him not even equal what to speak of better mentally though(all burst into laughter,Brock uncontrollably laughs),YOU NAMECALL SHUT THE NAMECALL UP!(all laugh) I’ll always travel with Seth..um..(all laugh)..I’LL ALWAYS TRAVEL WITH HIM IN THIS REGIOANL JOURNEY ATLEAST UNLIKE YOU(all laugh) then she walked off too miffed,so I didn’t like this at all you see(all laugh) thus Brock do you remember anything(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah most certainly(all laugh)..I was threatened by my flower to keep an eye on her baby brat who turned out to be a not not male to her brat’s brats(all laugh)..so I was trying to gauge HOW MUCH IS THE BONHOMIE(all laugh)..so anyway then wife was too disappointed thinking that to me she’s just another for my baby bro(all laugh),which pro now takes over being incensed with my behaviour to my little sis cause she’s his wife first(all laugh)..so now starts,no you’re right Brock too egotistical you know thinks of herself to be whose who(all laugh)..didn’t end that thankfully(all laugh)..now says,which reminds me of a rhyme that who rhymes with Pyukumuku Brock(all laugh) protestation of proverbial proclamation of prejudiced practices of prognosis of perfect pretension(all brust into laughter) rhymes with Flygon Brock fruition of fallible fastening of festive formations of facial ferocity(all brust intpo laughter) rhyming with futility Brock can you assemble these two to create a Pamkaboo Brock prehistoric progression of permeative prelude to pervasively portable precaution(all burst into laughter) rhymes with Meltan Brock your specialty missing memories of miscellaneous morphisms of monotonic mentions of mistakes(all burst into laughter) rhyming with handshakes Brock this Meltan if you can derive from the Pyukumuku then what you get rhymes with Raticate rhythmic rings of rotational recalling of restive rises of rashes(all burst into laughter) if you think I’m wrong Brock just ask any Sawk if they know what means so is only to tell that the consequence thus becomes so rhyming with Honchkrow Brock whose that pokemon Brock who please tell me how to become that asks my Goodu(all brust into laughter)..so I realized this is a clear threat to not cross his wife(all laugh) else will throw me into that horrendous cauldron as well as if I didn’t know the PHYSICAL identity of Goodu who went against poor Dicey’s Croconaw though(all laugh) and just like claaped him to draw(all laugh a lot),so I said man just beat it I know you want to travel with her so much as well(all laugh),cause her chosen types rhymes with Huntail Brock when she told me first my name is Mehadi I instantly recalled it rhymes with hasty(all laugh a lot,Mehadi laughs a lot  oy in silence) that she’s trying to surpass her stage of conception Brock rhymes with Regirock thus how can she succeed unless she proceeds to know what makes a conception so thus not so rhymes with Furfrow Brock please tell me Brock how he evolves one step more to become a Conkeldurr who thus wants always to be a Regirock but never a Chanedlure(all brust into laughter)..so I realized that his Mehu flower is the gross human essence of all these heinous ideas that is epitomized by utmost headless menaces like Conkeldurrs in his most absurdly dense mental plane(all laugh),so I said yeah I’ve to go to washroom excuse me(all laugh),then later this little Gyarados was too dejected and ofcourse did cry too cause my big bro says Seth is not only Seth(all laugh) so wasn’t talking with me(all laugh),so her sweet sweet bee brings her to me then says Brock you’re way older to her rhyming with Garbodor thus tell her now rhyming with eyebrow that why an eye rhyming with my becomes opposite to dry just as the eyebrow dips to ask me why oh why(all burst into laughter)..so this sweetened the Gyarados too much hence again viciously attacks him infront of me(all laugh),so I said yeah I understand the bonhomie but atleast this little brat should understand that it’s a fact that she’s my little sis too otherwise it’s hard to keep contact(all laugh),hearing this my little sis made a face and horribly namecalled me for spoiling her moment with her hubby(all laugh) and this pest I realized was playing a wicked game at the cost of his family and wife who being a headless Gyarados made it only all the more easy(all laugh) so I understood that my baby bro indeed is the most abominable pro(all laugh)”
Seth(laugh) : “indeed(all laugh)..man my Gyarados was something till entered into Cerulean CITY gym rhymes saw(all laugh)..CERULEAN!(all laugh..lot),but again now she’s back to that self hence I’m relieved rather cause I can never forget that day at Hoenn called her then during talks said such is life Seth(all laugh) I said yeah I’ll show you that for sure....but yeah in-between your baby sis met you Brock your other baby sis was told something as well(all laugh a lot,.s..lot)..”



,previously in the forest and shortly after I knew she was too much infatuated with me which is why I was suspicious even more given my experiences mentally then(all laugh) but then by this incident I realized that she thinks I’m her best friend(all burst into laughter and .) so because I’ve got a best-girl-Mehadi-friend(all laugh) then she’s not a girl(all burst into laughter) thus my wife-Mehu-as-best-friend-wife(all laugh) so after Yellowburst I said you’re my best friend(all laugh) can I call my best friend as Mehu(all laugh) and ate me up almost and hugged me to death for like eternity(all laugh) so the distance was just enough lone(all laugh)..but i said that because i thought she didn't need this form at all cause i thought ok this is a being then just conveyed my thanks to her when she slapped me(all laugh..lot),i thought does she know me then saw her tending to Chu and again shouting how i was careless now this seemed ridiculous to me given the preceding 14 years why would anyone believe that a cunning pro like me would get into water with an electric type brat all alone when it was universally known how any wild brat would come to us anyway and most importantly why(all laugh..lot) i thought of this whole logic actually why else how could i validate that it wasn't contemplation but reflection so that i can contemplate while reflecting why what's the surprise in it Dase what(all un..,Daisy..GHASTLY The Playboy Syndrome,all un..)..well i can never forget how my flower looked when i told you're a playgirl(all laugh..lot)..she was incensed cause i never spoke in reflection why what's the trouble in it Dase where(all un..,Daisy..FACETIME read FACE COMES IN BYTES,all un..)..well still it was given a projector which in general for me ILLUMINED for half of an hour ALONE(all laugh..lot).."
Poppy(scowl,same..,Goran..) : "atleast it wasn't CONVERSION OF PHENOMENA ONLY RESERVATION OF DILEMMA take that you namecall(all un..,Goran..Breezy FLOWER GLEAM,all laugh..,Poppy frowns at him,Goran laughs..).."
Seth(laughing) : "too barometric(all laugh..lot)..
Poppy(irritated,..) : "shut up you lowlife!your beau is far worse at dichotomous labeling of notion(all un..).."
Seth(laughing..) : "temporally or quarterly yeah(all laugh..lot,Mehadi,Goran and Poppy all burst..)..anyway,then the first time i see Mehu and she after slapping me now dictates my pace(all laugh..lot),so i asked her if she thinks that Chu was hurt PHYSICALLY unlike her estimation mentally why what's the problem in it Dase what(all burst..,Daisy..THE MEANING OF MATERIAL ALBUM,all un..)..well it's not that i was told when asked are you doing leagues or contest,SHUT UP YOU NAMECALL!HOW DARE YOU CHALLENGE MY EMOTIONAL QUOTIENT um.. KNOWLEDGE(all un..,Goran..BREEZY FLOWER GLEAM,Poppy too un..)..man i asked Gorrie what is this huh atleast her baby sis is patient in conversation(all laugh..lot),he said this(all laugh..lot,Goran and Poppy laugh..).."
..(recording,Goran and Seth after Goran met Poppy first time psychophysically)..
Goran(thoughtful) : "surrounding the honesty in intellect is the notion of inductive WING(all un..,..THE CLINICAL ONES,all un..)/thus in reflection morality pops up added with emotion welcome to the world of procedure while the process only asked of itself to be in referential SWING(all un..,..CRITIQUES OF SANITY,all un..)"..
so i said yeah congrats find some formal witnesses(all un..),indeed for you that being not mental(all un..),logically(all un..),perspectively(all un..),best epistemological wishes/conscious whisper or metaphysical quizzes..hallow never hi(all un..),sentence of sentience the attentively reflective squishes..welcome never bye(un..,all un..,Mehadi,Goran and Poppy un..),anyway(all laugh..lot,..LASTLY A CRITICAL PHANTOM),then as i asked my intellectual Gyarados a mental question she frowned and said yeah physically hurt because unlike you he isn't trying to be in terms of apprehension rotationally smart only sowing his phenomenal confusion into geometric turf(all un..,Gary and Goran..TOFFEE-FLOWER).."
Mehadi(frown..,..) : "shut up you namecalls!i'm way better at handling hydration of categorical nominals not stitching through pervasive binomials in characteristics(all un..,Seth..YOUNG Flower DREAM,Mehadi frowns..,Seth laughs.. er)"
Seth(laughing..) : "man my Gyarados was something back then which is the real form infact(all laugh..lot),anyway then after that i thought ok may be she thinks that i took my starter as a general trained pokemon but none still made any sense now while thinking i saw Chu he was injured a bit and my Gyarados was looking at me now minutely with a so sweet sweet frown(all laugh..lot,Daisy..too sweetie,..)..well atleast i didn't think like yeah Seth she was detached from abstractions, but wasn't confronting her attention to it being logical, in her rationalism only in progressive monism(all un..,..DR JACKAL,all un..,Tracey shakes..)..anyway now after this i realized she's irritated about this situation but i didn't understand any reasoning behind(all laugh..lot) cause it was because why i wasn't taking Chu to a pokecentre but that is what i was doing to start with was to comfort him a bit for the moment to make sure i can take him there and it took like 3 minutes to 4(all laugh..lot) now this whole thing happened within 8 minutes certainly way below 10(all laugh..lot) but 8(all laugh..lot,Violet..PLAYBOY COUNTER,all laugh..),well atleast i wasn't saying like,shut up!how dare he question me on conditioning of emotions not abolishment of relations(all un..,..THE UNFOLDED ONES,Brock and Violet un..)..so was normal(all laugh..lot)..anyway then it wasn't more than 8 minutes from i moment i regain my physical consciousness then i said ok now comes the logical time so i asked for the key of her bike which she gave me with same look now i realized this is all because she doesn't like the fact that what i'm doing wasn't by following her directions which wasn't there at all she only shouted at me exactly what i was doing but the degree was varying each time in comparison(all laugh..lot) so anyway this went on for no reason then the last couple of minutes were only looking at me(all laugh..lot) now i took the bike none asked me of my identity though(all laugh..lot) anyway took the bike and suddenly thought just before starting that hang on this could be the real cauldron of logic cause her behaviour wasn't normal neither mine i wouldn't have observed her antics so closely otherwise(all laugh..lot) and i was so happy whizzed past and heard her screaming and jumping saw that in the mirror so the moment i did that i realized i was fooling around with her which never was the case before cause in other cases there was only intention to say that how i'm identical to another in the upended for by cajoling things that i would say in argument of the other but this time i liked that she was the other and not me so on my way i thought i like this game you know Doctor Slate and Mrs Slate i like this game(all laugh..lot,Brock and Violet..LASTLY A PLAYBOY HUMDRUM,all burst..)..well it wasn't like,excuse me Gorrie,shut up you namecall!how dare you question his presence um..disturb us for no reason regarding intellect only percepts um..concepts(all un..,Gary and Genkai..THE SMOOTH ONES,all un..,Goran and Poppy un.. ..),yeah spot on man absolutely was(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i went to the centre then the rest of the phenomenas took place and all but from then 1 and half months later that day itself as I said Mehu I married Mehu as well as did she if not before(all laugh) cause once she wasn’t a girl she was my best friend(all laugh)....,yeah actually that pest Max once asked me bro um..how do you see sis(all laugh),I instantly recalled a question during a certain Ransei from home journey(all laugh..lot),what would i talk her Seth last time she asked why i wasn't vindictive of her being rather than only my recurrent meticulousness to conceptualize it rather than actualize it meaning she was thinking about personal sell outs not professional buy outs,CREATURES(all un..,..LILLIE FLOWER,Gary and Lillie un..ach other) still better than Dr jackal though who said um all these cosmetics doesn’t this get your skin a bit um.. aging(all brust into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) still better than advises on how to keep it disease free though(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) I only said don’t use them they damage your skin rather at the cost of ego(all burst into laughter) atleast the logic is easier to understand.... so to Max I said hmm..tickling..hmm..(all laugh)..this was at Ransei the month before he started at Kanto so was what he was too knowledgeable but as much naive ofcourse given the influences(all laugh..lot) we all understood that and his big Torchic wisely nodded this and thinks himself to be a pokemon master huh!pokemon master(all laugh)..he said um but the battle of wits(all laugh a lot)..SHUT UP!(all laugh),atleast he went down to his knee in the end(all burst into laughter)..man my sweet Torchic and her baby pest both are something(all laugh) anyway for baby pest the age then meant COUNTERING(all laugh..lot) so I said why suddenly(all laugh) he was disappointed said no you know with that show and all sis did a couple at the gym trials recently ofcourse and ofcourse cause of her name and the show and mostly cause of Ruth it has become widespread really and a few that I know at Hoenn was teleported here a few hours back thanks not to Yamasks(all laugh) they know that i know her personally so was talking and i only told them she doesn't need enhancements only fools will discuss these things not the meanings(all laugh..lot) then they said this and that and it’s just not right no matter they think they're world beaters now after 2 weeks with an Azurill that's the only wise decision in 3 times(all laugh..lot,Tracey bursts..)..no it's a shame man for 36 years atleast battle her once for heaven's sake(all laugh..lot) anyway then hearing him I laughed and said welcome to sanity(all laugh) then he said yeah I get it like you are linked with innumerable people including sis the most,i said yeah countering why(all un..,..LASTLY A DISCIPLE PLAYBOY,all un..,Mehadi too un.. oy)..well that's the only reason to not include her in my family excluding all else from the friend list cause we weren't officially married so then neither can they marry us off as if DESTINY(all laugh..lot) nor can they come up with other people's names only forms,countering(all un..,Daisy..look-only-at,all un..,un..as does Mehadi)..but(all laugh..lot) when i was traveling alone in places after Kanto i always thought that journeys take place atmost 2 years and 8 months minus the starting month so the next 6 can be more ensuing if i'm not found at places(all laugh..lot,Poppy scowls  oran very firmly,Goran laughs..lot   and tendering her).."
Poppy(frown,same pose) : "atleast i wasn't READING THE LINES ONLY WORDS take that you lowlife(all un..,Seth..INCENTIVE OVERDOSE,all un..,Poppy too un..silence)"
Seth(laughing..) : "yeah unlike only a third of the half time(all laugh..lot),anyway then Max says but um..it just felt bad you know even to me so to you thus I was thinking I’ll leave next month itself just a few days left but after that as a model if I face same thing..(all burst into laughter)..man baby pest is baby pest indeed(all laugh) so I said why what did they do,no it's..,no no see they didn't do the same things with me but i told them of them they didn't understand the boundlessness and said but i said my ideas from me remains detached..doer then Phantom as i heard shh..it was

you as well once you get deeper in your just current journey and so on but it won’t matter cause I’ve seen the non cosmeticed part as well you may know there’s a reason why there’s a phrase called flesh and blood in relation to these(all laugh) if you know that you won’t get these in general the natural things we all understand but that is like I remember a great example once heard that like a mosquito bite makes no sense to contemplate over are these of no use to contemplate over but it’s not easy due to having the similar body and mind thus your own mind has same propensities hence you have to be extremely careful no matter a saint or a sinner cause until you’re out of it absolutely you’re never safe and only and only you will know absolutely beyond doubt when you are safe but never before and hence you can’t stop to strive for that point cause it’s huge joy there due to lack of point of references thus even if you’re married still you have to be cautious specially if you think you are not a not male(all laugh) cause in the case of the psychophysically complement forms to that of ours as it appears to us currently(all laugh) have a lots of things to be distracted with with first and foremost the major responsibility of unearthing a future spoiled brat(all laugh) then to foster the brat despite his wishes not her cause atleast the brat wants to return to the abstraction why drag him here(all laugh) this my Sableye ever says all it requires to tickle(all laugh) cause the brat himself will recognize the unbinding thus will make self demands methodically only when he knows the feeling,maddening(all brust into laughter)..yeah that’s the Sableye dictum that Mehu was enlightened upon by the brat on the marriage day(all laugh) so I said yeah they have responsibilities to stay more distracted..so it’s in a way more difficult for us hence more care is needed and only thus marriage is helpful in a way that your happiness in human form is constantly with you and the viseversa hence it helps but only helps never erases the issue till you’re like a monk when your spouse is ready enough to be nun never anything else takes place cause then it’s not possible at all that indeed it’s your soulmate as the progress is shared everywhere,anyway(all laugh),so I said thus marriage helps,the word and idea soulmate helps if practised,the idea of full unbinding that my brats seek helps(all laugh),but this all only helps till you do get unbounded whaich my brats call that maddening tune that they are searching for(all laugh) so only then will these go but we have to strive cause that is bigger joy as it doesn’t end like thse with flesh and blood hence this is to be treated like a mosquito bit by every means dilligently by shifting the focus yet cutting the propensity that even dissapointed you off cause you can’t fight the world as then you’re fighting your won shadow cause your bais is I’m them yet not them just like your shadow it’s hence not removeable thus all you do is to focus on yourself more that itself will give you your spouse cause your spouse will think in the absolute same line thus the bond is natural inexplicable but tangiblly most joyous cause it takes you away from psychophysicality this is excerpted with the language being kept intact at most places from the lecture series Unattached in bushes thus Tracey of Pasio truces by Dr jackal(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) who in the same series said it’s always better to get married and force yourself into your current unless before that you do find your soulmate then you will yourself know only if you want to know by practising the paths of indifference but trying to find anything always leads to your doom cause you will find many more that you have to cut off in order to get your goal but if the mind isn’t UNATTACHED(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) then it’s impossible almost hence it is always just that you must know who your spouse is in abstraction defined by you yourself nothing else as your sis-in-law herself used to do in a way when she was in school(all laugh)..,and you now surely understand her practises has given her enough stability to live through the stuff she hasn’t been helped by her brats that I’ve ever had as you’re seeing with Feraligator,Crawdaunt,Sableye and Banette to start with(all laugh) which still excludes Solgy and Tyrie cause Tyrie has been with me since birth once forced him into a sanctuary after end of Hoenn as you know almost killed everyone saying why would the difference persist(all laugh) and Solgy I asked have you ever breeded by means of pictures and all he said when I woke up that is his birth it continues accprding to him as a miserable illusion(all laugh),so said when I woke up I saw someone who was my mom so I was ok but then I saw a few who were not my mom but with whom my mom behaved in a certain way(all laugh) but they were of my physical form mental too(all laugh) but strangely for me the difference between mental planes never persisted hence I understood I have to go there(all laugh) cause I once saw a brat was with another then they were happy but when they parted still happy but the other existed only in thoughts so it struck me like a thunderbolt that if the other was always there why is he outside as well(all laugh)..then during breeding season I saw how they were trying to force their mental ideas upon others fuelled by the hints blinking across their mental planes by this illusive physique conceptualized only from their image of the perfection that only became more distorted cause they refused to admit it was them hence said no no my dear only you that I name as my beau exactly when their ideas changed again said only this much just so lame,hence I realized creatures(all brust into laughter)..then I asked why this difference persist,I realized I must evolve so evolved that very day then I realized there’s still a way more to evolve but the two paths were different one was Lunala another Solgaleo but I thought Solgaleos were more in plight with the rage hence I chose that one cause the most disturbence the more became the craze hence the plight against which I I might find more progress cause a few Lunalas tried to be steady once got a few that were sturdy couldn’t stay the same(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..atleast Solgaleos were more outspoken hence could atleast could claim(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..so I became Solgaleo then a few came around despite me they said I like you I said but the same feeling in purity is ever there inspite me(all brust into laughter) hence actually whose whose beau(all laugh and cheers for Choiced BRATS,all laugh even more)..then you came master brat asked me to differentiate between closely knit and compact(all brust into laughter) I then thought you must’ve wanted to know the former depends on another still as the latter has become a pro(all
laugh) but then I understood it’s just your own plight that you thought that I too might become self established that you will never be master brat cause the asnwer to the question is when an idea of difference comes it’s all cause you think you’re this that you give a birth thinking another of that eternal piece that you really want cause you already know hence want to go the full length hence fail cause the idea of whole is only you


but as was saying this mosquito bite unmindfullness is natural some people are born like that some make themselves like that you saw my big sis at Marengo and know about her none says a word of anything but admiration about her but all aren’t like that she is rather in the unique class of people hence so naive(all laugh) and thus you won’t like it at all if you develop this view dilligently as much as you can and then still if the propensity remains you won’t stay single but when you get your wife like me who is like that to me despite the official tag(all laugh) you will know your wife beyond body and mind and only thus will your wife be your wife the heavenly entity beyond specifications and and of time and space professed the great Doctor Slate(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs)..otherwise THUNDURUS(all laugh) professes Tony boy(all laugh) thus if these are about your very own soulmate it will pain you a bit but then you forget it quickly if you remember that exact word you should instantly get into the plane of soul thus the psychophysicality vanishes hence your soulmate is in real form there appearing in your mind now hence you see only that light and don’t remember anything else thus with a happy and clear mind do you proceed forward the cloud having come and gone exactly as they are said Dr Gary Oak in the lecture WHY AM I/ON-THE-FLY(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncotrollably laughs  ary)..so yeah like that(all laugh) then the little pest was too happy(all laugh) said yeah I realized also why May became so angry last day when I said your beau is no different to such and such in appearance atleast(all laugh) I said yeah this will be pungent to you even more but I’m sure you yourself realize that once your own sis starts to get titles starting from this one itself unless for her beau(all laugh) and name same thing will happen despite she herself traveling with her fiancee still just as you know of my compeers Cladlie and Scarlie atleast none could ask them directly(all laugh) so these happen man you’re too nice at your very heart thus never cared until now this exact thing is called psychophysicality and not only the latter cause the two are most intricately interlinked that I understood may be at 5(all laugh) when a female brat giggled at me saying in this tone Seth..(all brust into laughter),anyway(all laugh),so I imitated her to Mr Oak(all brust into laughter) then this I continued(all laugh) Mr Oak in that same tone in reply said professionalism(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) and continued it(all laugh) we both very soon were mocked so became Madgaleo(all laugh)..then we understood it’s called genderhood but we didn’t understand the source of the difference cause the appearance ever perished once we were forced to mentally get engaged(all laugh)?


and you will fight against it by yourself but make it fun rather else it’s just despondency nothing more having to carry around flesh and blood for like 80 to 100 years depite your own mind telling you you’re way above hence life is hard but funny ain’t it bro thus in raptures pass your days without any thought of the clock said Mr Fox on being questioned why don’t you confess to your beau to or fro(all brust into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs)..so yeah these were the things that were going on in my mind when I first saw Mehu flower(all laugh),yeah thanks for perseverance with the name(all laugh),yeah thanks again(all laugh),anyway back to beauty(all laugh) so I said the concerned gym leader would win Kalos if not married at 7th then marriage then Unova if marriage was anytime before done(all laugh) and if just before Kalos would’ve got divorced(all laugh)..no this one isn’t about my activites(all laugh) Mehu would’ve been in serious trouble if she married before Kalos cause that
life would’ve shocked her if Sinnoh didn’t had she got good travel companions but Mehu would’ve been in hall of fame had I not existed but I just think for her if she was single was more suitable for general training like me cause you need to look after yourself the most cause all aren’t like me that I had a family member till my 7th journey but if she married or was in a relation be it in or out of profession or travel companions or not would’ve been in trouble in general training cause the cultures beyond Hoenn would’ve shocked her if not Sinnoh Unova and Kalos would’ve and she would’ve been in trouble there anyway I then continued,the second possibility is, Kanto,Johto,Hoenn,Pasio,Frontier,Sinnoh then the next two but here if Sinnoh is tried before frontier lost(all laugh) if Johto before Kanto Kanto would’ve been won then same and no matter and you understand that Johto or Kanto would’ve been tried frist if Pasio is first career might have been jeopardized unless good travel companions(all laugh) and so on so I gave you two main branches and then definitely 7, 5 sure Ivana toss(all laugh) so yeah hall of fame definitely but no chance of winning the first league(all laugh) and Lance as well(all laugh) then they said,well first what would it take to beat Lance and then about your assesment of your position(all laugh) I said well to beat Lance you can’t get under his skin ever(all laugh) cause he is a master of mind games himself and has been cause he himself is 6,7 champ(all laugh) and beaten during his time the unbeatable Sinnoh Elite4 head Katya of all people(all laugh) and on the way beating Laura of all legends(all laugh) his career was that he’s from Indigo Platue itself(all laugh) and his career is 1st region Kanto-win,2nd Kanto Frontier-win,3rd Johto-win,4th Pasio-win upto here look at his shrewd regional selection despite getting 4 pseudo-legends in his very first region- Solgaleo,Cresselia,Kyogre and Heatran of all legends(all laugh) and still how grounded and each league got better,5th Kalos-win,Kalos of all places at 5th being from Kanto and was a big margin win against a 5 time champ in 7th region huge,6th Unova-win,7th Sinnoh-win ,8th Hoenn- win,Elite4 was Kalos-win,Sinnoh-win with Katya at number 2(all laugh),Johto-win,Unova-win his days Unova was 2nd toughest and Unova discourages it’s best champs to be Elite 4 heads else all will revolt(all laugh),Kanto-win,Hoenn-win,Pasio-win and his career after Hall of Fame shows only 4 losses(all laugh) and one in last 15 and 3 in the previous 10(all laugh) out of which 1 came before being Elite4 head(all laugh) and in his 21 year Elite4 leadership in his first 5 years the most tumultus time as well(all laugh) when he lost twice one against Ms Sakura surely you know her(all laugh) and the other was against Mrs Ophelia Breemer who only could beat him at her first Elite4 then didn’t get into hall of fame is in the general leagues and your very senior colleague here(all laugh) and in internal matches between hall of fame which they must resist my bunch from enterning or at worst intruding(all burst into laughter) cause now intruding is what they want to increase the fun(all laugh) said,well that could be perfect Gengar version(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah but not proper at all(all laugh) anyway,Lance’s record there too is phenomenal and I don’t know the details of that much cause so much statistics is hard(all laugh) but all I know is that outside of Percy,Marc,Iris,Galaxy and David he has lost only 5 matches in last 15(all laugh) that too 1 against Katya and another two I can’t recall but a legendary name again so you understand how good he is that his average of total loss is one in 3.72 years(all laugh) and the only reson people don’t call him a legend and so on is because he’s against all those that are bigger legends than any in authority sections(all laugh) so Lance can only be beaten but every time so(all laugh) if only he is raced indifferently(all burst into laughter) that is cause Lance’s mindset is to enjoy a long comeptitive race with many mind games and in the end whatever be the result hug-it-out(all laugh) so that is to be countered by being dejected and joyous at life at the same time(all burst into laughter) to confuse him about the purpose of racing(all laugh) cause the competition is that the opponent wants to discuss philosophy as well during race while patting Lance’s bunch to the finish line to see if they understood that win and loss didn’t really matter(all burst into laughter) disconnect his bunch from him by saying like my beau left me(all burst into laughter) but no not what you think just died aged(all uncontrollbaly laugh,.) but yeah the other one I’m interested in no a days for the illegal bit(all uncontrollbaly laugh) has a few kids who are rather well behaved for their age(all burst into laughter) this if continues like this would give a symbol that the race isn’t a factor cause my bunch is indifferent to life enjoying the race AS the life not WITH the life that’s the difference(all laugh) so if so it means racing as life in their sense is that as their life goes on the race to to their job and so long a prolonged life and in human life and theirs it’ll decimate the battle instinct(all laugh) and Lance will have to budge cause his bunch will tell himthat why are you not allowing us to give a thought on thought that life is long with turns if not twists(all uncontrollbaly laugh,.) then your bunch should feed the twists too to rev it up(all burst into laughter) and so on just make the race mental(all laugh) thus they are lost in thoughts are if the thoughts are interesting to them to get indifferent to things like battling Lance isn’t helping them ever(all laugh) but thus you see that is the method and you understand the preparation is very hard(all laugh) said,yeah that’s the psychic game we were thinking of that you and your bunch was playing and every bit is true but exactly if these are said to the press by a Gengar(all burst into laughter) then the result is like you and your bunch but what if it’s applied on you(all laugh) I sadi,yeah well about Gengars telling philosophy I guess as you said and if this is applied aginst my bunch they will be too jovial joking about remembreing that the dead beau said to propel the next that bit higher and so on(all burst into laughter,.) and thus yeah they are just playfull so the challenger too will be playfull and thus then it’s level ground where the one that fools around longer will win and that’s my bunch won me Pasio so many years ago(all laugh and .) so no the uniqueness
of the bunch is a matter but what matters is how much a Gengar the master is(all burst into laughter) which again will first inherent qualities then about situations like I’ve had peace at home to continue my journey and so on and yeah to me since my 2nd league and certainly after Hoenn it was the mental game that is no energy wasted cause I’m not battling at all(all laugh and .) so yeah even a Gyarados could thus be beaten by Weavile of all(all laugh) the McShin miracle(all laugh) said,yeah somehow the preparation is strange(all laugh) and we think that even if you tell everything to others exactly what a Gengar does(all burst into laughter) cause a Gengar doesn’t think to hide cause it doesn’t know what is hiding as it’s never serious and doesn’t know what is thinking(all burst into laughter) so yeah life is twists and turns of Gengar(all laugh) and thus so hard to do in a millenia(all laugh) I said well millennia is just a number but in next year someone would come up with this but you see if two Gengars meet never can a battle happen so neither he or she nor me can be beaten at all cause that makes no sense at all(all laugh and .) said,yeah but we don’t believe that anyone in last millennia shared your thoughts if not 2350(all laugh) or even if did it was theory(All laugh) so yeah strange thing but what about your career assesment with and without the gym leader(all laugh) and ours too(all burst into laughter) I said,well first you careers I’m seeing you after one year and this is 5th meeting or 8th (all burst into laughter) so I might be absolutely wrong and I saw only so few from your bunch and so on so yeah hard but I guess I know that water gym was selected cause first sentiments but more so as my bunch was Tyranitar and Solgaleo and Yveltal and so on(all laugh) though they are nasty but not as nasty as Crawdauntogator is(all burst into laughter) none is infact(all laugh) and Crawdaunt is still more well behaved than Feraligator(all laugh) who is less nasty than Crawdaunt(all burst into laughter) and so on so they are real meance to peace but if Yveltal wants he can match them as can any(all laugh) but that is if they are in the mood these two always are(All laugh) but these are barring my ghost group(all laugh) but they aren’t nasty they are just frivolus beyond imagination(all laugh) but that can be as nasty as well(all laugh) but all these excludes Gengar and Sableye and Darkrai and Giratina and Confragigus and Hoopa and of course Ultranercozma(all laugh) so you see that I like this exact thinking process from my point of view and then if I were at your situation cause Crawdauntogator beat team rocket and the 3 pseudo lenegds were so mad battling that much fun they can have now and the ghosts are ghosts(all laugh) so then yeah my thinking to go to a water gym was right but to engage my bunch in a longer fun was to select a grass gym(all laugh) cause they want to eat the food slowly in abnormal situations only(all laugh) reverse otherwise(all laugh) and then the next best option was water gym so with all the views taken my views are that starting at Johto was absolutely right and then Frontier too was extremely prudent and right then Sinnoh was all wrong(all laugh) just that idea to show more than prudence the just previous selection that Pasio league was inferior to Sinnoh(all laugh) which isn’t the case at all as you now know there’s no easy leagues at all cause Unova says Kalos is child’s play thus doesn’t win at all(all laugh) and Kalos has same opinion about Kanto thus the result(all laugh) Kanto people like me think Johto is easier than Hoenn and thus I failed there(all laugh) in general Hoenn and Unova only respects Pasio who has to respect all being smallest region for money(All laugh) and Kanto’s respect order is inferiors are Pasio and Kalos(all laugh) Kalos most so that none bothers to go there and the vise versa despite being geographical neigbours and yet goes to Sinnoh(all laugh) which has less turns more twists and Kalos the opposite(all laugh) and the whole world is afraid of Unova but I guess my bunch has mitigated that as has my dragons(all laugh) which I think has only been helpful(all laugh) if only they can go ans see first hand understanding properly what dragons actually are that is(all laugh) like Kommo-O gang at Huntelion yeah(all laugh) for their ego and our fear especially Kanto-Johto group(all laugh) and Sinnoh fears Kanto more than Unova(all laugh) Hoenn has nightmares thinking of Unova(all laugh) and Kalos are submissive to them(all laugh) Pasio are revolutionaries against them cause of the runaway groups(all laugh) and Unova looks down upon everyone most Kalos but barring Pasio cause the ones they can’t catch here does from there cause the dragonic density per inhabitation is less(all laugh) and so on for all regions it’s a huge chart will take whole day(all laugh) so Pasio if was tried or Hoenn for that matter would’ve got upto semi finals sure if not win and then 4th Hoenn or Sinnoh any would’ve won definitely but if Hoenn then Pasio again Pasio was lost(all laugh) cause the start to Hoenn was the illusion but for the right reasons of skills and thus was fine but those skills of her are no good in Pasio only in general training not as a gym leader(all laugh) as a gym leader she would’ve been same everywhere barring Kalos where she isn’t a hall of famer but a very good leader only hall of famer if her husband or boyfriend is very supportive or she is single and so on(all laugh) but again totally barring Unova(all laugh) where she can’t run a gym her husband must do that or if single then take up general training or contests or anything in the world possible cause first she doesn’t know that a Palkia is tamed only if the Palkian life is allowed to be led(all laugh) that is your Palika will take you as a direct challenger(all burst into laughter) and the more you love him the more ferocious would they become(all laugh) cause the Palkian life says that we’re the only water dragon with those chosen Kyurems(all laugh) and a few Rayquaza and Naganadel and so on immitates and irritates us(all laugh) we must become lie detectors(all laugh) and love haters first thing in life(all laugh) and thus being dragons they will challenge all to appease them is to feed them with ideas(all laugh) of family infighting killing own kids and so on(all laugh) then they will become thoughtfull of you as to why are you helping them in lie detecting(all laugh) then they will take you under their scales(all laugh) to teach you properly when you must cry your head off to them using sentimental cards(all laugh) that they don’t like you(all burst into laughter) thus they will be incensed with you(all laugh) and then you repeat the procedure(all laugh and .) then they will understand that you’re as clever as them cause that’s exactly what they do(all burst into laughter) then they are tamed and thus only the water gyms in Unova are prepared(all laugh) but catching a Palkia is different it requires you to threaten them first then when they are mad flee(all burst into laughter) then they are confused a few chosen ones like in group of 10 from a group of 12(all laugh) will hunt for you to see if you still are conspiring(All laugh) then you catch one BUT only if you pat them enough that you will help them in showing the world that they don’t want love(All burst into laughter) that is to let them have their way among your bunch(all laugh) and Palikas don’t fight seriously till the lie is detected before that is just enough to make friends and using sentiments again and again get under their scales to find the lie once found they can be unstoppable to tackle which is another epic(all laugh)..against Sharpedo this is what I was telling Dave to do(All laugh) but both of mine are absolute damn brats(all laugh)..then I continued that that is Palkian life and so on among dragons Palkia is most difficult to tame next to Giratina at 2(all burst into laughter) who can only be appeased if his full group likes you(all laugh) by tormenting you to death(all laugh) and no love their too just the fooling around with the whole world barring Latias and Latios who must be shown the better psychic plane of life first thing(all laugh) and Latios the exact same but they are happy to be ONLY with Giratinas(all burst into laughter) cause the leg pulling(all laugh) and those in Pasio pull legs of Dragonites(All laugh) and so on but there is Kyurem then(all laugh) which will take another day to give their deprivation nature that the whole world is not caring to them so they are cruel to the world(all laugh) and caring means they must let them battle whole day against any steel type(all laugh) and so on Kyurem is 3rd most difficult to tame as 4th (all laugh) as they live side by side with Hydreigons(all burst into laughter) who threatens the whole world cause they don’t like kids who are all except themselves(all burst into laughter) do you understand the first(all laugh),said,yeah whole world knows that one the great dragon fight pseudo legend one and only Kommo-O(all laugh),I say,what O stands for in light(all laugh),said,well Opacity can be applied that the idea about them needs to be cleared,I say,to not disturb them while catching(all burst into laughter),they said,well then what about them(alllaugh),I say,they live beside Garchomps(all laugh) said generally yeah(all burst..),i said know it is an accident you know(all laugh..lot),said no even if it is it's not feasible like it could be but this very moment it's useless idea of destiny(all burst..),so i said MISMAGIUS!(all burst) and yeah Garchomp’s motto of life is clarity in vision to decimate any approach of friendship(all laugh) thus they are easy to tame of course(all laugh) just feed them with ideas of ethics(all burst into laughter) by not challenging them but letting your Goodra roam raround amongst them(all laugh) then they will get the clear view that your Goodra is there to kill them then they won’t attack Goodra cause visibility says it’s you not Goodra(all laugh) thus they will charge at you and you must face that alone(all laugh) and call Goodra just say help if you attack you’re done(all laugh) so Goodra wants to save you to tem it means Goodra and
you are clear in vision that they are no friends(all burst into laughter) then thus going after one day one decides to test you(all laugh) if you beat him with type disadvantages pokemon of hhis choosing while he will demand to see your whole bunch(all laugh) and will choose one and fight them then if beaten that vision is established that your view is clear as the fact that you’re enemy to all like them(all laugh) and then they will follow you but Kommo-O is sick of this petulance(all laugh) thus they have opacity of view to everything(all laugh) thus anything that disturbs them like a leaf falls on their head while they will shake trees(all laugh) will disturb them enough to punch the next guy(all laugh) thus the idea of any kind love and hate will be punched(all laugh) Kommo-O view of life is that I don’t understand anything thus I don’t want to either(all burst into laughter) but I can(all burst into laughter) that is if I get get my ways of understanding while punching anything(all laugh) so this is about sudden feelings only(all laugh) so if a twig falls on Kommo-O head enough to invoke a feeling he will have that feeling means he will be disturbed cause first he won’t try to understand what this feeling is so he will punch the next guy(all laugh) who will punch the next cause of a feeling(all burst into laughter) thus in cycle O will come up and the first one will get punch back finally(all laugh) which makes him understand that the first and the punching another has pained my fists(all laugh) so now I’ve got it back thus it increases from very little to max thus it’s something to be disturbed about enough to think about it(all laugh) then Kommo-O will think about it by punching the next guy even harder than first to form anti cyclic O(all burst into laughter) so by the time he has finished his own thinking he will be punched again more forcefully to make him understand that it’s a skirmish that’s going on so what exactly was the first feeling once he realizes that it was a twig it will be alright for him to tell others did you feel anything(all burst into laughter) all else sill say only a punch nothing more so he will finally understand that only on his head the twig fell but you understand sudden feelings that’s outside of body only(all laugh) will come out of blue so many times so Kommo-O gets punched say 23220 times per half day(all laugh) and own body feelings wherever the feeling is will be punched(all burst into laughter) to see if that feeling is worthy enough to put any thoughts to while it is maximized to understand the minimum feelings impact on them(all laugh) then if skirmish among group then they will do the same thing repeating till they can’t continue anymore to understand such impacts but they are self heal masteres so it will be alright and then if an outsider comes they will punch him to understand if their feeling of disturbance caused by Kommo-O gang matches the Kommo-O feeling of disturbance or not if not so and Kommo-O created more fear in them then they will lecture the guy(all laugh) if his mom or beau is there who is less vulnerable than them so that they can the more punches than them(all burst into laughter) if they say yes they will punch you again to say tell them this punch and please we invite them here(all laugh) and he will be let go of and then if he says no then only Kommo-O will sympathise by saying ok then why don’t you bring your own group rather than the dear ones(all burst into laughter) then he will cry his head off which will make Kommo-O realize that this feeling wasn’t something they had while they started this trouble thus they will leave you saying life is hard(all burst into laughter) so you see a Kommo-O life is getting punched may be 60000 times per day(all laugh) thus when you go your bunch must disturb them long enough just in the outskirts of the inhibitation to make them feel disturbed for long enough to be not so(all burst into laughter) then a gang will come upto your pokemon and will start punch him left and right to understand the wild pokemon intruding feature till he cries then you will be summoned and your bunch will be asked to define if you’re his mommy if he says yes you will be punched(all laugh) if he says no then it means you’re a new chosen one so that same process will be applied(all laugh) thus he should only cry and not talk with you at all then Kommo-O gang will surround you(all laugh) and you must stay abolsutely silent there and they will want to know if you care about your pokemonyou won’t answer anything then one of them who is too interested about your view of life(all laugh) will come beside you(all laugh) and put his tail around your shoulder.) to ask your realtion to your pokemon then you will punch yourself(all burst into laughter) and that means a disturbance that you have but Kommo-O doesn’t have cause Kommo-O first volunteered to disturb you by putting his tail around your body and asking you a question yeah if Kommo-O is asked a question he will punch the questioner to see if questioning felt the same to the questioner as it did to him else how can his answer be understood which will be re punched to validate(all burst into laughter) so then your tears Kommo-O will interpret it as you’re a sweet little Jangomo-O(all laugh) cause this phenomena is when two Jangomo-O does after hatching they will be punched by mom(all laugh) to which they will punch back if that is good enough only then mom takes you otherwise his dad will be summoned(all laugh) and so on will go on to realize whom he will suit to hand over if none is found then it’s whole group’s responsibility to protect him till next punch(all laugh) thus any Jangomo-O who has mettle realizes the only way out of this is to punch himself(all laugh) after mommy punches him umpteenth time(all laugh) so this will mean mommy will prepare them to be Hakamo-O so that the punching ability is increased(all laugh) thus you must follow the same procedure to get a mommy for you and your bunch thus Kommo-O can’t be caught unless you go with a gang of yourself full of many pokemons and all but that will disturb Garchomp,Haxorus,Tryrunt,a few Guzzlords and so on(all laugh) like Noivern,Rayquaza a few and then Salamences are everywhere(all laugh) thus you will let Kommo-O to punch your whole bunch to get tamed and in gym he must be kept in a way so that he can lecture everyone about mettle(all laugh) by punching them(all laugh) and in initial months you will continue punching yourself to show you’re eternally a Jangomo-O so your bunch gets the Hakamo-O life not you(all laugh) so Kommo-O life is like that I met a few(all laugh) but they wisely pointed out that my bunch is already like Kommo-O gang cause they are more battle starved(all laugh) so I was spared as to I and my bunch could tell them something(all laugh) this is two gangs colliding and the way out is to tell them life is hard and leave(all laugh) that’s what we did and they did as well only then could I come out alive if you say life is hard without their permission you will be chased(all laugh) but we went right in a middle of their inhibitation(all laugh) so they understood we’re definitely philosophical about life cause that’s death(all laugh) this feeling will tell them to discuss issues that they face(all laugh) and so on so then we will become Kommo-O as well to live a few more days then the previous procedure so you see Kommo-O is something that is dangerous but all I said are my methods many people have Kommo-O but they are substandard(all laugh) this is Kommo-O max potential so such a Kommo- O will be tamed enough after sometimes to be even kept at bedroom(all laugh) if he fits there(all laugh) and then will wisely discuss with you on that day which among your bunch chosen ones punched him properly unlike your Cobalion(all burst into laughter) who is a kid so they will ask for your permission to show the Kommo-O way of life(all laugh) so if you can show him that you’re a Jangomo-O and your bunch is full mixture of all of their evolution will he be tamed cause this means he is disturbed but happy still unlike wild cause there they have to get food and all here they don’t and geeting food is to punch himself to see how hungry(all laugh) and they being pseudo-legends will continue stupendus psychic currents while doing all these(all laugh) and all these is to get him ready to be worthy enough for my bunch to take him further(all laugh) when he will be shown that we were tolerating him as little sweet Jangomo-O and so on then he will reach the max and then he doesn’t fight and will wisely say to anyone that yeah death is hard(all laugh) cause that is death to them they will be back to life if they are told death isn’t hard(all burst into laughter) which if someone manages he will not live anymore cause then Kommo-O will get the perfect student(all laugh) Kommo-O life is about 100000 punches and as many tail whips per day cause life is hard(all laugh) creatures aren’t they(all laugh),said,yeah life is hard(all burst into laughter) if one dragon takes that then a Palkia then Giratina,Kyurem,Latios,Zekrom(all laugh)..
cause they cherish so much(all laugh)..and so on Unova is hard(all laugh) but we realize that that Kommo-O himself can fetch atleast 6 leagues(all laugh) so why none came with you(all laugh),I said,no the philosophy didn’t match they thought they can’t add to our knowledge about them strangely(all laugh) so we were spared(all laugh)...now this Kommo-O Dave has one(all burst into laughter) what does he say about being sweet little Jangomo-O(all laugh)..”Gary(laugh) : “man if this Kommo-O gets my little boy then he will become an absolute brat(all laugh) no wonder you’re a chosen brat from absurdity(all laugh) none of the dragon taming methods are true(all laugh) only applies on his own exactly why they are damn brats(all laugh) with pokemons of his own it’s dishonestly honest hallucinations(all laugh) whatever he understands after reading about them then asks his bunch(all burst into laughter) whatever there goes on then will create an intuition and go and ask Kommo-O if that’s their life(all burst into laughter) then have a discussion and Kommo-O will get to know his life and his bunch and his Mehu flower everything(all laugh) then if agreement is reached they will come by themselves and with the familiarity become absolute brats(all laugh) that’s how Confragigus,Zekrom,Guzzlord,Giratina and Latios came and Gengar was asked of his opinions on life(all burst into laughter) Ultranercozma came generally cause it was too much bonhomie(all laugh) and Dave says each ghost or psychic or dark jumps on him and ghosts specially and all the time(all laugh) and each of Kalos came but Seth what can such a Kommo-O say your ideas..” Seth(smile) : “well no it depends upon individuals but may be wth Garchomp being here and all I guess he or she would’ve said like Dr Oak Dr Oak what are doing/Oh Mr Oak please stop what what youre doing(all laugh)/Dr Oak Dr Oak why are you always so mentally busy/please Mr Oak sit down with me else mental pressure will make you crazy(all burst into laughter) he would’ve wanted Mr Oak to sit down and have a coffee with him to discuss that mental pressure like punching to understand makes life easy(all laugh) so why not you tell him what is hard life(all burst into laughter) basically he would want to take your pen up and write his own opinions there(all laugh) reverse Dialga(all laugh) you must let him tell you who you are(all laugh) cause he will show you that your life is too sweet(all laugh) cynical brat like Ribombee and Yveltal but will tell you in clear language his minute opinions of your life like each moment how I’m thinking of bodyslamming Mehu flower or viseversa so that bodyslamming is easy for us why don’t we punch each other for a change(all laugh) then bodyslamming is more reved up to increase that FEELING(all laugh) methods to make your life hard cause it’s too easy(all laugh) all this to so you now he is dead cause he has moved over even hard life so circular reverse Dialga about as thorough as Zygarde more radical than Ribombee and less abstract than Yveltal(all burst into laughter) better not go anywhere near him but he would get the one and only Doctor Slate(all laugh) cause if life then that FEELING(all laugh) and Brock what about my failed attempt to get a Kommo-O thrice(all laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “they had a feeling that they are better being spared this life(all laugh) he went to most dreadful,average and most less dense inhibitations of dragons threatening Cili(all laugh) each took 5.5 days as you know he says since Frontier(all laugh) so 19*16.5 total 314 days and had thus 13 spared day(all burst into laughter) and this actually was more cause Noivern came may be 5 days after start(all laugh) and then anyway,had couple of weeks or so left got to Ultranercozma most dense area didn’t work cause his brat wasn’t there(all laugh) and then Huntelion and else didn’t go so this was after Garchomp and 6 months around after that so only 1 month was left said,’Cili we’re hungry(all laugh) all these dragons came but Kommo-O(all laugh)..’ Cilan before that took him once where Kommo-Os fled the scene cause he went with Weavile(all burst into laughter) then another was when he went with Torterra(all burst into laughter) but Torterra was so dangerous that even Kommo-Os said enough(all laugh) now these two were lest and middle dense the most infamous pokemon inhibitation pushing even Karapaskar to 2(all laugh) is Huntelion Valley,Jyriesleaf,Unova where none goes even pokemons(all laugh) except Garchomp of course(all laugh) and innumerable many but all are damn dragons(all laugh) like Tryrunt and Haxorus(all laugh) a few Guzzlords(all laugh) and of course Noivern,Rayquaza and Salamence(all laugh) so that was left and Cilan said then he wasn’t in even talking terms(all laugh) and was talking about cooking and all Iris was calling home 5 times a day(all laugh) and all else were counting the time to finals when this brat leaves the poor dragons(all laugh) comes up and says that Cilan said I begged him that man please you just return to ‘mam safely just 1 more month do as many gyms(all laugh) but please not that devil straight out of hell(all laugh),’Cili the longing the longing(all burst into laughter)’,Cilan said I told him look Kommo-O is the most loathed sepecis anywhere in the world cause their life is punch eat punch repeat(all laugh) those brats punch the next guy while sleeping if doesn’t get punched back wakes up(all burst into laughter) and if normally wakes up punches others to see if only hissleep has been disturbed(all burst into laughter) and no Kommo-O is no harm to you but you made me immortal by making me sympathize for them(all burst into laughter) cause none ever did that and if that brat enters your gang and will take one week to get battle starved and then reach the most lunacy right on the final day then please poekmons have families(all burst into laughter) and I know you,you will go to Huntelion with Noctowl(all burst into laughter),’No alone(all burst into laughter)’,Cilan thought finally he has gone truly mad so said mate plase we need to talk(all laugh),’kryopthic-liftus-kranptomos-logzysic-menrorufsmos-sychogomic-SUBTLE body(all burst into laughter) recently found has to test(all laugh)’,this is Kommo-O known highest subtle body possibility in their psychic spheres if it’s applied on a normal human being(all laugh) when they are most swelled up(all laugh) but if with Seth it would’ve become the legend of Umbronapthagum max normal+a few(all laugh)’,so Cili said please atleast leave one dragon not come with you if of all it’s a Kommo-O they will ban you for sure cause that devil will will enter the commentary box cause he would’ve been disturbbed by the sound(all laugh) and all you need to do is to release him and say please calm down(all laugh) that means he will set out to judge who else is more calm than him beyond death(all laugh) then will ask for their relations(all laugh) said please man not that devil(all laugh),Cili sweet kids(all laugh) I’m going two days later don’t you cherish me(all laugh) then went there Noctowl was with him of course(all laugh) but only as a protection(all laugh) and Cili and Iris was protected on baloon used binoculars(all laugh) that valley is adventure horror(all laugh) so a bit is used to show people how dangerous pokemons are so that less number of people become trainers cause keeping dragons in gyms is costly(all laugh) and Cilan and Iris their protection was Hoopa and Aegislash(all laugh) they hired a balloon by their identity(all laugh) Chu was with Cilan(all laugh) and Charizard in the ball with Cilan(all laugh) and won’t come out at all if he released would immediately return(all laugh) and Noctowl was of course there(all laugh) at a bit lower in altitude and Noctowl’s vision was used so that any trouble she could spot(all laugh) was connected to Confragigus newfound power then(all laugh) and he there only had only Confragigus(all laugh) who was may be 14 month old(all laugh), went on Charizard strainght jumped into the middle(all laugh) then he went there came back Cili could hardly watch after a whole Kommo-O gang surrounded him(all laugh) then he comes back with Noctowl on Charizard again then says like,Ah!Cili where am I(all laugh),Cilan didn’t know what to do(all laugh) said,Ah!that medicine I told you 30 brats fondled my nerves for 15 minutes each 6 times with 5 minute breaks(all burst into laughter) then gets medicines which were illegal(all laugh) and was dissapointed said went with them in subtle spheres these brats didn’t want to be my family(all burst into laughter) Confragigus facilitated the meeting from my side and I was alone first time with totally wild pokemons that too Kommo-O(all laugh) previously I had a pokemon to show them why they are with me this time they themselves realized what I’m(all laugh) but they misbehave in subtle bodies sweet little kids so innocent(all burst into laughter) total two hours and 35 minutes was with them nice society,thoughtfull governance(all burst into laughter) 15 minutes they gauged me then meeting then after two hours I was realeased(all laugh) still passed 10 more minutes to get back to senses(all laugh) then saw them off in last 5 and returned they offered me foods and drinks though(all uncontrollbaly laugh) but I had to decline saying won’t be able to digest they were sympathetic said yeah we understand life is hard(all burst into laughter) but didn’t get any response though I said this this my bunch does and what is their life they spoke of their life and asked about my family and health(all burst into laughter) but it just didn’t materialize that deal to live together(all burst into laughter) they said no I can’t do much for them and viseversa in terms of happiness(all laugh) the agreement didn’t happen the aparment sharing that is(all burst into laughter) nice persons good family has kids much reponsibility yeah told me so true life is hard Cili indeed(all burst into laughter) Confragigus connected Seth to Kommo-O gang and then Seth spoke with them letting wild pokemons fondle his nevers(all laugh) that too of all in this world had to be Kommo-O at Huntelion(all laugh) no wonder his bunch is vulgar(all laugh) then after Kommo-O rejected him did he become sad before that was mad(all laugh) and Seth says as you know first Garchomp hesitated then Kommo-O said nothing he can add to(all laugh) meant he was dishonest and Mehu flower was Mehadi Waterflower so fled(all laugh) Cilan says that day I understood I must flee the next day morning after the finals(all laugh) more than 1400 years ago Tryvon Hans Kenneth Moulier(all laugh) could do what Seth was upto(all laugh) all in Unova knows his name and no he wans’t a trainer like us of course(all laugh)nothing much is known about him just that he specialized in fighting types and specially Kommo- O fighting(all laugh) and is a mythical name at Unova to the known spheres and Cili said may be that man is communicating with Seth(all laugh) he told Seth who said I see if we could talk then the lives would’ve been known to me more,inspiration Cili inspiration,real inspiration(all laugh) but was there gyms then Cili(all burst into laughter) Cilan said if the two met Unova would’ve given up their pokemon profession completely(all laugh) but that was his first attempt then Kalos each came like that(all laugh) but he took his gang there around the inhibitation then fooled around with them those attracted themselves came(all laugh) then was rejected(all burst into laughter) with those who didn’t want to go new pokemons like Heatran(all laugh) after Heatran was with him for 2 days 3rd day the penultimate day of 8(all laugh) will be with Heatran to Heatran home(all laugh) again subtle body BUT by Heatran(all burst into laughter) Musharna stayed with Heatran cause she was only 2 days old(all laugh) so might have troubles reading Seth thus Musharna was there to help them(all laugh) if necessity arose only(all laugh) and he will speak with all other Heatrans(all laugh) that their friend is with him is he not a Heatran as well as a Musharna as well(all laugh) thus is proved he can be with many beaus(all laugh) own untamed pokemon of 2 days first doing his subtle body and then at own home(all laugh) and you know what Heatran home is(all laugh) and his facilitator was suspicious of him(all laugh) Musharna was only there to tell Heatran if anything was needed(all laugh) and if Musharna attacked anyone Seth wou’ve been lost in darkness(all laugh) so Musharna was under pressure as well but that Musharna was this one fire can talk(all laugh) so himself didn’t bother about master brat cause they know once Heatran has come by herself won’t leave cause outside only substandard food is there(all laugh) Confragigus could still save Seth cause he was his own pokemon despite being attacked cause he knew Seth’s state and was extremely lunatic then thus around Xormnuh(all laugh) and then if he was attacked Noctowl would’ve helped(all laugh) but if Musharna wasn’t connected to him only Heatran thus if he tried much his own Heatran might’ve sent him off to cosmic darkness(all laugh) a committee was formed of 20 Kommo-Os(all laugh) while 10 went to communicate(all laugh) each group communicated thrice(all laugh) 30 Kommo-Os fondled his nerves for 90 minutes(all laugh) and all those 30 yere full grown chosen brats(all laugh) and Heatran was 2.5 full hours with coffee(all laugh) went one full extra hour with untamed pokemon(all laugh) but everything was surpassed by Incineroar(all laugh) went there one day old Incineroar who would host him and with her to moderate was of all Lycanroc(all laugh) then spent may be 4 hours or 5(all laugh) and Incineroar of all pests took 4 months to become an utmost damn brat(all laugh)no wonder these brats are so happy here(all laugh)..they know him and the viseversa inside out(all laugh) and most unfortunately by him and own familiarity us too(all laugh) and now our kids as well..really I’m scared with that vulgarity(all laugh) just imagine the beauty will eventually come back home and is asked did you properly tickle like your parents do(all burst into laughter)..that will be enough for them to search for soulmates only(all laugh) by not searching(all laugh)..and if possible their soulmates will come and will be told mom and dad is busy bodyslamming(all burst into laughter) does yours do too how many illegal(all burst into laughter) and send you to mole here for more possibilites(all bruts into laughter)...that’s enough to give up pokemon career(all laugh)..so Kommo-O still pains you then don’t get one in this life or else I’ll kill that brat(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “neither they nor you like me(all laugh).......” Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “only I book my hubby(all burst into laughter)...” Seth(laugh) : “that’s why they are vulgarizing her life(all burst into laughter)...fine(all burst into laughter) the above statement says she’s old now so I’m not liking her bookings(all burst into laughter)...’never in a million years’(all burst into laughter)..so Trace gave a recation hearing this like am I inturding privacy in public(all laugh)..” Tracey(laugh) : “I thought how can an old couple look young(all burst into laughter) cause before me it was still ok as about life I never had that FEELING(all burst into laughter) of professionality(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “this brat Trace is now dancing to that master brat’s tunes else he never called me anything but Mr(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “and Mr(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “plus he has finally had that feeling on how can he devour the Daisyl(all laugh) unlike previously(all laugh)..plus his family was told how great he is and my family the opposite(all laugh)..this is schism(all laugh)..”Mehadi(same pose,smile) : “that feeling(all burst into laughter)..” Seth(laugh) : “of young flower dreaming(all burst into laughter)..... about Kommo-O being with me well utmost brat he would’ve become(all laugh)....,but I alos didn’t get Ultranercozma then(all laugh) well,Nercozma I tried this is the mega version as you know(all laugh) hence the enhanced pestering(all laugh) well Fennekin took 2 weeks to become Delphox..Ultranercozma I went to Ulstock,Unova(all laugh) but that place similarly had many Ultranercozmas who were too battle hungry(all laugh) and this was 4 months after Garchomp(all laugh) and this was their most dense populated area so I was extremely dissapointed(all laugh) then Kommo-O in penultimate month 2 more months later made me truly sad(all laugh) actually my Ultranercozma was away then(all laugh) and Kommo_O will be next term(all laugh) OR(all laugh)...Magmortgolem(all laugh) Dave says why don’t you spoil mine(all laugh) I said no your bunch won’t be spoiled so easily if not at all for that matter too ingrained in battle(all laugh) says but you were as crazy if not more not less for sure(all laugh) I said cause I couldn’t anticipate you can do anything it’s your blood mine was tranplanting(all laugh) said yeah Kommo-O rightly said life is hard(all laugh)...then I continued Unova is no good for this gym leader and Kalos as I said the culture would influence her badly even if from there itself and the variety of pokemons as well so yeah that’s for her gym leader life and skills but everywhere else just as good..here is why I am forcing Percy Kalos to preach my sweet Mehu flower’s name and telling Mehu to become more jovial(all laugh) then Kalos is tamed(all laugh) and for Unova well(all laugh) each dragon will say the homeland is full of substandard beaus(all laugh) cause the illegality is not allowed easily for parents by this to this age children(all burst into laughter) too idiotically demanding(all burst into laughter) and so on no my bunch is most vulgar(all laugh) but that makes them even more sweet cause thay themselves can’t breed at all(all laugh) all cause of how to get under the skin so that mind games are sharper(all laugh) but making Mehu jovial is impossible(all laugh) sees me or the ring and that’s it(all laugh)no you know I never criticized her before cause I was staying so far away from her I felt bad if she was hurt cause all I care about her skills is those so so cute frowns(all laugh) from my current position if I look back at myself at Johto Mehu was better than me abolutely if she was a trainer and actually in Pasio I was invincible really(all laugh) then my standard dropped cause that was sudden and I kinda lost that touch after first year at Johto I realized that it was about more practise and all but I understood it will take this league for sure and then if I think then first year at Hoenn her progress was more than me and that sudden thing surprized me cause I felt it was forced upon her cause she was better with that Gyarados may be but I felt like she won’t progress anymore as if that was it and I knew I will so I was curious about her and she was doing alright and it was more about her personality change that surprized me and then by Hoenn finals she could only have a 65-35 chance in group knockouts against me that too only if we were husband and wife(all laugh) else no chance and the reason wasn’t me but Tyranitar,Muk,Snorlax,Solgaleo,Sableye,Marshadow,Beeheeyem and all rest with Craudaunt and Glalie(all laugh) and still the rest(all laugh) and she has reached that potentital and hasn’t changed much I’ve gone way beyond imagination cause of TYRAniTAR(all laugh) and cause of my bunch and now you know about Magmortgolem and our 3 brats here(all laugh) that is a level atleast some of anyone’s bunch can reach atleast two will not one cause that bonhomie(all laugh) so then after Hoenn Mehu was all about the scowls(all laugh) and I just was beside her and all in terms of skills and no when I’m with her I don’t want that professional life to come anywhere near us cause it disturbs me to become Kommo-O(all laugh) and you know her(all laugh)..and Kommo-O against Mehu if she is in opposition now means I will myself scoff my bunch off cause I can’t stay like that with her in serious cases(all laugh) I could only manage once cause she was not my wife then officialy and the next day was spent with the picture which that day itself I bought and Lance said why the money I said please McShin isn’t ever funny(all laugh)..McShin now says like please mate let that off(all laugh) I say Stu you’re not helping yourself are you(all laugh) and then again forgets next moment like Jasu(all laugh)..mom never saw that picture cause it was in ghostly room(all laugh) and while I got in mom was kept busy by Mime and I just kept gazing at the picture and was saying Mehu I’ll be excruciatingly cruel on you on the date but you’re not going anyweher not being called Mehu Ketchum(all laugh)..and no really I was happy till the previous day night but then Gary called and said Mehadi has agreed to meet you but just as a personal advise you may know her psychophysical condition so don’t be too cruel just this no matter your intentions and I then wished him off(all laugh) but that was multiple edged cause first it meant Mehu may leave me this term before I finish my talks second again the insinuation that I don’t care about as much as her family does(all laugh) then thirdly and most brutally Gary of all people has become too infatuated no matter how delicate condition Lillie might be in still he should be able to manage his wife isn’t it his wife(all laugh) and it was insulting to me in a way cause I said mate I know how to trap your wife since I was born and messed up her wigs(all laugh) and you’re feiging(all laugh) then this made me first to kick Trace out of there jackals are strictly prohibited in open fields at night(all laugh) and then create false alarms and then Muk tried his best to get Professor out and I actually that day was blind totally at that moment and thought fair enough two generations will be shown the door(all laugh) and then Daisy being alone without the jackal meant jackal won’t try to fight me(all laugh) well jackal tried to fight me only once in his entire life by saying this isn’t your private area(all laugh) I insinuated that you only get a paycheque cause I am yet to set my brats upon your Scyther(all laugh),so jackal was down well Dave confronted me only once after getting in family that was at Kalos ofcourse(all laugh) then among the rest all are this and that rather fun and games but I have ever said there’s only one person whom I can’t judge personally or professionally THAT MAN..SAID,HEY!KETCHUM LET US PLAY!(all laugh)..that is unforgettable(all laugh) anyway then back to that day as Gary called me then suddenly all sorts of ideas came to me and I went prepared and knew the professor so told Sableye to hold you up in that position as much(all laugh) and leave Dr Oak Dr Oak cause he may catch you but Professor surely could in the lower levels but won’t say anything(all laugh) and he did of course cause had it been higher that day given my agitation you would’ve been hospitalized for a month may be(all laugh) and Gary tried to hit me after like 24 years(all laugh) got Gengared(all laugh) then I came out thinking this was good cause Mehu will be even more desperate and agitated to get the words lesser(all laugh) and then Mehu came up didn’t know else that would’ve been the first topic(all laugh) but she fed me the words womanising playboy(all laugh) I said yeah change the genders to complete the circle(all laugh) then was scowling and was so sweet(all laugh) then that was almost it then and then finally married her but return and never expected mom to be there(all laugh) then before that Mehu was saying that my sisters suffered due to me as much and then I realized what I did but I thought just leave it I’ll get the husbands trapped(all laugh) and no Brock was lulled into naivety(all laugh) and the jackal still called me getting my number from Daisy via Lillie via Gary(all laugh) that was only to confirm if it matched with last call(all laugh) then I was still jovial after telling Mehu of my adventures(all laugh) but then Daisy said don’t you still agree that you should’ve returned from Unova still even today(all laugh) then I realized what pain she was going through and Lillie as well in full cause I hurt two moms who were in deepest connection with their unborn babies and me being their bro-in-law were doing these(all laugh) but that was existentential the reality said Dase don’t cross me(all laugh),no I didn’t realize really that I had hurt my dearest sisters like that cause later came to know Zed had kept 2 brats here without my knowledge(all laugh) and told Gary about one and only who was visible that’s just Kimmie(all laugh) so when Daisy and Lillie was dragging THEIR SIS-IN-LAW AWAY(all laugh) I still thought Kimmie’s doseage must’ve made sure they are screwed up(all laugh) anyway so that goes later I was sad when Daisy said that so then I tell the crook that atleast I like Mehu(all laugh) then I start the beautiful hell(all laugh) which made sure that the end will send Daisy to the dayside for the rest of this term(all laugh) next time Daisy will play the gentle version while the jackal sentimentally chides all(all laugh) getting Scyther evolved(all laugh) and then that was done then my flower did the rest and Violet called later trying to eat me up(all laugh) so I patted my sensei on Mantine to Mantine(all laugh) and Violet being Brockolet took exactly 5 minutes to say naivety is viral(all laugh) at 7th I let her off cause was trying to appear via phone as realized the number(all laugh) so that was done crook of all people was saying who the hell do you think you’ve become and I was thinking man if I tell Chu to kill you he will inform you the first then attack me the second(all laugh) only if you have a gun or something and my bunch is there that can happen(all laugh) but the trouble is I won’t try to understand if that’s a real one or not unless I’m as much screwed up(all laugh) and no even if that does happen via existential uncertainty it’s only till we meet again no way can crook be left alone if I’m me(all laugh then smile,Brock says,yeah should’ve made sure of that first,all laugh),NAIVELY(all laugh) anyway so Brock was told that Kingler is here longest and she will kill me rather than to do anything to any of you cause she knows who you are individually as well now and I’m the brat(all laugh) so Gary and Trace were said the same thing before and as usual whole family realized that it’s reunion grandest time but the jackal tried to fox around(all laugh) didn’t turn out well of course(all laugh) anyway,so no matter Mehu’s level if my bunch doesn’t mingle with me I’ve ever been the lesser in professional life so seet to stay under deep water salty most times now though(laughs at Mehadi,Mehadi smiles at Seth too both same pose all else laugh) but my brats don’t like it(all laugh) and sadly her brats a few doesn’t either(all laugh) but the thing is that Mehu if she wants can be as good as me and jovial like this and all and since Hoenn her progress has been hindered cause Seth proposed his Mehu(all laugh)..fine(all laugh),so she could tame Tlplocus and all but if Xormnuh comes and asks her questions(all laugh) then she can tame it and will with her attitude as to me and not me like we’re same when both of us don’t want to battle we play but here I don’t at all yet you want to battle thus only hurting yourself none else and understand that me and you are same thus we’re same but I want to fondle my bunch or you like me which is great but this will not continue for long and after sometimes she is bored and then her answer is yeah this and that but Seth likes me(all laugh) so she didn’t progress cause cause now she is at a way higer level in battling except Unova(all laugh) and Unova is not cause it’s my Unova(all laugh) so yeah all my judgements I say are opinions of Kommo-O(all laugh) else Mehu is 7 league,6-1 absolutely any one league I take off cause Seth married me but he is in another region so mentally I will be there as well(all laugh) if we were doing contests we were absolutely May and Drew but here the draws are not liked(all laugh) but I could never play those mind games with my sweet flower more than once and if I did and won I would’ve married her immediately(all laugh) and all next league I’ll submit but I have sadly a brat named Feraligator(all laugh) but he would’ve been her buddy making sure she gets nuts so that I can fondle her even more(all laugh) but I criticize her cause she is playing old wife stuff(all laugh) thus making her bunch jovial is my burden now and thus 3 damn brats has come up(all laugh) so Mehu is ever like this and me and my bunch is same to her so her bunch has got an excuse to mingle with me(all laugh) and still Mehu serves everyone with her knowledge of dragons like Garchomp,Palkia,Noivern,Kyurem,Giratina,Ultranercozma,Latios,Hydreigon and so on(all laugh) all has been here but these brats more especially Garchomp cause he was alone(all laugh) and hence beaked everyone off with reflection mastery(all laugh) but Mehu is so happy now why so Mehu flower(all laugh,all laugh)..” Mehadi(same pose,smile) : “cause my bee is totally under my command(all laugh) that is I can bodyslam him as much as I want as Mehu not Mehadi(all laugh)..” Seth(same pose,laugh) : “so she is too sweetened now to understand that she is a gym leader(all laugh)..doesn’t want to and thus just goes and comes around always with pokemons and now she is if she wants so can be absolutely my equal cause she knows me and my methods inside out that skill of battling is her own accumulated knowledge but the soul is with Seth so the things Seth knows is the real knowledge thus the two mixed will get her to handle my bunch as well as me and she knows them as well but the problem is Seth means only Seth so any thought after that stops(all laugh) Seth actually has harmed her career progress(all laugh)..so she can beat any dragon or go there and tame a dragon but that is not Kommo-O agreed(all laugh) and hence I say she hasn’t progressed cause if both our bunchs were same we would’ve created a monopoly in the pokemon world(all laugh) and if she was a trainer it would’ve happened(all laugh) and you know her actual level is as good as Dave atleast as he says after each match(all laugh) Dave says really bro your judgement on all is too harsh I say Dave Kommo-O told me life is hard(all laugh) no really when I was normal(all laugh) I was just like anyone nothing special may be 23 time champ or max 4 no more but since Corpish and Snorant became Crawdaunt and Glalie(all laugh) Glalie was a bit shaky for a long time which she got out of only after being at the gym relaxed too much(all laugh) and if Golduck gets that he will get totally spoiled like Magmortgolem thus he doesn’t(all laugh) and infact himself in a way just loves Mehu as this form more than the jovial form(all laugh) which of course is against Kyogre dictionary(all laugh) Gyarados understands Golduck’s concerns more cause her beau likes him too much(all laugh) and Jellicent was most ardent follower of none other than Gengleye(all laugh) so can’t think(all laugh) Kyogre atleast can think(all laugh) as he sadly had Noivern(all burst into laughter) and then had Greninja(all laugh) so the lecturing hasn’t manifested outwardly thus too cunning(all laugh) but Glalie if in mood was a damn brat(all laugh) and Crawdaunt was Crawdaunt so then I realized these brats means more so understood now I atleast have Muk,Charizard,Solgaleo,Tyranitar,Marshadow,Sableye,Snorlax,Metagross,Buzzwole,Emboar,Sh arpedo,Meowstic,Whimsicott and these two all very special thus 15 and I need 10(all laugh) so then it was upto me but then came out that Bayleaf,Delphox,Heracross,Typhlosion,Floatzel,Kingler,Sceptile herself(all laugh) and so on were damn brats as well(all laugh) but these doesn’t include Feraligator cause he was choosy if he didn’t like it on the day or the challenger he won’t bother(all laugh) that is an in-born brat(all laugh) and Crawdaunt was incessant as that dark type was but he was nasty and tried to disobey all time and lull challengers to follow him(al laugh) his thing was he must use his distributed brain to recombine all combinations in permutations(all laugh) and Snorlax was if he gets his way only then that is he will fool around only(all laugh) and Muk is better not discussed(all laugh) and so on each had their own moods(all laugh) but Mehu flower had such pokemons but she might become jovial as well but different nature means different behaviour so not like mine but exactly like Kyogre,Jellicent and Gyarados now the art of challenger lulling(all laugh) but Mehu flower doesn’t like it cause she will play big sister and say life is such and all then as the official hours finish will eat her Seth up(all laugh) so Mehu revolts against progressing to joviality(alllaugh)..,and she knows everything about everything I do now(all laugh) but still if I say why don’t you do more anatomy(all laugh),’21 years too much hum(all laugh)’ my sweet Mehu flower during marriage said you too cheated upon me,’shut up you’re only Seth(all laugh)’,then I said I have cheated now back cause that didn’t go well,’stop you namecall only mine you are(all laugh)’,then I finally said you rejected me to cheat upon me(all laugh),’Seth why don’t you like me(all laugh)’,I realized that she is totally blind and thus never knew where she was since 16(all laugh) if not 6(all laugh) then Daisy told me that night she is too devoted ever don’t hurt her she will follow your finger movements I was thinking yeah like the jackal(all laugh) atleast you are allowing the jackal or the crook or Gary to be firm with you for 30 seconds(all laugh) but my flower will catch cold if I call her Mehadi even once in a serious conversation by mistake(all laugh) today itself I for once said yeah Mehadi(all laugh)..,she won’t say anything then but after it has finished will say,’right but all is ok cause I’m Mehadi(all laugh)’ then it means I called her Mehadi..so I have to fondle Mehu flower again..she has to boss me around like that that whatever she does I will like her(all laugh) and then if she is scolded for doing too much to be in attention(all laugh) she will catch cold cause Seth doesn’t like me(all laugh) then whole time I must be there and that is Mehu flower’s motto of life Seth should like me(all laugh) and my method of making a firm statement is to sweeten her up too much(all laugh) so herself realizes that yeah Seth likes me so lets see if he is right or not then if not right she will say beause she is old now I don’t cherish her as much(all laugh) then I myself have to find out her reason of disagreement and then sort it out while she will be at negetive circles(all laugh) toffee-flower(all laugh)..then I continued that,so that is there as full of her career assesment and for your parts it was from 3rd Hoenn,Sinnoh,Pasio or Pasio,Hoenn,Sinnoh or Pasio,Sinnoh,Hoenn(all laugh) then if first then Sinnoh and Pasio and second Pasio or Hoenn and Sinnoh and 3rd Pasio or Sinnoh and Hoenn(all laugh) so yeah the 3rd league is definitely and one before that too but Kalos was the wrong K should’ve been Kanto(all laugh) but if Kalos was tried in the illusion as Kanto was then again might’ve had a good progess atleast Salamences would’nt have been this dangerous but Darkrai,Deoxys,Zeraora,Zygarde,etc could’ve(all laugh) and you still would’ve won Kanto in your current histories if Kanto was tried in place of Kalos as Johto,Kanto Frontier,Sinnoh and Hoenn was done Kanto should’ve been infact tried to proceed further in illusion against me(all laugh) cause that would’ve been won as that last part which did get that would’ve fuelled this cause I never won Kanto my Volcarona did(all laugh) and my Sinnoh trophy would’ve been negated(all laugh) with Hoenn already been there and Pasio would’ve been won after that so by the end of that and when I was being promiscus(all burst into laughter) would’ve made sure I’m only Frontier up(all laugh)..as I say this I saw that men were totally baffled(all laugh) that I was planning like them(all laugh) so I continued the honestly dishonest hallucinations of VEILING my relations with my flower(all laugh)..so yeah that would’ve only made the illusion stronger though(all laugh)...and then her skills are perfect to fetch Kanto exactly lacking what I never got it then and yeah Cobalion would’ve come too(all laugh) but again if Kalos was last in place of Kanto then I’m very sorry but no matter the fuel upto max and no matter how good the bunches are and yeah max even upto last 16 may be and no with much much less fear but title no chance with Heatran,Zeraora,Darkrai,Malamar,Salamence but also innumerable in numbers there at border are Zygarde(all burst into laughter) hence you can’t get any cause you can see one which is a bunch and the viseversa mentally thought(all burst into laughter),and those places are where many gyms are as well that are must for 2+(all burst into laughter) and the order is Cobalion,Groudon,Xerneas,Heatran,Zygarde(all laugh) and the reason why Kalos is afraid of Unova is Zygarde(all laugh) cause Zygarde life dictates that if anyone is around me he is here to give me a feeling that I must protest even if dead(all burst into laughter) so to tame them you must make them understand you will help them in protesting cause you yourself protest against your own bunch being around you and the viseversa(all burst into laughter) so you go there and let your bunch infight to confuse them(all laugh) then when they come in you join in infighting againt your own Cobalion(all burst into laughter) he can’t hit you so will go to psychic level where you tell him you don’t like him(all burst into laughter) then he will be sad thus Zygarde will be interested in you(all laugh) then will surround you alone(all laugh) one will come to you to ask for your health(all laugh) you tell them health itself is a hazard as an idea cause when we’re sick wethink about it when healthy then too so just the constant idea isn’t it(all burst into laughter) why so much infatuation(all burst into laughter) thus Zygarde will realize you’re a wise Zygarde so will try to make you wiser(all burst into laughter) thus will come to you but before that your Cobalion must engage with you again and again and so on(all burst into laughter)..they said,yeah our Cobalion is great but it’s not a Gengar(all burst into laughter) I said yeah that idea(all burst into laughter) and then I said,because of all these dragons and your disliking of dragons cause of the taste of life is different to you than that of dragon it’s the ideological difference of expression of happiness that is(all burst into laughter) thus for Unova I’m sorry but again too tough a place though could’ve been toured very well with a few Dragonites and Garchomps(all laugh) and certainly a Noivern too(all burst into laughter) if you didn’t already have one from Kalos(all burst into laughter) so overall you see
may be the 4th if not illusion but hard so 3 leagues are amusing by all means if not 4 though I realize that 2 league is one category 3 is another then 4 and 5 is another then the either hall of fame or not that part are another two so yeah in that sclae 2nd level out of 5 not bad at all cause first it’s not the first level of 2 league champ(all laugh) and then that’s just career after that we live for atleast say 40 more years minimum which is lived out in great comfort if just have completed 6 regions getting out of the group knockouts to advanced knockouts 4 times among them(all laugh) so what to speak of 3 time champs and yeah 4 and 5 is better but in terms of money only and the next two are rather depressive at times for many cause of the hazards and especially the topmost one while the next best has that insatiation again(all laugh) but 5 time champs as well have that feeling of one more and you yourselves have bestowed that inevitability on one(all burst into laughter) so you realize it can be hard unless properly understood so yeah just the 4 time all wants and 3 is next best so perfect life don’t you agree(all laugh) said,yeah well financially absolutely true more comfortable is 4(all laugh) but so is 3 than 2(all laugh) just than unhappiness chain that is(all burst into laughter) and the soulmates are 1 time conference that too Pasio(all laugh) so the gross is most excellent(all laugh) I said,well marriage confirmed then said,yeah at once confessed the whole thing cause of our age(all burst into laughter) I said yeah very nice best wishes then and the future said,well for the future we’re recoreding this full talk(all burst into laughter) as we said we would(all burst into laughter) I said,yeah I understood that and that’s why the consent but I hope that the previous generation doesn’t foist the Gengar to the next(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) said,no just for the important Salamence and Palkia and Zygarde too(all laugh) and the combinational parts the rest will be not noted down and deleted(all burst into laughter) I said well all of them has recorded their share too(all burst into laughter) said yeah as they should be cause other people and all has great views but those are serious and mechanical for an enjoyable experience(all burst into laughter) I said,well I’m ever honoured for the fact that because my bunch can’t communicate in our language..we know hopefully(all burst into laughter)..so I get to give their views including mine to the world cause we like this world that we’re part of as it’s funny in a very enjoyable way(all laugh and .) hence our endeavours to pay homage(all laugh) said yeah we understand that but what about your own assesment I said well about my own situation she helped me in Johto the most I would’ve been out in round 32 itself unless she was present there and during Johto was much better than me and if went to Hoenn and so on I already said but without her it would’ve been if the same route was followed then the same result except a hard awakening in Johto cause I was overconfident in finals which she removed there(all laugh)...by shifting that overconfidence towards her that AH!OH Mehadi!MY Mehadi!..logically that is(all burst into laughter..,Seth and Mehadi un.. ..)..,no really Daisy poured water cold on my plans of getting her propose me behind closed doors at my own room while doors would’ve been closed by my mom herself or even dad(all burst into lughtaer)...” Daisy(laugh) : “thus the revenge now(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “to make you happy(all burst into laughter),countering(all laugh).....,no really the door would’ve been closed anyway cause I would’ve told mom that I’m waiting for her confess for a change(all laugh) and thus she herself would’ve made the arrangements isn’t that nice(all burst into laughter) or if dad same thing cause I already was a multiple time champ atleast not infatuation(all laugh) know both my dad and dad-in-law would’ve done the same to both of us but my gym leader mom would’ve been suspicious(all laugh) till she heard two words(all burst into laughter) it would’ve been something else really but Daisy wouldn’t have had her ways so easily out of gym battling abruptly(all laugh) but still my dream was really to say mom please don’t disturb me Mehu will propose me officially to get married(all laugh) losing the self being no more Seth in the Mehu(all laugh,Seth and Mehadi smiles at each other than same pose both)/looking to Gary through wigs to get the Lil in gist(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs and in tears laughing,Gary laughs shaking his head)/rocking as Brock to elude the Viol flower then the fist(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Violet in fits of laughter and tears laughing,Brock shakes his head laughing)/finally realizing Tracey means fight to hold the Dase by wrist(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Tracey shakes in head laughing,Daisy in fits of laughter and tears laughing)...the art of planting the grass(all uncontrollably laugh,tears).....,so how’s the other reviews(all burst into laughter)..” Violet(laugh) : “you are going to be my partner in script writing and doing the show all yourself with a few imported and chosen Kommo-O (all laugh)..” Daisy(laugh) : “this brat after 23 years is in full retirement to pester the whole world now as revenge(all laugh) and he gets the leeway cause his flower is absolutely Gyaradosy to absolute beyond(all laugh)” Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “take that you namecalls he only praised me(all laugh)..” Lillie(laugh) : “cause he namecalled you the most before(all laugh)...man this is something really(all laugh)...”
Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “to namecall you again if you don’t like me(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “as my former Ms Mehadi Waterflower(all burst into laughter)..so what are the soulmates saying” Gary(laugh) : “two words(all burst into laughter)..” Brock(laugh) : “atleast the jackal got the benefit of licking his boots(all laugh) and Dr Oak Dr Oak for meeting each of his deamands(all laugh) but first this brat dragged me through the world for 12 years taking me AWAY from my flower(all laugh) and then himself namecalled me then humilated my moments in front of family(all laugh)..I’ll dose your brats off(all laugh)..” Tracey(all laugh) : “still the jackal was fox enough on both occasions to not be present PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “BANETTE(all burst into laughter) ayway,then I continued that yeah except Johto rest same but with the possibility that my bunch again would’ve turned on like they are now right after Hoenn(all laugh) or atmost Frontier wouldn’t have waited till Sinnoh(all laugh) and at worst Johto itself making the situation impossibly more jovial cause then I was 21(all burst into laughter) but she would’ve won against me only if she faced me at the group knockouts with 65- 35 in my favour(all laugh) after that none could(all laugh) and if she was a stranger or both didn’t have the mutual feeling that we had while we were in our relationship then absolutely no chance(all laugh) first 4 rounds if I was assured that I wanted to marry her right after the match and then immediately settle down have a family then she would’ve won(all laugh) with 65-35 chance in my favour(all laugh) but even then I could’ve atmost married her and bought a house or or something but by then my bunch would’ve turned on me(all laugh) so next two leagues anyway thus I would’ve been a three time champ for sure(all laugh) but you realize with that bunch one title is enough to get to the same place that I’m at now(all laugh) then men became compassionate(all laugh) said,yeah we guess so but you really have been very hurt being away from her so long(all burst into laughter) but we’re just curious as to say we saw her as much hurt(all laugh) and this during your break-up(all laugh) so yeah the middle years were hard(all laugh) but did you two never contacted even just after your undercover(all laugh) cause we know she was asked once and said Crawdauntogator was so sweet(all laugh) and said they still like me(all burst into laughter) so thinking I said,no I did once before undercover(all laugh) was gym battling and that was it said,we see 5 years were rueing that mistake of being gym leader(all laugh) and we know about the Johto parting would’ve never left you would she(all laugh),I said,no I don’t think so until she was married to me no(all laugh) but that’s not what it is so why don’t I continue the assesment(all laugh),said yeah sure just the idea she is a very strange creature cause all it needed was to tell us that she was forcefully living life of a self inflicted widowhood chiding the husband away(all laugh) forgot the word only(all laugh) so yeah lets continue...I thought yeah like all of us were(all laugh) the Daisyl is a master at this(all burst into laughter,Daisy laughs shaking her head) the jackal understands three words about relationship.sin,spouse,widow(all laugh) so he reciprocated by the days most(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) the crook was playing that much to Violet’s dismay cause she thought that’s not properly played by men that too who forgets not to call at tea(all laugh) and then Dr Oak Dr Oak and Lillie were choosing the right colour of the wig while they forgot they were at reservation(all burst into laughter) and I thought 3 weeks for marriage registration wasn’t enough so later made it in 3 days(all laugh)....,no really that word I’ll ever remember Kommo-O said life is hard(all laugh) anyway then I said,well she wasn’t married so that word didn’t occur to her like that thus the trouble(all laugh) so anyway then and if I was a gym leader at Cerulean(all burst into laughter) say the youngest brother than the youngest sister then I would’ve wanted to go to Unova once in the middle(all laugh) then only return again no matter what the great leads said(all laugh) cause Daisy Waterflower was as good as the current one is once and the span was little cause her ambitions and all wasn’t like that she had many talents so just one would’nt appease great talents the current one has got the starship brand(all laugh)..fine(all burst into laughter),got that starship brand due to the work done by all the 3 elder sisters and the gym leading part only is her own but yeah Daisy helped her in initial days VIA the gentleman(all burst into laughter) who is a brilliant observer(all burst into laughter,Tracey laughs shaking his head,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) thus the pokemons were looked after very well and that steady calm getleness(all laugh) made the current leader responsible enough cause we all know the previous version(all laugh)..so thus is the reality there but she she went in shows I would’ve fled to Unova(all laugh) for 2 years cause Daisy at that moment should’ve been forced to battle more(all laugh) thus after Unova I’d got a few Palkia and Kyurem and the hall of fame process would’ve been there in this year only rather than the last cause my philosophy in gym battling is to let everyone have their ways thus being too cunning(all laugh) so the outside doesn’t pester and the right ones come to have a good day like this(all burst into laughter) but yeah even there my bunch could’ve got spoiled(all laugh) far earlier(All laugh) then the gym would’ve been rather a joviality conference(all laugh) with even fire types and all(all laugh) that would mean that the gym is a hoilday destination for many like Pasio in a nutshell giving a humungus sum to feast upon(all burst into laughter,.) the badge is obviously Responsibility badge(all burst into laughter) for first quarter of a year(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tear) where my bunch would responsibly show how not to be so(all burst into laughter) cause that’s only volunteering to jump into fire involving the psychophysical ideas rather than pure heartfelt ones without them always as they are(all laugh),second quarter is Competence Badge to show the only way to be competent is to not be so(all burst into laughter) cause as a little deep thinking tells us that there’s no such thing as present(all laugh),thus one shouldn’t think past or future(all burst into laughter) cause the past has got them upto the present which is now past and the next moment now was the future from the 2nd previous moment(all burst into laughter) and thus the only way to way is to not be bother about time but the the mental and philosophical progress observed day by day(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs in tears,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs as well) which is self introspection thus where is the second to compete with(all burst into laughter,.) this was one then 3rd quarter is Rationality Badge(all burst into laughter) as my bunch will show that if you are different from your master cause your master wants to battle you don’t(all laugh) as that word isn’t meaningful to them so thus be rational leave thy master cause he’s a pain unto your sanity(all burst into laughter) see we want to play and our master allows that so come to us and they would’ve followed suit later fondling their own masters this is the rationality that the trainer and his bunch is different from each other thus the trust is mutual ever one shouldn’t foist there ideas upon another and pokemons can’t do that thus the responsibility is the trainer’s to be rational on himself thus all follows(all burst into laughter .) to call at lunch(all laugh) then the 4th quarter is the Professionality Badge(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) where my bunch will show that be professional by being not serious(all burst into laughter) why think about the goal or the actions the steps to go there cause they will not be never be enough to satisfy the feeling of hunger so focus on that professionally and find out that that hunger can be satisfied only if it is known that to live one doesn’t need anything except food and safe shelter thus if that’s the need the rest is all a polish to get that so why not we remove the polish and do only that that is the life of say a pokemon that can’t breed eat sleep wake-up repeat(all burst into laughter) but then once this is understood it will be seen that being humans we can’t do that thus we need something more as a food-social food,intellectual food,emotional food,spiritual food,philosophical food,experiential food,congnitive food and so on(all laugh) which being so many can only be satisfied by that one dish which will have all this included in abundance and where this can be found is to be reflected upon(all laugh) now in the world things vary thus that food will not be possible to get but in the mind where this hunger is generated like in body where gross food and so on is generated is telling us to search for food outside yet in each moment the same mind is telling us that that all encompassing dish(all laugh,Brock laughs .ly) is not available outside at all cause no matter what this hunger for that food will ever inrease if I never lost a match I would want each to finish in one minute(all laugh) and so on thus it will be shown that being born is a curse cause one is agitated with psychophysical ideas like say Ultranercozma 5 type advantage why not all in one(all burst into laughter) then if all at what proportion(all laugh) if all how does it feel not not have even one(all burst into laughter) and so on thus the only way to be happy(All laugh) is to try to be happy by trying to be so(all burst into laughter) the same self introspection should be continued with the idea that whatever is enticing at this moment try to do that honestly and with focus and be prefect in that as much as possible thus each moment the joy that is generated of a perfect that is local and not that global elusive one is enough to give that total dish(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) so the whole life becomes ethically honest in due morality of honesty inbibed in ethics(all laugh) and that is happy life which is found inside one rather than outside of one thus to be professional the way is to rather than being an individual who is personally professional to the world be the world in whole and then be professionally personal to get that individual that you are from that world(all laugh and .) counter the natural way of thinking thus an alternative is found and thus the alternative to that being the natural way is more sharpened thus one would know the idea of peronally professional and professionaly personal(all burst into laughter and .) if mixed together all is negated each feeling giving the joy of a little baby that doesn’t know anything but this time the joy is after knowing everything thus where is seriousness and professionality of personality(all laugh and .) only an honest individual remains who is happy by being so(all laugh) this is as you know is learnt from the a great professional that is Dr Oak Dr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary laughs shaking his head,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) so he agrees with this and for me that is big cause he ever has agreed with to the beings who are propagating this idea that is my bunch(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) and yeah I did say there too that it is because Dr Oak Dr Oak agrees(all laugh) as of that type(all laugh)..but also please point out the number of edges and direction of propagation and reciprocate Mrs Oak that this is AH!NOT DR OAK BUT MR OAK!(all burst into laughter)..and Mrs Slate please point out the number and types of food that is required at which time and reciprocate please as AH!LUNCH BREAK NOT TEA BREAK!(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..” Lillie(laugh) : “my lion now with foods and directions will be in serious mess(all laugh)..AH! MAGMORTER!GOLEM!(all laugh)..” Violet(laugh) : “and with foods and timings of breaks(all laugh),it’s all just so naive(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “this is vengeance(all laugh)..” Gary(laugh) : “still atleast you had your time to invoke that feeling I’ve never had that either(all laugh)..”
Seth(laugh) : “TYRAniTAR(all laugh)...so anyway,then I say,so is this for an idea men were in another world(all laugh) they say,amusing amusing the perfect way to teach whole life in one match as to it helps in all walks of life and 4 stages are also like eat sleep wake-up repeat(all burst into laughter) eat those foods(all laugh) sleep in self reflection wake-up with new idea or realization repeat the process Gengars are like that(all burst into laughter) eat roam around come back to eat again repeat(all laugh) great great I said,yeah philosophically may be may be even pokemons can demonstrate it to then self analyze the rest but at the end of the day it’s the bottom line(all burst into laughter) cause else neither me not my bunch can continue our job and so this four badges is all cause that’s the contradiction to drive even more tourists in while keepning the most challengers out cause that word is useless(all laugh and .) so a win-win reallyisn’t it(all laugh and .) said,yeah brilliant plan to Gengar the whole life on top of money(all laugh) and then to use the money everywhere needed cause a Gengar doesn’t need any comfort cause it doesn’t understand what it means(all burst into laughter,.) and yeah we a group from office went to a few matches here in your Elite4 tour(all laugh) and we hear that the black market was hot(all laugh) and we were given comfortable positions due to the position to watch and have fun and that was fun cause none knew why your bunch was so happy(all laugh) and the opposition was wiliting like that despite just plays(all laugh) the sum that was forced by you to be shared with you(all laugh) which later went to multiple places even in Pasio some of which we ourselves signed and passed(all burst into laughter) and so on and all were to places where exactly the heads don’t want them to go cause of the ego clashes only(all laugh) so this idea of a Gengar(all laugh) has really struck us that all fears Gengar all loaths Gengar all are irritated by Gengars and yet when sad Gengars are making people happy and then overall a Gengar is too intigruing a creature to mingle with much but yet when chance comes one would be entertained and taught thing both beyond imaginations(all laugh) I said yeah pretty only if a real Gengar is consulted or can be kept patient that long for that matter(all laugh) but about the money well that is what it is cause it’s just someone’s money is going to someone to make the later happier the former the opposite(All laugh) we all know so using the situation I could burgain only(all laugh) but yeah about the gyms making money surely the similar situation with money and we all after 23 years of crwaling around the whole world(all laugh) want peace and happy personal life and that’s all and as we know our situations financially allows that so so happy for that bit but what will the future learn(all burst into laughter) said,just be not serious about things that make you serious like life and death(all laugh and .) rest is about being too happy to be honest and so on then just go about I said yeah that’s everyone would like and I’m happy so much that if my bunch and thus me could help people and so on(all laugh) then they said,yeah we’re so happy for this meeting as well(all laugh) but about the combinations of regions you were giving according to general ideas we guess contests are similar given your experiences there(all laugh) I said yeah pretty much my second female travel companion is now married Mrs May Maple Blackmore you might know about her more given your halving procedures(all laugh) said yeah she is famous rather for drawing 4 straight with her now husband Mr Drew Blackmore and definitely too famous for her style of relentless attacking in 5 minutes(all laugh) and then in last four final rounds in finals 8(all laugh) and her husband being the exact opposite(all laugh) who was ever best pointer I 1st round to her who ever was the last to qualify(all laugh) then the exact opposite in 2nd round where Mr Spew Blackmore(all laugh) ever looked at bay with too much shrewdness and Mrs May Maple Blackmore ever looked too lunatic to not jump upon the whole crowd and judges by jumping her hubby(all laugh) and both would’ve got atleast another conference but they may be had had some serious personal or family issues and thus now setteled down and so on but the whole general trainer’s world knows your shared ribbon with her(all laugh) and the whole conference world knows that her style was directly influence by having to compete with you for 4 years(all laugh) for which she is too happy and wants to beat you so much(all laugh) and her husband ever thoughtfull(all laugh) cause that got him out of his too calculative approach of spewing(all laugh) and he got the draws in finals but the whole conference world knows the duo for their inter spouse skirmishes everywhere(all laugh) which were so funny to all(all laugh) and they so innocently after each time said just emotions(all laugh) I said yeah May and Drew is like that ever too simple and sweet and their bond has been like that for 15 years now(all laugh) and so happy I’m that they are married and all having a good life and professionally so great but I know that you must win 5 out of 7 and in grand conferences to face their leaders then get them 4 in 7 to get hall of fame there and so on they don’t have the Frontier system but for that reason and the travelling in regions being 1 month rather than two the specific time is 1.5 year less(all laugh) we at 16 years within first 6 months atmost till our 40th birth month and they 38.5th birth month and then you can start only upto 19.75 and never 20(all laugh) and in general you get exactly 25 years and a month from your birth month to travel the whole world getting wild brats to make them listen to you for 6 hours while having their ways with you for the rest 18(all laugh) so that you may make a living after 40 if you’re alive after 20 that is(all laugh) so you must finish within 43 and 9th birth month else you’re not getting general trainers tag even(all laugh) delicious isn’t it these rules and life(all laugh) they said yeah maddening life cause of such sweetening rules and incessant wild damn brats(all laugh) then isaid,hence my brats so sweetly and incessantly dance to that maddening tune(all laugh),but in the legendary ranks where do the duo situates cause they suddenly pulled out when they were just 28 having 11 more years left to complete there career,which Shrew is venturing forth from next(all laugh),yeah told me yesterday man this torture for 1.5 years too much(all laugh) I said what does your rose say(all laugh),yeah not allowed to enter home unless gets Unovan Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..no he will go to Kalos actually(all laugh) I told him don’t do Unova(all laugh) cause in Kalos still gets Haxorus,Tryruntum,Zygarde,Noivern and Salamence(all laugh)..Salamncian philosophy(all laugh)..mega Salamencian food(all laugh)..man that day was really best comedy ever seen(all laugh) he actually wants the 4th to rev up the CV there(all laugh) will get it closed eyes cause said will live here for 4 months before(all laugh,cheers for VOMIT,all burst into laughter) yeah,sweet sweet spew will have a memorable time here as usual as mad vomit cleaner(all laugh) and he said man can’t I do both Kalos and Unova(all laugh) then I said well why don’t you do Unova and your sweet rose do Kalos,after all my sis should study at Venturiastrog as well to get her daughters educated shouldn’t she(all laugh) so yeah why not I’ll have to go to Unova atleast once more and total say 6 years so yeah why not Mehu hasn’t travelled Kalos,Trace has some unfinished businesses left there(all laugh) and Dr Oak Dr Oak never has travelled with me I want my sweet sweet twin with me(all laugh) so he will have to be at Unova of all places of course(all laugh) no actually both May and Drew wanted to do finish their careers but Pasio was so bad experience for them had to quit it and now is happy but you know with the sweet dolls now having grown up a bit both their mom and dad is again getting reddened to battle(all laugh),mom won’t though ONLY NOW AT PRESENT(all laugh) but dad is too desperate for a change(all laugh) mom was saying,yeah old age this reinvigoration was inevitable(all laugh) I said May,you are of same age(all laugh),WAY YOUNGER THAN 1 FULL DAY(all laugh) I said yeah,just this age(all laugh) no really you all know Unova wants me in every step(all laugh) and Kalos yeah the magazines(all laugh) and my brats are too impatient as well(all laugh),so I will actually do 39 to 41 of Unova of all regions ofcourse(all laugh) and then Mehu,Trace and Dr Oak Dr Oak will do 4 months as they are too desperate as well especially my sweet Mehu flower(all laugh) she will do 8 in two regions(all laugh) as will Trace and Gary against any kind of own wishes(all laugh) then the rest is many has BOOKED me(all laugh) all wants a bit of me(all laugh),so many people will be there and strangely this includes Percy of all people(all laugh) said no man me and Mrak will join you at Huntelin dinner for sure(all laugh) so they will have to be appeased and then then there are many more(all laugh) and Dave yeah that’s default ain’t it(all laugh) and Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Cili is a must at Huntelion(all laugh)..I’ll do Unova from 39 to 41 then if only I can will do Kalos from 42 to 44 till last month and from 45th birth month my cap will be hung for good for this term(all laugh) or 42 which I think it will be 45 will be too hard(all laugh) but no really you know I do have two regions left for me(all laugh) if not another Unova absolutely for sure(all laugh) and well it will depend on many things including Riuminan revolution most(all laugh) but just wish I could do that once more AH!that maddening tune!(all laugh) Dave says similar stuffs as well you know(all laugh) no bro one more region atleast whose who’se beau bring each brat together(all laugh),Doctor Slate is the only one that doesn’t want to travel even
Violet wants to go to Kalos(all laugh) and Lillie both Kalos and Unova and Daisy only Unova of all places(all laugh) you all will be there for 1 month atleast for sure but may be atmost too(all laugh),but we all want to travel once more why the exceptional feeling Doctor Slate(all laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “man,enough with your insanity for 13 years(all laugh) even your own wife fled after 7(all laugh) which is um..(all burst into laughter)” Mehadi(irritated,same pose,Seth laughs a lot same pose) : “far better than sneaking into Yellowburst WAITING PATIENTLY(all burst into laughter)..um..(all burst into laughter)..SHUT UP!(all laugh)..my sweet Seth is my sweet projection and I’ll do whatever I want with my sweetie(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “too sweetie(all laugh,Seth smiles at Mehadi who smiles at him in same pose),anyway,then back to beauty(all laugh),so then I said well I know that they only pulled out due to the fact that pests were at them only cause the pests couldn’t draw 3 contest finals but never for not reaching them though(all laugh) as much as I know, said,well we guess just the fact that had any lost the 2nd final his or her chance of hall of fame no more so they drew but then continued the travel companionship means they never cared about names and so oneven then the general sentiment is that they are as good as hall of fames and you may know conferences aren’t as obsessive as ours never to recogize anyone as legend who hasn’t got in hall of fame(all laugh) except a very few rare cases who still are forced into honourary hall of fame(all laugh) and under that light surely they are world famous names and household names if legend can’t be used to term them for formalitie’s sake but what about your personal realtions with them(all laugh) I said,well May just was my little sister in the first two of her regions Hoenn and Kanto and in Kanto she took that as 1.5 years the next 2.5 making life even harder for her(all laugh) and all cause wanted to travel one more region with me and the nice things about her style that I saw myself to develop from zero and well she may now say that battling me all time helped but it was rather the big bro little sis skirmishes(all laugh) she developed that style by herself I was just there and we’ve had that bond of brother and sister and truly are so but she now is a grown up lady married and all(all laugh) so that bond is rather free of the little sis big bro emotioanl tug-of-war stuff now and thus more mentally ideological than verbally communicational(all burst into laughter,.) and she is too good at her game as you see and yeah Drew I know as long as May and he is extremely as good as her as you can see as well so yeah say if you go to Hoenn then same if Pasio then send them to Kanto definitely nowhere else including Pasio absolutely(All laugh) cause both of you MIGHT intrude being too CARING(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs)..anyway they said,well thanks much but it depends on personalities too I said,definitely all general approach but Kanto is most you can say modest culture(all laugh) with Johto almost similar and Hoenn just a little open and Pasio,Kalos and Sinnoh you know(all laugh) said yeah Pasio and Sinnoh and Salamence nests(all laugh) but here we would like to have your assesment of their styles(all laugh),I said yeah burden falls(all laugh) then said well May at first was too insecured she ever has an extremely stubborn and determined core which is why she is what she is in her career but at the same time is extremely sweet and simple which at that age 16.5 was clashing and hence was insecured but later as time passed became very very self established and extremely determined all the while her sweetness only increased and her style thus is the incessant attacking while forgetting the opponent cause that’s the determination that I will get my way no matter what the one that is appearing to me at this moment and thus she prepares a plan in general looking at the opponent before the start then just gets in and continuously only modifies that plan after each of her own steps and looking at the reaction that is she doesn’t try to predict but tries to enlarge the existing plan to infinite while the gym leader sets up a plan as usual like May both are not much intellectual(all laugh) just intuition and very ardent listeners doesn’t foist own opinions unless well tested to themselves thus has the grand base to make predictions and May’s education yeah has been as usual Doctor Slate while he was doing his classes at college(all laugh) DIANCIE(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) then yeah Dr Oak Dr Oak and Dr Muk is Foxing Skechit is as you see indespensible to insanity(all laugh) and also May is an ardent disciple of the great Professor Birch whom whole world knows(all laugh) then also knows innumerable people including Cerulean City gym leader(all laugh) then uncle that is Mr Norman Maple I still call him uncle is also hall of fame where you very marginally lost to Pyroar during Hoenn with your Salazzle I know(all laugh) they said,yeah we forgot thanks(all laugh) then I said,yeah so he as well you see is a great name and so on so May have had her basic works done there then the different between her and the gym leader is that she is more reddened(all laugh) thus impatient(all laugh) you can’t beat her in a 5 minute sprint if you’re in contests cause you’re not the one that can(all laugh) cause it’s only her(all laugh) and in 8 minutes she can be beaten but only very very high category trainers can none from contests can(all laugh) but the gym leader wants to run longer so with time she grows in confidence her method is reading the mind of the opponent whereas May’s method is doing so of own(all laugh) that is the basic difference between the two hence the former is grand in anticipations and the later in modifications(all laugh) so May actually can shut herself out from the whole world while on the patform hence she is only against herself as would’ve any of my brats Spiritomb,Shiftree,Feraligator etc most yeah(all laugh) so my sis is similar against herself in a way not the opponent thus those who don’t know her core can’t do much exactly why only he who knows does cause he’s she(all laugh) and then the gym leader shuts out the ideas of the battle off from herself that is she shuts herself out of the surroundings of everything it’s only her own mind that reads the opponent pokemons mind nothing else is there her focus isn’t on her brats at all neither is it on the opponent but solely on the challenging pokemon she observes the brat and his connection to his master brat(all laugh) then men said,just an intervention this analysis was done through curtains we guess(all burst into laughter) I said absolutely(all laugh) then they said well we realize the emotions but why it never appeared to you that you’re a pokemon trainer(all burst into laughter) I said well look I wanted to know pokemons cause I wanted to know why would the difference persist(all laugh) that is I don’t like this idea of difference hence even general animals a bit hard cause they can’t give their views on existential despondency but pokemons can so through them I came to know about say an ant(all laugh) or many more whom we can’t see unlike a vulture(all burst into laughter) but I can’t ask them questions cause they don’t get it neither much from pokemons cause it’s just a friendly environment but they only say that it’s an hindrence to sanity this being too overdependent on sense faculties and not so much the mind cause the desires are more there so yeah very hard those states but not much more informations could be got from them but pokemons I ever thought could be cause that’s the basic premise why they are what they are but my trouble was the difference exactly what my Kyurem most aptly says that before being born you didn’t know anything thus this all is just an illusion ain’t it(all laugh) so yeah all are same but cause only I’m so as I know this I heard from the Squirtle life that is ever in my years what I heard day 1 at the age of 15 at pokemon special school 22 very long years back that why bother about the other if already you are you cause you’re already another(all laugh) thus this idea that why bother about yourself and not the other cause the other is also you as only they tells you that you’re another(all laugh) so this idea of difference and the actual logical impossibility of this makes me mad you see(all laugh) thus I ever asked everyone who’se that pokemon cause to me if they said it’s a Pikachu meant it’s not me and I’m not Pikachu thus it means still the difference persists in my ideas cause actually if I’m he then also he’s me then where’s he or me to begin with(all laugh) and if he’s not then neither me but then why is there this urge to know me via him then and the viseversa why bother about the other if you already know it’s not you but just another(all laugh) which doesn’t happen in any plane hence the idea of bonhomie you see everywhere in general animalia as well(all laugh) this idea of another that is me why(all laugh) this isn’t right to me hence I jumped upon pokemons cause their state intrigued me why in-between animals and human they exist and then why I exist as well(all laugh) cause if I already do then this question doesn’t come cause I know to know which I must ask this question thus it’s of no use isn’t it(all laugh) this I did as much as I could everywhere and yeah could’ve been done in philosophical school but you know monastic life isn’t for all cause that’s ultimate which I realized so thought well atleast this career can be then cause monastic life is directly about applying these on human conditions hence so so hard but this one rather easy so yeah why not(all laugh) thus I tried in my first year here and there not much joy despite well giving brats like Haunter the leeway(all laugh) but then you know I became 17 and Pangoro inhibitaion was there I asked why is there a thing called me cause it’s Pangoro ain’t it(all laugh) and the viseversa would automatically qualify if one side is thus I forced into their inhibitation despite my travel companions(all laugh) and they surrounded me when I asked them and my Whimsicott and Charizard that why should we defend if we attack(all burst into laughter) then asked them why would we attack or defend knowing we can do the respective opposites(all brust into laughter) then I asked why would we bother at all if we know what is what to being with why eat if you know what satiates hunger already(all burst into laughter) then asked them why bother to be individual while trying to know what it means(all burst into laughter) these went on in nervour channels of course(all laugh) then one Pangoro said you see lad long way to go cause your education has only reached the confusion of why will is independent of depression and the viseversa(all burst into laughter) but that’s kindergarten stuff you have to know why are we defined by us but never the other(all burst into laughter) yet we see others why(all burst into laughter) so then he came to teach me and as you see has stuck on(all laugh) then the rest of the career yeah was a zeal that have to do this and that but later after Hoenn that dropped off cause I realized it’s useless this life(all laugh) unless you live it(all burst into laughter) that is life is lived or lived is life thus actually there’s no such thing as both ain’t it(all burst into laughter) thus death too so why bother about being if it’s just the other(all laugh) thus I just roamed around with this thought as possible and you know it’s all a model just trying to follow my brats have surpassed me by far far far and they are not yet those two or three that monastries has they are different so anyway that too is a path a way the reach is same giving up the idea of being(all laugh) hence this field is what it is I ever entered with this idea and the rest is just my weakness rather than strength surely didn’t need to be bron to know the same things again(all laugh) then men were too happy(all laugh),said,yeah we realize why your Kyurem can’t be fathomed at all(all laugh) cause along with all she REVOLTS against her birth in this confinemnet of a Kyurem(all laugh) anyway,but we have a doubt(all laugh),I said well I understand it but let me finish the gross first(all laugh) they said absolutely why bother about the other that’s the time(all laugh) so I said,absolutely all cause of birth this confinement of time comes let’s break it(all laugh) then I said,well so the gym leader only observes the challenging brats connection to his master brat and thus what his master brat is trying to do and why is his brat agreeing(all laugh) thus she sees the connection and bond then predicts what they can come with next and so on all cause she knows her own bond with her own brats inside out and thus lets her brats know this then takes a step then her brat’s idea of her helps them to be in a way independent cause she asks them why are they doing what they are(all laugh) this as you see just a opposite version to my methods and countering thus which was the motivation ofcourse(all laugh) I let my brats all alone cause I want just to have a conference that’s all(all laugh) she rather wants to win hence hasn’t become insane YET(all laugh) cause she isn’t interested as to her she is her Seth and still not thus whole world is Seth to her whose Seth form in all non-psychophysicality and else is what is her so she is rather smoother in human planes(all laugh) so her idea is whatever Seth does I’ll do the opposite in gross states cause I like him(all laugh) and thus he likes her(all laugh) so the actual things are barely different all she is doing is to play with her Seth all the time nothing else(all laugh) but this game is so brutal if it’s replaced by my Brock and my Viol(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) and well jackaling games across the days isn’t that brutal hence boring(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy both uncontrollbaly laugh) but then again(all laugh) why don’t you say it yourself Gary(all laugh)..” Gary(laugh) : “two words(all laugh)”
Lillie(laugh) : “Mr Oak why is it called game not play(all burst into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “so yeah,the professionally wigged games are rather momentarily sensitive(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) so anyway.) then I said,so you see the different approaches of May and the gym leader and yeah my sis rather can think pretty fast but not long and the gym leader and me and so on the opposite so in a way it’s like that but then again there’s a spew a way to say I Drew(all uncontrollbaly laugh) cause I was too shrew thus I stopped the whole world incuding myself hence where’s movement thus why to be happy as nothing to rue(all burts into laughter) so that is Drew a Shrew that Spew method(all burst into laughter) so he you see ever draws hence(all laugh) unless of course the whole world cause they can’t know him as they can’t know Palkia(all laugh) hence only his wife can cause it’s her only thus the results(all laugh) by then men were flying as mad teacher forgot make the statesments questions hallucinations Salamence(all burst into laughter) thus said,yeah we realize why it’s a family like Ah!Boulder!Boulder!(all laugh) but well our subtle doubts are clarified much but still(all laugh),I said well it’s about realizations you see(all laugh) they said yeah,we guess she’s not a Kyurem cause you’re not either and the viseversa is only hence(all laugh) I said well the subtlity is rather intangible(all burst into laughter) then men were laughing as was I(all laugh) then they said,but may we ask something now cause doubt isn’t more direct a way to clarify a confusion than a direct question is cause doubt is general question is specifying the subtle was that so what of the gross(All laugh) I said,whether I’ve already married Ms Mehadi Waterflower or not(all burst into laughter) said,yeah(all laugh) I said no just looking for a match(all burst into laughter) they say,well don’t mind but given your sudden visit here(all laugh) you mean a real match or just the date of the match(all burst into laughter) I said no the real one first then the result will decide what she does(all laugh) said,did you have the suspicion then cause we wanted to give that(all laugh) but yeah not the hometwon our aim was to ask about Pewter and as you might’ve said a few things about that cause Brock wasn’t happy with you at all(all laugh) we thought might be a family WIDE issue(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) cause in general he is so NICE(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “you namecalled brat(all laugh) who was doing the beautiful talkings(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “well in the Pewter gym there’s a section where things are POLISHED(all burst into laughter) a too bit(all burst into laughter)..” Brock(laugh) : “I’ll check on you myself now(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “well only if at right time cause our gym leader here is too Gyaradosy now(all laugh)..” Mehadi(same pose,smile) : “you’re not allowed in private section(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “well first after renovation the private section is totally privated(all laugh) in small sections and all and then even Sarah isn’t allowed now if I’m here inside our circle(all laugh)..then they continued that our plan was to then may be tell you that some people are hurt and so on so they want to confront you on this(all laugh) then may be you would’ve understood it and we would’ve challenged for the one on one saying atleast for the talks let us see if you always are ready for matches and so on(all laugh) I said well the trouble with illusions is that what is needed to be confronted the exact opposite does get the treatment and thus the persons who delivers fumbles the lines all were needed to be known was whether I was still pestering her by keeping contacts or not that is easily clarified by asking the gentleman(all laugh) then the next is that either it’s infatuation or truth and if infatuation then that degree can’t be cured except for the devil himself(all laugh) the trouble is that the devil wasn’t contacting for 5 years at all and thus the devil wasn’t infatuated so his presence wouldn’t be there at all and then the next step is as you went through then the logic was that that level of infatuation would be categorized as exactly the opposite yet the devil isn’t bothered at all and the devil himself went off after 15 years means may be devil himself was infatuated and saved himself no matter how long thus your own cases apply(all laugh) and that is it the afterlife of the leader is of no interest what-so-ever cause is useless just best wishes no more and then if that from the leader’s part not infatuation but from the devil’s part was and thus he did what he didthen it means the only way the devil would’nt have done it if he was as much infatuated that is not being so(all laugh) so again the thing is exactly what you’re doing with the beautiful women then(all laugh) the stuff is both sided without any reason only then vaidated else may still go on but won’t be a happy affair and that which doesn’t have any reason won’t have the suspicions either from both sides and the frankness will be there from day one if not the exact words and all you saw one exactly there take the gentleman for example and Mr Oak(all burst into laughter) then compare that and you’ll get your current position only that the idea will spourt all by itself in both sides and the eventual will be the need(all laugh) so why bother about anything else thus to me if the illusion comes and can’t be taken off then the simple approach is to directly say the reason of my associetion(all laugh) and if the other side is too in illusion then mutual admiration committee is formed(all laugh) which after 2 days won’t be good at all if analyzed and if the other side directly scoffs off then save myself simple if like workplace where it can’t be helped at all(all laugh) then go to universities and all look outside profession more time with my bunch then the light will be there and it won’t be there from the subject of illusion but the illusion as a whole itself cause it’s only self created and thus self destroyed all has it’s time limit no matter how long and so the medicines are ever the bunch and the university classes and so on books and lectures and thus look off from there and reality will loom said,well this is why this meeting is fixed for increasing knowledge(all burst into laughter) then said our approach was to not be bothered at all and the opposite was the same(all laugh) then I said well is it right to say these to a stranger(all laugh) said,well we’ve known about the occasion when you confessed(all burst into laughter) I said,does she drink in these days(all burst into laughter) said well no worse(all laugh) said that that occasion was so nice with such surprize and all after 8 years but then you threw her off(all laugh) I said well I only am happy that she didn’t say the exact occasion(all laugh) said well if oiled she would’ve(all burst into laughter) cause we were among close friends those days and we came to some help on that Frucifern stuff and so on and very few people were left around her in those days barring her family I said yeah I understand(all laugh) then men became very serious and scared(all laugh) said about drinks does everything count I said yeah it does count along with the steps as you know and characters too(all laugh) why bother about things that are not real at all why bother,then men almost fell to my feet(all laugh) said,this is new stuff and it broadens the horizon(all laugh) I said yeah it does.) but why many of her friends left then around the time said,well after the break-up was strange(all laugh) and by the time the frontier trouble came around was helpless rather not by means of profession or what is to be done but her fam
