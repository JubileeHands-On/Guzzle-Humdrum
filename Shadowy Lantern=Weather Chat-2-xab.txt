you started 14 years back the anniversary is a week to go of that journey your first ever that hasn't been repeated in the last 11 years atleast Mrs Glenol do you believe it will happen may be after 3 generations(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well i can't comment on this cause they are discrete events as you understand but i can tell the only thing that i know is that you need logistics for that by yourself or someone else but mostly it must be desire and that's never about you it's about me there must be desire in me if i wanted to pull out i didn't have to tell anyone anything my bunch would've done that themselves as you subsequently saw(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"well you said many times you didn't know much at all about this profession before you began but over the course of this journey you might've surpassed your mentors in terms of capturing a whole region's attention that too in an extremely rare time for this profession when it's existence was questioned and they weren't there at all\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well the only one i know who captured any region's attention and any means everywhere is Mrs Melody Sanders Harrison and she did that from this very region(all laugh..lot) cause none touched the feat she did and none have been able to discern how she did what she did so no that hasn't been touched and that height won't be reached in quite a while now i guess(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"but you defeated..(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"firstly¬†in¬†actual¬†terms¬†her last selected compeer went to see the arrangement for next part of the conference beforehand¬†and¬†no more(all laugh..lot) then for the illusion no i didn't defeat her she did it herself completely unbeknownst to her and it was done the same way i did it after my first journey there's a limit for physique to take the pressure of psychic charges and both of us breached it the only one that succeeded from our cases certainly from my case if not my sister's are only Mr and Mrs Blackmore and they didn't make the mistake we did(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"but if you're referring to personal life then it's upto chance we can add from experiences compiled over millenias(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well the whole point is that part of life but the thing is that unlike my sis i was groomed first hand i knew everything but my desires didn't hence the clash it has nothing to do with what you're referring to on my or her relationship status(all laugh..lot)..or our physical forms for that matter(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"well we're only trying to understand the middle part of your career Mrs Glenol the start was incomparable the end has been impossible(all laugh..lot)..and these two moments itself has fetched you 4 Majors with another runner's Up at Hoenn all the completed regions and then the other you completed at Kanto we understand you recovered no matter who actually completed that as you said(all laugh..lot)..and still as we said in between that there's a runners up medal at Hoenn final against Mr Jerome Georges whose an all timer at GoC and he barely kept up with you in the initial rounds and that was a great match and again Mr Georges is in GoC by all means all times as well we understand the things you were going through emotionally till Ransei even but that Pasio journey of Ms Berlitz is what's really confusing to us Mrs Glenol(all laugh..lot) cause of the lows and highes right before and right after that seems too far fetched still to our cognition(all laugh..lot)..\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well someone with a better preparation before start can do what i did a month before but you see it depends on the bunch and that's all and there too none will surpass my record on the number of gyms and contests and all so no the first was not incomparable it isn't surpassable there's a big difference mathematics would remind us the most by means of self sufficient failure in terms of axioms(all un..)..and the last one too possibility is a very subtle thing compeers it's not impossible again it's just not attainable(all burst..) and the reason is neither my bunch nor i had to do anything here at all it was our pleasure and privilege to be able to have so e good times with our plane agnostic compeers thus it's never attainment but entailment as equanimity isn't available to itself but only it's self again(all burst..)..\"\nPress : \"indeed we agree Mrs Glenol(all burst..) but in that way as you said you were gifted 3 major titles so that you can win this one your very last and still none knows if you're a co-ordinator or a general trainer Mrs Glenol except the so called Elusiveüêâyou've done everything(all burst..)..but does this also suggest that you are that itself(all un..,Dawn..Derelicts of Honesty,all un..)..\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well if i really was that i wouldn't have bothered to enter Hoenn would i what could i get more than what I would've roaming around Sinnoh in wilderness none would've been able to object to that in the name of rangers and freelance services could they especially the last one as a profession after the whole chapter of 11 City Murmurs(all burst..,Melody..Logic's rigorous Coronation Organizer Association Bullyüêâ,all un..)..for the other two questions of yours well there's a reason why May says that she is a 4 time champ only as does Drew(all burst..,Gus..we shared the jouleasy too sweetie didn't i say first time I'm Drew hum sweetie hum,all un..,Gus..hum,Solidarity!Self-Less-Ness!Sacrifice!Commitment!,all un..,Gus..everytime she wins or draws i will not compliment her on the first time we speak rather criticize her as a DOUBLE WAY COUNTER to kill ger ego,my jealousy and promote her dedication and my vigil to match and better hers thus being attached to abstract not emotional matters being detached from others on ANY matters and then if she's not the ONE OF ONE then i will move on JUST as you're moving around Unovan bushes faking a mask of humility after official confirmation of your engagement and all these talks and thoughts I WILL SEND YOU THE TALKS AND VIDEOS REAL TIME,all un..long,Drew and May un..long,Guang..AND THIS IS Education,all un..long,Drew and May un..long) and i do say the same thing i only have this Johto League to my credit compeers the rest Sinnoh Contest,League and Frontier belongs to my dear big bros and and ofcourse mostly uncle crook(all laugh..lot,Dawn..That Feeling,all burst..)..then the next one was mine and that was the atmost i could do before my last journey which as i said i didn't complete it fully(all laugh..lot) so yeah i know what is what hence i tell you to keep off the poison of the brown emotion in the soothing comfort of green grass especially at Johto as my sis has been telling you for 19 years now about 8,8 in psychology of effusiveness(all burst..,Melody un..)..anyway about my Pasio journey well i wasn't in the right state of mind and didn't do the right things that's all then i met my other half in physique finally hence returned else i would've been gone\"\nPress : \"well in accordance to that and what happened to Mrs Poppy..(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"has nothing to do with me or my compeers i know my bro and i know my sis and that's all..and about your questions in gross Mrs Poppy Waterflower Ketchum was absent from public for 4 months after 41 Years constantly spending under the spotlight and those who can't see the subsequent 2.5 will not see beyond her physical existence hence they should ask this question after she's gone may be tomorrow and no more can i say except that she wasn't involved in profession then her bunch wasn't there with her she was doing some nasty things but they only affected her and she stayed at a resort which was the property of Mr Kumaglak Kunilak whose her little bro who employed two dedicated staffs to look after her who were only Mr Brauch Xarar and Mrs Sarah Nomis Xarar who were among the foremost of people(all burst..,Guang and Gus un..) who knew her from way before she was born(all laugh..lot)..physically(all burst..)..they did what they could do none can stop the reality of Poppy Flower if that being decided to do something unless for her involution as you understand hence it was the best optimization indeed(all laugh..lot)..as why that being would want to do that it was only the testing of existense of the involution that she was trying and that's also now too minutely well documented in children's rhymes too i hear(all laugh..lot)..\"\nPress : \"perfectly comprehensive Mrs Glenol thanks(all burst..) but one thing is still unclear Mrs Glenol is that in case of Mrs Harrison she never was a travel companion of your mentors and the others who have been are in the gym leader's positions at various cities who travelled at Sinnoh at the time Mr Guang Ketchum did with his host Daily Hologram the latest among the most esoteric ones(all laugh..lot)..so does it imply anything as to that they made sure you couldn't do it without them and in case of Mr and Mrs Blackmore they weren't what you were at first region and yeah Mrs Harrison did travel with Dr Oak throughout Pasio and Johto doesn't that help her results somehow (all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well the last i can't answer you when they started i was still in elementary not even in second year(all laugh..lot) and i had not much interest as you all know about the second Mr and Mrs Blackmore picked what we did later and it was done through a much prolonged span of time hence they had more control over everything Mrs Blackmore bloomed late and when she did none came anywhere near her in terms of matching her except her other half who still only drew as you know..(all laugh a lot)..(all burst..,Drew un..)..anyway jokes aside(all laugh..lot,Gus and Dawn..hum,Quip!Wit!Sarcasm!HUMOUR!,all un..long,Drew and May too un..long) Mr Blackmore caught a Flygon as his fourth ever catch he did have Mr Tony Thompson with him but then he wasn't at the level he was by the end of that journey he's telling that to all who'll listen for the last 18 long years now(all laugh..lot,Genkai and Blossom,Hua,Wijdan and Gus..Tony Boy,all laugh..lot) and so Mr Blackmore had certainly what it takes to do what i did but he didn't want to do it then he did it himself..\"\nPress : \"sorry for an interruption but did he somehow didn't do it in consistence to his personal life as you mentioned earlier about parity and rest(all burst..)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"most definitely there's no other reason cause he knew each of the things i knew infact anyone knows those cause they were being published everyday just as i finished which is the single most important reason why my personal life became extremely difficult subsequently(all laugh..lot) and about your first question whether they made sure of our lifelong faithfulness or not i just gave you the answer of that(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"well you've directly stated and Mrs Tirrison implied at her Unova journey and later at Rimsable that you two weren't treated well singularly by Mr Guang and Gus Ketchum and specifically by the latter(all laugh..lot,Iris,Serena,Dawn and May..TYRAniTAR,all burst..)..later there was a mystery surrounding Mrs Toganne Tomkins' Unova contest journey then Mrs Blackmore weren't in speaking terms with him though Mr Maple brushed the speculation aside saying deportation oriented solitude(all un..)..but what our surprise is that only all of their si..(all burst..)..\"\nDawn(straight) : \"yeah i get i get it(all laugh..lot) well that's cause the reflections of other shore of emotion aren't available to public and it shouldn't either all puns intended my hubby would add and especially Mr Tirrison you may look at his daily reporting to 9 City Conglomerate for 15 years from Rimsable if you're still not clear(all burst..,Melody un..)..the reason why Mr Blackmore said what you said he said then was because he knew how to handle aptitude based transformation (all un..,Gus..Education..,all un..)..so he knew what was exactly what that is what as you know the magnitude of return which is what he's been minutely trained at(all burst..,Gus..hum,Management!Com-Passion! DISSIPATION! PROTECTION!,all un..,Guang..Civility,all un..) and you know about the works and influences of my dad Mr Glenol(all laugh..lot).. anyway back to the privilege or opportunity to be a travel companion of theirs how would you categorize my case(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"well your case was an opportunity as was Mr and Mrs Blackmore's unlike say Mr Salusar and Mrs Rarcia(all laugh..lot)..then Mrs Tirrison did travel finally with you all at Sinnoh but you were refused at 2 whole regions the second of which is very difficult to comprehend from our part on their actions throughout(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"all of our cases were opportunities and there's a trend in recent times to take Mrs Rarcia for granted i'm sure we all know her full career right especially the Kanto League final and the Elite4 challenge and what her current official rank is and the fact that she along with her other half who is also in all time HoF and also saw out undercover and lived for Unovan Bushes reloaded(all laugh..lot) they have personally been selected as vice head and personal secretary by Marc The Mr Litman..rest unnecessary(all laugh..lot,Iris..no Mr and Mrs Rarcia when you finish your sentences don't say that's all say this is the gist of what i feel as else it makes you preempt from the conversation cause you can't add further you're neither concentrated to listen nor to finish nor interested to go further in the subject compeers once my Scizor failed to provide a trap only a coy due this not understanding this thus lost 3 rounds you know despite the toss of starting the plan,all un..long,Iris..Marc the Mr Litman no more options required,all un..)..\"\nPress : \"there's no doubt about that Mrs Glenol but the thing is that you didn't have the privilege she had during undercover ok that's accident but still she was accepted to actually go to the spot and then Kanto and all being properly guided(all laugh..lot)\nDawn(straight) : \"that's because of her career before she was a 7 time champ in first 7 regions all by herself if i had that behind me i would've jumped into undercover too may be cause atleast by means of battling say even 3 on 1 even with boosters but fair rules and no more than 3 trainers each having own pokemon you can't win fair battles atleast against me even if don't lose(all laugh..lot)..and definitely not get away from that without further consequences if my bunch has seen Unova 0th hand having come from exact same valleys like on a contract(all laugh..long)..except for Mr Nofcan none would've beaten her at Kanto and he did it in a 16 minutes very last round case that too his Goodra stood up at 18 Mrs Rarcia's took 6 exact more seconds and no more(all laugh..lot)..then at Elite4 challenge she lost only so few rounds no matches barring Mr Marc Litman reasoning unnecessary after the very name(all burst..,..Marc The Mr Litman)..and well about the main difference between she being pampered and me being declined is all cause what i understood much later that i wouldn't be alive physically if i was allowed which no matter my wish would've had repercussions in society who don't understand all the intricate nuances of Pokemon Training including researchers and all included the things i've come to know in this journey even Dr Oak i believe didn't know before the Unovan Trouble started 2 years back infact none knew among us now it's public knowledge without the counter which select few can and will know or be given which has been in my case this time(all laugh..lot)..it's tacit knowledge and one has to face say a Heatmore at a volcano bed to really get it(all laugh..lot) but the thing is that it's given to me cause i was told about these there itself by the two persons you mentioned they subsequently only validated themselves at Unova cause that wasn't for learning it was for application it's like death none will listen to our practice or sentiment or life stories there or the fact that i want to look at life once more it's like that the spontaneity there's no knowledge only application which isn't the case if seen closely but that's in terms of self in terms of it's about training and meaning as they've been saying for 41 years now that too constant(all laugh..lot)..and Dr Oak included hence what we had to come across at best through logic he would've only had to recognize which he doesn't need to if he's a professional of specific as you understand Hands-On(all un..)..so as for that matter no i only understood later their actions as did their own other halves and Mrs Fressia Waterflower Ketchum was traveling throughout Unova and Kalos and I don't need to talk about her so if it was a mystery to her what her other half was doing even while traveling with her most definitely it will be to his little sisters who were traveling in different regions with misconceptions over communication of being and intention vs contact of soul and information(all laugh..lot)..and unlike any Dr Oak would've been able to understand things just as they appeared as i said this included as he was an apprentice under Jubilee Hands-On upon how to run a lab not being present in the same region for 10 very long years while winning a league after securing 120 pokemons in very first region and having flagged off the beginning of Tyranitar(all laugh..lot)..so yeah this lifelong faithfulness benefits people neither the objects nor their practice unless for the later they acknowledge what they want and what they're at present doing so yeah you can say in a way they only made sure i know that i was their very own much more than spatiotemporal scales can ever define which if certainly i rememberd i would've had an easier journey less wasteful that's all but it all is conjecture now and hence implausible to talk about(all laugh..lot) and as for Melody well her case was much more difficult and different to me but again she admits this all time she should've done what i should've too that is travel with any or all of the people that we were suggested to travel with exactly what Mrs Rarcia did after undercover that or talk with the suggested people among whom also are the exact persons that we both eventually will talk with all our lives as a signed agreement by your consensus law and nothing else(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"well about that Mrs Glenol,Mrs Tirrison's case we all know your case wasn't so after Hoenn so it must be extremely dangerous what you were exposed to in the name of practices at Sinnoh(all burst..)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well you said the word yourselves (all burst..,Sirichai.. that's a DANGEROUS consequence Sirich retrospectively exactly how Cidu had to leave his job you know,all un..,..The Eureka Ones,all un..) i turned 20 and found myself alone suddenly with confusions all over so i was talking with people whom i only should've spoken with to use lexicon properly(all laugh..lot) and yes it was dangerous in terms of training it always is dangerous to keep a Spinda even as you know Dr Serena Toganne Tomkins' stories of her co-ordinator days at Unova the two months(all laugh..lot,Serena bursts..)..\"\nPress : \"yes we acknowledge that but also we hear how she too the very next month after being dragged all over the whole Hoenn and Ransei region for a month got married the very next month so she too was helped in a way only after she attempted to face a not fully tamed Kommo-O with a domesticated Spinda in a contest second round firstly is that the test of courage secondly is that a pattern in this(all burst..,Guang,Gus,Bazugh and Serena un..)..\"\nDawn(straight) : \"no it's not a test of courage it was an act of emergency to preempt her from the mythical Unovan bushes where none goes first up pro or amatuer with even a Marill(all burst..,Guang and Gus..Mr Skechit why you think and do and not do or think so after thinking or doing/thus jumping into ocean with Marill..will be ruing,all un..)..and she wasn't alone but had about 100 of her siblings looking after her day and night infact her other half was the main field referee in that occasion itself by procedural decisions(all laugh..lot) so only there it might've been an act of courage(all burst..,Bazugh and Serena un..)..she couldn't do it alone hence was left not lone as they'd say(all laugh..lot) but we could and we were champs hence our cases were handled differently Mrs Tirrison not going to Hoenn i know for record first hand was a pure case of inter sibling rivalry with our big bro Mr Gus Ketchum taking the side of Dr Oak for a change which none can do as she will tell you first hand(all laugh..lot,Melody..yeah bro..hush now oh being did your attention your notion just poke,all un..long,Melody..thus you said yeah to only catch my attention so that you can refocus your self upon your being..thus feed yes as another thing to in continuation to your thoughts upto the point..to the next point of expectation from the recurring logic to deem secured intellect as bro,all un..long,Melody..no you can't sign for her and push her into anywhere you want..so that somewhere professionally can say the personal what's,all un..long,Melody..Pasio Hush,all un..)..besides my nephews are still unsure if i'm elder to her or the reverse(all laugh..lot,Melody too laughs..lot)..then with this precursor the pattern is familiar that if i disgorge a food you can't make me eat that that was the case in both our cases she did it unknowingly in it's entirety and that was proven by her Frontier journey and the 4 journeys she had her family with her she reached the last step three times one loss against Dr Oak is considered a professional debut to training those who faced him know that like Mrs Riley Rednak Reid has been saying for 27 years constant yeah almost half her life(all laugh..lot)..physical that is(all burst..),and then she had faced Mrs Bujona Eritak in semis in her first region whom we all know about(all laugh..lot,Guang and Gus..Taxi,all laugh..lot) then Melody did the unthinkable here few months short of 20 years back beating Slalom Seldom and Column Jargon consecutively leaving the ball to Unovan courts absolutely as she postponed it for 9 years and most of all saved Mrs Blackmore from University classes on psychology(all laugh..lot,May bursts..)..then she did do that final with me where i didn't know one damn thing as to why i was doing what i was doing except for the fact that i knew that i was doing what was being asked of me to be done by rationality not logic(all burst..)..so there's no credit for me in there and the fact of the matter is i didn't need to go against her i could've done it the month later and the Frontier earlier but that means i would've faced Mr Genkai Oak rest insured by Mrs Tirrison herself(all burst..,Melody un..)..she never wanted to win unlike what i did and all except Kalos and Unova where she failed to get past Round 64 then barely manager to make it to the finals and i didn't finish even a year in 4 successive regions two of which were Kalos and Unova that's for stats(all laugh..lot)..those two are the hardest regions in terms of the trekking Unova is legendary for the Elusive bushes Kalos for it's unofficial challenges with say a Zygarde against a Magnezone that's inhuman as Dr Jackal noticed still a physical teenager(all un..,Dawn..Tickle Mastery,all un..)..anyway the way i was taught or Mrs Tirrison understood things we needed the daily personal care which we ignored completely cause we were so emotionally attached to our bros we didn't see past that and then had our own incentives Mrs Blackmore was far more infatuated with bro than both me and Melody combined but you see she is a bit shrew thus only there's 2 exact leagues of her own rest 4 she drew(all burst..,Gus..Hum..Liability!Liberty!Compultion!Workaholism!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..so the pattern is like that and yeah all of us sisters were too emotionally attached to bro,Bonnie had to talk with Gungie each day and never once with her hubby on how to educate her daughter infact her hubby was banished from home as a revenge for not allowing her to travel with her big bros no matter first how old Bambie was with them anything is possible(all burst..,Guang..Hum,Faith!Trust!Sercurity!Dependability!Insurance!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..and secondly the fact that she was a high ranked üêâ specialist herself she vehemently remonstrated with her hubby though who had same recognition that they didn't know the ELUSIVE üêâ (all laugh..lot) which has absolutely nothing to do with the idea of others only the types of projection what to speak of creatures not breeders(all burst..,Gus..Cili this a KOMMO-O,um..no Sir he meant he once showed Jingie the chance of a certain result in discrete but consecutive dice throws,all un..,Guang.. Probability : the assurance of THE Elusiveüêâ,all un..,Cilan shakes..)..and the reason is best explained by their respective flowers only and their influences on the likes of Mr Redzep Rafolrat the foremost never elaborated further(all burst..,Guang and Gus..Mr Hummm-Bertoooo 'NUOUGH-ON-STAT..,all un..long,Drew..Culture..,all un..,Guang and Gus un..long) hence during their breakup years most of their sisters and brothers were also against each other at home only making it clear to them that it made no sense at all(all laugh..lot)..and the reasoning behind is that the inter brothers and inter sisters relationships with them isn't very proper to elaborate in public i know the best i was 17,Lillie flower was 36 not months physically rest never mattered like Lillie flower(all burst..),and Poppy was 33 and we argued each day atleast an hour on hour itself(all laugh..lot,Bonnie,Serena,Melody,Iris,Dawn and May..Daily Daily WaterFire/Hasty Hasty Logic mire,all un..,Guang and Gus un..)..and that is why the Waterflower Sisters are known across dimensions as you see their bunches now a days especially Daisy's(all laugh..lot)..they had this this relationship each representative of an ideal which was only the strategies of self consuming oneness hence they all only are variable in terms of subsuming themselves as subsisting not consisting their own path thus their lifelong arguments they don't have enough patience to talk about anything personal among themselves and their hubbies beyond half an hour but that is vehemently insisted upon as part of their scheme which their hubbies wanted to always make either 35 or 25 cause they insist the exact opposite as they can subsume themselves never subsist thus the behaviours where they refuse their soulmates physical presence(all laugh..lot)..so it's about that and still among the sisters it's always about that aspiration but among the brothers it's the distortion hence it's best left in private Mr Blackmore knows this all the more(all laugh..lot)..and why they never faced anything is called with distortions they become a bit shrew thus they find a way to discombobulate personal life by saying we only drew(all un..long,Gus..HUM,Co-Operation!Truth-Full-Ness! Discussion!Perseverance!Fortitude!Hoensty!Loyalty!Morality!Optimism!Assurance! Recycling the whole of this EACH TIME THERE'S an disagreement! different opinions!dissent!OUTRAGE!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..so yeah that's the pattern and if we do our job properly it's going to repeat again next gen(all laugh..lot)..\"\nPress : \"thanks for the detailed clarification Mrs Glenol(all burst..) but from your surmise it seems that Dr Glenol was sent to Flexdijon in that turmoil with an attempt of heist there by the runaway Unova Purge Group so if that's their relationships with their brothers then it doesn't seem to always follow rationality to us(all

hence afterwards your life was in shambles now he says jokingly that he was so glad that you weren't ok mentally like this journey yourself cause you had amplifiers then anyway(all laugh..lot)..but what we want to say is that Mrs Glenol that in the last 8 months all the acrinonies surrounding you and your mentors and all seemes to have finally dissapread for good for the rest of next generation atleast and we hold this factor down to the in their words eloquence of the Riumina herd there at Oak Labs HQ(all laugh..lot) do you and your other half from first hand believe it or just the fact finally all the Elite4 facilitators has had to acknowledge their works finally after their Hands-On poof of 8,8(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(smile) : \"well for both of us like all of you too i know it's just that they've been debarred from leaving physically through a concensus among the smogons and that's all\"\nPress : \"indeed we completely agree with both of you Mrs Glenon that they managed to

Lillie flower(all laugh..lot,..Lillie flower)..rest are famous cause you can aspire unto them the others are only assimilating ever(all laugh..lot)..it's the same reason why 6 consecutive leagues that

character of simplicity and rest at a go especially if oneness is concerned a serious practitioner can't later and doesn't during vow hide own character hence her style is like that it's incredibly complex to entwine together in matter of seconds and hence eventually her bunch lost interest in attacking or defending but detached understanding thus formulative observation  exactly what Dr Jackal advocates for just to spend the days as existence finds them as they'd say(all laugh..lot,..The Fitted Ones,all burst..)..so yeah they both are like that Daisy is most elaborating Dr Skechit obviously

know much about Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum's relationship with you ever her life infact since she became the gym leader still remains in dark to public as much as Mr Gus Ketchum's personal

Mrs Blackmore knew a bit more but absolutely nothing she ever got from bro on his opinions on Mehadi being a gym leader at Cerulean that is this particular city out of the whole of the world as you know he doesn't like that name cause of it's bias towards the tranquility of water type rather than in his interpretation the robustness of cold in ice types like the very neighbourhood city has(all laugh..lot,Gus..Cerulean!)..he doesn't like the way the city is planned the way the houses are built the way the practice facilities work and so on he doesn't understand why the common people there behave differently to Accumula his ideal city he tried to sketch here became a town(all laugh..lot)..cause in his world need and entailment has no difference(all un..,Colony Monogram,all un..,Gus too un..)..he was hopeful that rather Mr Stuart McShin will be the gym leader there which he objected to as ethical deceit understand this term first(all un..long,Guang and Gus..Sweet Cute Stu Speaking,all un..)..hence there's this irritation like version controls you see hence Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum,CoE,Cerulean,Kanto is completely under self management(all laugh..lot)..infact i knew bro tried to shift her away to specialist post but his siblings refused because they were completely blinded by Mehadi's views and ideal and all she's just too big a personality no matter how she appears this all admits barring her husband ofcourse as you know he doesn't like to talk about his personal life with her to start with(all burst..,Guang..The Darkened Ones,all un..,Gus too un..)\"\nPress : \"well thanks again Mrs Glenol we understand since the beginning that he's ferociously protective of his other half's public image(all laugh..lot)..lastly then are you going to work as a judge or ranger(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well it's so fitting compeers that my travelling career ends like this with this note cause i started with this question of actions and habits and practice of self unbinding to Simile Popcorn who as you mentioned the word referred me to Lastly Phantom and thus i began he'd say to elaborate not actuate..(all burst..)..(all un..) so i'll end with this too what i do next look tense says Phantom..anything else countering?(all burst..)..(all un..,Iris and Dawn..Lastly The Playboy Confirm,all un..)\"",

observed\"\nHumdrum : \"no no it's so far respected ones i don't understand what can i do about it even if i do(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"then you follow the inspection path as to the conservation between choice and intention obviously\"\nHumdrum : \"i don't understand what i can get by doing or not doing so respected ones what can i do about it it's like an invited counter what really is there that i can do i don't know i don't understand(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"that's the inspection that's said compeer\"\nHumdrum : \"ofcourse and that's why I'm afraid of it what if i become that too I'll have to understand it which i don't know how i can cause it's present i'm content of attention of self(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"because you're taking attention as subject compeer but in reality it's object of self the all pervading\"\nHumdrum : \"invading respected ones i don't see any reason not to just as appear(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"you'll be asked again compeer but let's see what Lastly Phantom says(all laugh..lot)\"\nPhantom : \"attention : the Phantom of meaning(all un..long)..infact it could be anything respected ones cause attention is the need of thing,thing : the most deforming..so strange the Phantom of being(all un..)..just recurring indeed the Phantom of verb-ing..the most present, presence : the Phantom of ping(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"so you follow attention infact thus go beyond that by obviously sidestepping\"\nPhantom : \"the Ash of thing why(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"then deny the absolute\"\nPhantom : \"the wishful flute indeed(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"how are you spontaneous compeer then\"\nPhantom : \"the ing of then,then : the most presenceless thus ing the Phantom of sense COUNTERING hence(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"that's against your inspection of self in question isn't it compeer rather attention to ego not consciousness\"\nHumdrum : \"but my question is what can or cannot i do or don't do or to stay neutral at both about things respected ones what does these even mean(all un..long) except that they're in distribution so ensuing(all un..long)..and still i can't do anything at all as I : the atmost of being(all un..long)..self might be there if i was to be self i will be the most accepting what can i be doing then afterwards respected ones no matter the veracity or falsity of what i said or found or am except countering : the nature of beginning the feature of the most ending thus between thee is the algorithm of denomination that this is a thing : the craft of needing(all un..long)..whereas need is obviously the notion of dealing which means nothing except it's just that : the meaning(all un..long) thus i can do COUNTERING if they disturb my feeling which in reverse counters me as i'm me the action of doing the most redundant except for the meaning(all un..long)..hence i have no clue what i'm doing at all except that I : the reasoning of the most countering(all un..long)..what else to with I otherwise i don't understand like this action : the limitation of sections(all un..long)..no matter of they are or are formed by it action is self sufficient only if not needed for self : the most deferring..HELP!(all un..long)..this cry the most my seen by i me thus to recognition say hallow never hi to be the most updating not stagnant in the processes of countering who and why the what of the most conserving..the preface of swat(all un..long)..but this system is sufficient with or without self with or without any help in and out and in exchanges cause there's a problem if only there's a solution else there's no need for continuation the most distracting from actuation.. actuation : the reticence of caution(all un..long) hence i don't know what i can do about all these at all as a pre-caution(all un..long) or what can i do when the caution is deluded by success or caution has been addressed and optimized and so on what does this supposed to mean respected ones as i know it is beyond my reach how can i know these things at all if they are or aren't at all(all un..long) but neutral to me thus i don't understand what am i doing at all or what does this caution even mean except meaning : the humdrum of ing..the most present(all un..long)\"\nPertinent People : \"the inspection of being\"\nHumdrum : \"of the lack of ego to self indeed that feeling but here's the conservation between awareness of other and attention to bother respected ones of themselves i can't do at all a thing(all un..long)..except for just to be countering..the most engaging(all un..long)..besides this is what random vultures do i saw if random how to be the mean in ing respected ones the humdrum of thing(all un..long)..hence with all this i thought ok just to be countering(all un..long)..but this is reflective reflexively recurrent to counter itself yet in random illogical the illness is the vulture of cling..but again i saw me in all this just for each other to be countering respected ones thus i can say..shh..meaning of exclaimation the reference to self oh so being(all un..long)..again as a whole all only for me to be countering..what thus can i do about these respected ones but to be the most engulfing(all un..long)..which only necessitates the meaning again the necessary being surviving but even if i do or don't i don't understand what is what respected ones what does THIS even mean but the meaning : the Guzzling of Miss(all un..long)..so if i miss something i end up into the land of that,that : the fact of crowing,the detached crow of intention really this desire thus respected one so much mentioning(all un..long,Cedar..Exclamation : The Curly Mention,all un..long) but this is the darkness of discrimination the most indiscriminating rationalising(all un..long,Cedar..Welcome: another Caution!Colony Monogram!,all un..long)..these two you know well these two are associated with the obsession of reason to perfection and obsession to cessation thus can't be gripped by intelligence only drilled by commemoration(all un..long,.. Incentive Overdose ordering the Baby Gyarados,all un..)..and then there's so many i see now they really aren't at all me but you just as i say me the cue..the most reflexive due(all un..long)..hence yet I don't understand why i've been disturbed this time respected ones really what can i add what can i rue except to do..to the most engaging do the most deciding..countering says conservation of

    "body": "Gary(laughing..) : \"so then they said how Zee comes how he understood these things(all laugh..lot)..said no she cried all the time so i thought she must be in pursuit to be happy thus i asked her greetings compeer are you bowing compeer are you bowing to infinitesimals from infinity(all un..)..she put her finger in her mouth meaning she wasn't assured of the inside and outside apprearances of qualia from affordability of mental awareness(all un..)..so i asked are you alright compeer are you opposed to interpretation of incidence of result upon action(all un..)..then she giggled meaning she asked me what i meant if she was in pursuit of excellence would've beamed never cried anyway if was for reliability would've smiled like pokemons no emotional acceptance only confirmation(all un..)..anything else requires logic compeer of me so i could obviously help what else is possible compeer to deem you're no more my(all un..) thus Namely Fulcrum and Gamely In-Form those two in abstraction in gross only emulating against those conscious not existential objection in reflection thus not a simulation in mere concentration(all un..)..anyway thse two thus will tell you why to i thus me being my you thus to i say hallow never hi..towards emancipation of self from noun the most inspiring(all un..)..then they asked what about the practice of asking who i am said that is asked of i the witness not i the qualia next situation never question or silence dual connection-neither witness not consciousness-really Hands-On(all un..,Cedar..that's it that's it..if you're so infatuated with my concerns i stay at Hoenn you here we're anyway existentially married what's the trouble hum i can't continue to work as a mercenary of my own decision of commitment to objective analytics of perception ok,all un..,Cedar..um..no bro said it's only cognition your decision as you understand it to be own thus never to conformity have you lent it as a stopping criterion for lexicon : referentially the precise a-lone,all un..,Cedar..thus you're commited to situation of analysis not perception of useable metrics at all as that's self sufficient what do you or me have to do with the other's logical practice only metaphysical ethics,all un..,Cedar..learnt from Mr Define Guise,all un..)..anyway(all un..),the he said there's another class though who are in pursuit of obsession just to countering it itself via the meaning rather-but also transpose of the two in counter to incision-than the definition(all un..)..this group of being is only the opportunists of dual renditions hence really can't be helped or delt only observed if that in detachment to type only felt(all un..,..Intriguing : feeling the Boomerang of Elusive Bushes,all un..,Tracey and Brock shake..)..and these are possible from the other type to excellence as i said,they said which type you're,very strange again compeers as you asked i only said what lexicon said of conjecture Hands-On..probably as dual and referentially as the precise real-the most latest,countering infinity the greatest(all un..)..thus i asked Zee that question cause happiness is ever in real meaning never in dual essence(all un..long)..so after i ask her of value of effort in her qualia she answered dubious thus in hospital it could be analysed more  if she says positive by continuing to giggle she must be asked of usage of situation if she still giggles she can be classified as the Registered Ones(all un..long)..if she doesn't giggle but beams means she's among the Convicted Ones(all un..)..if is neutral means she's among The Feathered Ones thus dually counting discretely applying(all un..long)..if she says negative to usage in her qualia then the hospital can help her but if there she pokes her tongue out it will mean she's among the Forsaken Ones duality will tell you they're really the most opportunists(all un..long,..Dregs of Insufferable Hellfire,all un..long)..if she remains dubious by not doing anything after they check for spontaneity means she's a student of self conservation : thus situationally against being the most competitive(all un..)..hence is classed as the Chosen Ones like those two or the feeling ones the observing ones they are the association of deepening of real qualia towards dual quality(all un..)..but you see if she isn't available to be countered by any thing as dual such as me and you and isn't addressable by anything real such as phew and cue(all un..) then i admit it's very hard for situational justice to come to any conclusion before it's obliterated as it trying to disturb the peace of last..discernibly to reference-the most inexistent(all un..long)..that's the never two never one never both nor neither nor is anything else and so on as i said it's Lastly,Humdrum : A Random Sojourn(all un..long,Brock and Violet..Humdrum if is this being/or if self in combination feeling/guzzle or define else in dual dealing/reality/why nuzzle nuzzle..me/E!/Guzzle Humdrum Humdrum..reality thus you see/E!/why and how you nuzzle nuzzle..me/E!/that question clarification or statement..don't nuzzle nuzzle..me,all un..,Cedar..Numbers look self to being to self..Random Random..also random you too..See/E!/why then oh then you too..nuzzle and nuzzle you too,nuzzle nuzzle..me,Tracey and Daisy..Guzzle Humdrum Humdrum.. reflection including The,all un..long,Cedar..Thus Situation counter or do anything else or don't why with counter too you nuzzle nuzzle..me,all un..long)..thankfully Guzzle Humdrum came after people were accustomed only Possible Hands-On,practice a necessary counter(all un..long)..anyway then someone unfortunately asked Zed from where are you going to get money,the compassion of success..the most retrospective(all un..)..and didn't say anything else but Zed asked the Police to find some compassionate people who believes they can help themselves cause they've too much for themselves thus in retrospect understand the risk of being alone themselves the most nary(all un..)..so the Police organized a few people who were told if they knew they had created a problem via their ambitions so much as to now they have to live with the ambitious..the most categorizing(all un..),then someone said this is ego said without that how can i understand need compeer only arising of notation and setting of how so(all un..)..so they understood this is Hands-On life intellectually the most devastating(all un..)..so they gave this and that but the doctors said this will require a long time treatment which Zed said is a terrible idea to survival of what's now needed(all un..)..then he was present at Hospital then classified Zee as the Chosen Ones with unanimous votes from Weyo and Hemu who were living with Zed now(all laugh..lot)..cause after Zee came all understood Jubilee Hands-On is a horrendous curse to society at like 1.5 already what's he gonna do at 25 exactly when started..\ncompassion has got whole of development..in the attempted hand\nMetagross don't thus try to help..what's in your qualia's sand(all un..)\nOther Other Other..why add an to other now(all un..)\nJust to return to preposition the..thus Onix ask why..don't favour how(all un..,Daisy..That Feeling,all un..,Poppy and Mehadi..Dashing Leading Rock,all un..,Brock shakes..)..\nthen next is that they said we'll give more later,the expectation on probability through decision of now intellectually chatter(all un..)..then they said so you work only for self morality,self : the notation of relevant others(all un..)..thus i didn't understand your question compeers on works cause there's no work Hands-On only in discussion of differentiability with intention's procedural monogram(all un..,Lillie..Poppy,Mehu enough with this obsession of parametricizing them they can't get your self cause you're hindering it with their personalities,all un..,Poppy and Mehadi..Lillie flower,Lillie..Shut up you namecall!read this for your professional presentation of intuition to them agnostic to knowledge of self that's of the intuition hereby having a specific rather than optimal personality,all un..,Lillie..read this how THEY say knowledge is acute only if unnecessary to necessary duality in conviction else it's only magnitude of return to solvabale oneness,all un..,Lillie..Article-Frucifern Caution!Convene Skats!,all un..long)..so then all had to show enough money for one whole month of extensive program and this was from their own recuperation strategies cause that's implausible to uncertainty of replenishment exactly why they started to work from the beginning against survival-impossible to do if done..Hands-On(all un..long)..as there's no survival or intention or self or being or ego..only their usability : The Referential Lexicon(all un..),refereeing between the fight of counter and meaning of the same.. that's normalcy-Hands-On(all un..long)..so then all these were going around Weyo and Hemu unshackled themselves here and they were introduced to Doctor Slate in return Zed was introduced to DaisyDevil and Ms Volbeat both thoroughly unstable in existence only intelligbility countering their completely headless Baby Gyaradoses(all laugh..lot)..and no they were in regular contacts respectively with Doctor Slate and The Ghosts of Lexicon(all burst..) and the same and Zed no Doctor Slate cause Ms Volbeat didn't LIKE him(all laugh..lot)..man that was a horrendous game of parallelism they played for so many years obviously as..\ncan you feel it come to say Onix don't try to feel..let both be in feeling's hand(all un..,Tracey and Daisy..The Unfolded Ones,all un..Brock and Violet un..)..but obviously the management bully didn't get involved only informed(all un..,..DaisyDevil,all un..,Daisy too un..)..but the latest was obviously the most supple like i first time said hallow Mr Skechit nice to meet you finally,you wanted to say in terms of terminal condition of named entities if algorithmized to distinguish them from recognised sentiments of assurance a mixture of logic and entailment you wanted the former(all un..,Brock and Violet,I'm the Jackal of Usage/thus ü¶ä of intented/Look at my skills..i'm Tracey of Permitted,all un..long,Lillie..Oh my dear bro and sis..Don't ask for my signature/as i'm the ü¶ä of Fracture,all un..long,Tracey too un..)..no this heinous sly fox with his feeling crook has been after me for years following their hideous disciple pests and their absolutely headless beaus(all laugh..lot)..\"\nCuong and Fressia&Seth and Mehadi(unison..,laughing) : \"yeah this is how to do this thing for..hush now oh Mr..did you feel so consequently broke(all un..long)/thus now you said for to know from before what's after the preset definition to start thus Dr Oak(all un..long)/um..yeah just the work itself to..no no no no no personality profession can't poke(all un..long)/as the former is just being self latter to self's being only a-self sufficient thus redundant except validational purpose-thing hence just Mr in plural S of Oak(all un..long,..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"atleast unlike you namecalls we didn't say like they are existential in confidence of problem Gary not incidence of it in own solution(all un..,..The Clinical Darkness,all un..)..and these Convene Skats intentionally mingled only ME into this mess of rental master brats as üè† owner(all laugh..lot)..they never stay in their rooms at all except respectively .25 Hours each for preparatory and refreshing of the  middling 1.5 hour of daily sabbatical from emotions(all burst..)..first time in physical awareness after more than 42.25 years since 1.25(all burst..)..and their baby brat still refuses to sleep in a room if in physical awareness(all laugh..lot)..their rooms have absolutely nothing except a water pot for each of the two who share a confirmation of directivity not direction(all un..)..and the pots are never filled except when they're in(all burst..)..but they keep a set of direct hand combat pads never gloves(all burst..)..except these two they only keep a latest version of metaphysical lexicon(all un..long)..except for these they only have a mat to sit never for sleep cause of morality of referral not analytical awareness(all un..)..and that's absolutely it for gross objects and yes only the water pot is their own nothing else(all laugh..lot)..they don't go to washrooms there now which they never did always going out with pokemons(all burst..) and they use natural ingredients to wash mouth never uses toothbrush(all laugh..lot)..this was the same when they were in their methods except they had a mattress and a warm blanket if had to sleep 3 hours 30 minutes getting in and getting out 30 minutes(all laugh..lot) they used old rags though picked up from places lived at the Frucifern forest not at home only sometimes used to come here as aunty insisted away from garbage dumps and leftovers(all laugh..lot)..but Genkie and Blossie lived on my shoulders only(all laugh..lot,Genkai..Ei Gary i'm hungry give me..hush now oh Mr..did hunger smell your attention's roast/thus now you're hungry of form thus just Dr Oak,all un..long,Blossom..bro i'm afraid of..hush did your knowledge your desire smoke/hence now you're wanting to know thus say just Dr Oak,all un..long)..atleast i didn't say like,\nyou eat me eat everything is ok/i eat my eat hang on ok(all un..long,Lillie..As Logic Seldom Seldom To Rationality Slalom/Thus Column becomes metaphysical..from ontological Jargon,all un..long,..The Feathered Ones,all un..)..no these two menaces always poke onky MY life(all laugh..lot,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)..and then their conveners were most dreadful to society as they were after meticulousness and obsession in descending order never professional terms exactly as their beaus were after precision and ideology never personal terms(all laugh..lot)..but because these two were saturated in professionalized meaning they knew intelligence never the methods of distribution to use it(all un..long,..Convene Skats,all un..long)..exactly why(all laugh..lot) and their beaus in reverse knows how to combine perception to decision but has absolutely no intelligence at all as to why to do that(all un..long,Guang and Gus..breezy flower dream,all un..).. that's why they succeeded to emulate the script their eldest two sinisters refuses existence hence could only simulate concensus not unanimity thus abjectly failed to separate themselves from situation as they were simulating experience not observation..that feeling(all un..,..Sensational Sinisters,all un..,Daisy and Violet un..)..man Zed said they needed to say you're my soul but soul is unanimous which they don't understand then consensus said you're after the whole yet is trapped as that being sole see for example not yourself(all un..,..Sensational Sinisters,all un..)..Convene Skats were intricately cunning thus always manipulated situations never the arising and setting of it thus none ever found them out of incisive darkness of content thus not sustainable as presence like the potential energy if becomes a rock..that subtle feeling of quality not necessity(all un..)..anyway these convene skats always lived with pokemons and met with the master brats at the forest then returned then went to pokemons to take completely unnecessary battering of psychic channels(all laugh..lot)..master brats lived in them these two menaces refused to live cause environment if mentioned becomes different to the precise reason why living has been introduced as existence, COUNTERING sustainability(all un..,..Convene Skats,all un..)..so these two always mingled with me whenever they didn't go to their instigators on weekends when Genkie and Blossie did and then went with pokemons and these two exchanged their places to sit on my head always (all laugh..lot)..then Weyo and Wij and Hemu and Hui were at Pewter with and Zee was working at the lab all of these brats all knew weren't at all sane(all laugh..lot)..then Weeky was working the academic side Margin conjoined Zee and him(all laugh..lot) Gladie was pampered to death by all of us sometimes grandma said don't give her so much indulgence we said she's the only direct disciple of Jubilee Hands-On even Zee said she only understood her roll in self if it's obvious only as being..existence Hands-On(all un..) but Gladie even learnt to look from him(all un..) so she deserves this as you know you have to deal with things if they are both possible only Hands-On(all un..)..who was running the lab then signing cheques and all already grandpa said those broad meetings were always with What-hum-headShool and True Vaccine alone(all un..long)..man they are indispensable to our self never being(all laugh..lot)..and no Stu McShin too always came here and The Feathered Ones always sat on his shoulders as the Convene Skats irritated him it was some scene cause none were allowed in the main section of field the playground of hideous dragons except Stu McShin with these menaces(all laugh..lot)..and Zee always sat on his head so he taught them literally showing pokemons and all who himself didn't know a damn thing about them only self only hence(all burst..)..no Jasu Sinclair was at Pasio maganing the two youngest sinisters who was pestered to death day and night and his beau is only Fantatina(all burst..)..she doesn't understand she's 45 now not 5 anymore(all laugh..lot)..so she was set upon by her hubby brat on MY perceptions(all laugh..lot)..no during Unova2 each brat called me each day including Doctor Slate who stayed the room beside that was all due to that hideous jackal(all laugh..lot,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)..no they always mingle in my life(all laugh..)..anyway,then Rita,Myla,Mava and Renee aunty were the ones who were running the lab but they were debarred from leaving Pallet as were all else Zed too didn't leave Pallet always rather used the Police as a communication channel the most ubiquitous thus the the most moral(all un..long,..Society,all un..long)..man for 21 long years being posted at Pallet Police Station was something else(all laugh..lot)..and then so many people always wanted to come hence i was made the

say like whose your bro,Column Jargon rhyming with Slalom Seldom are you sure you expected the answer to point to an individual being personally not professionally(all burst..,..The Feathered Ones,Genkai and Blossom un..)..first of all we were the simplest of beings as you see aunty how one of the most terrible menaces to logic like Jubilee Hands-On grasped her in the name of inheritance is beyond logical only existential comprehension(all laugh..lot)..that's exactly though what's Hands-On that is(all burst..)..so anyway we only could afford grass types and then because this was first a rebel of Frucifern Lab second is at Pallet is in-between Frucifern and Cerulean one the most uncooperative anyway other the most whimsical so it meant you'll run out of business definitely before your first anniversary plannings start(all laugh..lot)..so grandpa and grandma said we tell you Gary this sinister independent thought came to us that for the last resort in rhymes look to The Elusiveüêâ(all laugh..lot)..and then grandpa said all hell broke lose upon us(all laugh..lot)..firstly our staffs rejected us,secondly conglomerate denied entry of new staffs only volunteers,third Elite4 didn't pay us only directed conglomerate to supply resources according to their sanctions ofcourse never our needs(all laugh..lot),fourth Unova didn't recognize us hence each week there was a surveillance(all laugh..lot),fifth majority of champions and 1st nomination holders the very pioneers of the sanctions were the same people who were campaigning against us for abusing their bunches cause ofcourse we didn't have proper staffs(all laugh..lot)..then everyday there will be checkups by conglomerate this was quadruple checkup actually one cause Unova didn't recognize us so was on research and medicine test second conglomerate in order to protect customer pokemon rights checked the medicine test as well and the doctoring section then the small breeding we had only Sunfloras(all laugh..lot) was checked on behalf of Kanto Elite4 along with biology engineering as a whole(all laugh..lot)..then ofcourse because Frucifern felt threatened,Both Quaquaversal and Shamrockmoss objected to this as a Cerulean attempt to bring their name down(all laugh..lot) and Cerulean itself never listened to anyone cause they held a monopoly on the accumulated wealth no more ofcourse since Lexicon failed it's Referential purpose(all un..long,..Civilization,all un..long)..man when that brat invaded 11_City no matter Doctor Slate and his entourage it was just that the proper people were happy to live a better psychological life finally but the rest were as much incensed due to finances and rest but then to their utmost misfortune they were made the angels and saviours themselves against self as it doesn't exist other than a help to being..Hands-On(all un..,..Society,all un..) anyway then Cerulean didn't listen to anyone but the Smogon half of which belonged to them(all laugh..lot) they ordered for checking the refereeing section cause they thought we'll monopolize the whole training profession which actually Doctor Slate did away from 11 city circle being the secretary of..The ü¶ä of circumspection(all un..long,Tracey too un..)..this hideous ü¶ä took 17 years to turn-to-coat..the jackal of inspiration(all un..,Gladys..I'M the ü¶ä of facetious/being jackal of mysterious/look at my skills..i'm the Tracey of ambitious,all un..long,..Dr Jackal,all un..long,Tracey too un..)..man Melody saw him first time said um..bro can i bite him he disturbes me by being present(all un..long,..The ü¶ä of Forbearance,all un..long,Tracey too un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot),so we had whole world against us in the midst of all these we got so few pokemons and all some people did help Jerry uncle was ofcourse the only recognized trainer in our customer books the other being The Brawn Glenol who never left grandpa's side(all laugh..lot) and hence grandpa said well we had some solace cause Jerry uncle had a tremendous grass bunch our main objective and Brawn shifted his bunch to Yellowburst in protest so due to Jerry uncle still Frucifern was complaining against Elite4 for favouritism(all laugh..lot)..man grandpa said later they said so this is revenge completed isn't it,he said before me Niji said completion : the seclusion of competition(all un..long)..anything else on decision(all un..long,..Shadowy Lantern,all un..)..so no further progress was made(all laugh..lot)..this was when Niji was 4.25(all burst..)..anyway then these were 10 year long picture when finally we had to sell a plot a bait to any lowest league struggling trainer to to swallow it and be entangled in this eternal mess(all laugh..lot)..so grandpa said our hope was that the loan will never be re-payed(all laugh..lot),no sometimes grandma said no Gary don't go with them they can't even pay for their own release see these papers(all laugh..lot),i said this is why you see education is such a weapon if they can't understand what's written unless expressed in meaning of relativity never absolute here they can always question it's morality,countering the Ethical Honesty(all un..long)..anyhow(all laugh..lot) so now grandpa said uncle was invited to the 10 year celebration party that consisted of dad and mom's performance the major attraction(all laugh..lot),grandpa said they for some outrageous reason didn't want much in charges and all cause DaisyDevil was 1 then whose disposition as a 1 year old wasn't at all normal or sane(all laugh..lot,Hua&Wijdan..look stands a management bully..observing various reasons in methodically  construed hands/as that's the bully of character..with their explanations in constructive hand,all un..,..DaisyDevil,Daisy un..long)..so they decided to do some charity..NO IT'S INHUMAN(all un..long,Cedar and Gladys..The Insisted Ones,all un..long,Tracey and Daisy too un..long)..so(all laugh..lot) these were a lots of people at Pallet hence uncle too came but also with aunty(all laugh..lot)..they grandma said were were the most gullible people on earth(all burst..)..cause uncle only understood that pokemons needed care and grass types could be well controlled by his fires and he still had a Meganium of own and still a Moltres of all brats so why not(all laugh..lot)..well his bunch had Charmillion as starter then Meganium was his only non fire mate other grass was also fire by the name of Rotom his only psychic barring Moltres(all laugh..lot)..so he had in the first region Charmillion,Meganium,Rotom,Heatmore,Simisear,Flareon and Cinderace later had Moltres,Infernape and Talonflame so with 2 psychics with 1 pseudo legend and 9 total fires with 1 pure grass he had a tailor-made bunch for the ranging and servicing job here which only he understood all he was trying to find was a home for his looming family and aunty was a cook so that was bonus for us and she didn't understand anything at all about pokemons and all was 20 and 3 anyway with merely 6 month service as a cook at a mid price hotel at Levender the happiest city at Kanto from where she hailed from a low-middle class most common family(all laugh..lot)..anyway so they accepted but despite all cautioning uncle he stuck to this and aunty said i can't help this the people there i think are very good that's universalized though(all laugh..lot)..so then finally she settled down was expecting a kid grandpa and grandma said we too were happy they were doing so much work going to Frucifern and returning to work here lived there as well Jerry uncle came to know uncle said yeah a decent man a so-so trainer but is a far better breeder that too of fire types why Moltres came(all laugh..lot)..later the salvation of them from the other side and what sort of things these brats do these days is another universe entirely like,what can you do if we burn you two out,The Phantom of shout..shh..any expectations uncited throw the shadow of comprehension the most enlightened(all un..long,Daisy..Lastly The Playboy Lantern,all un..long)..man they said we stopped talking the same moment they started infighting with horrendous ideas that made absolutely no sense at all(all laugh..lot)..then we understood why the last 4 is always pushed at the front and the earliest 4 at the back cause there's no way you can penetrate someone like,Oh Living Hunter/Look Proven Painter(all un..long)/Oh Umpteen Discern/Hence now Refill Concern(all un..long)..that's simply impossible to manage dually(all laugh..lot)..certainly in reality too as that was corroborated in opposite by,liberation of soul/self and whole/through being the Light of sole look now fighting..alas observer your own the oven over another look lighting..anyway other not attented in the name of bother(all un..long,Bounty Bedlam,all un..long)..that's it for sanity(all laugh..log)..then in the middle you have Office Answer/Ah Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/Of Duality alas efforts don't fracture/as without meaning arcane anchor(all un..long)..that's impossible to move around in hence Team Sic and Plasma terribly failed to progress(all laugh..log)..they said we wanted to but that hinders our goal we found as it had some essence..the most pompous(all un..long)..then they said ok we could even eliminate Jubilee Hands-On via deceit may be taking whatever upon us a few were prepared they were maniacs but they were the first ones to ask the polices if they brought own water cause they looked tired they can take their time cause substance anyway unless pointed is left in random(all un..long)..so they said our obsession itself was channeled to Guzzle Humdrum the moment it understood that first time boomeranged to notion from conception and we could function cause you know we understood we're going to get the all pervading freedom that's not imputable as A Random Sojourn(all un..long)..besides they said he was 14ft 1,964 kgs man moves like 1ft 1.4 inch,9.64 kgs but as rolling on the ground of eloquence against self the performance(all un..long) if you point it out by touching him the mention of substance what can you do about it(all un..long)..and yeah they did hit him rolled around and excreted they said no hell could afford this mess out of a certainty thus his obsession with it's random variety never breaching the ethical honesty to help to the most generalized state and own foolishness as well as caution also against it too thus in circular countering..the most engulfing(all un..long)..they set fire on him said he removed his dress calmly while rolling but didn't remove it they said we saw the whole physique it was as if wanting so much more fire more pain we gave up man what if it was just a reflection as our anger told us how can i stop we automatically answered why ask just to be..countering(all un..long)..so they extinguished the fire instantly sprang up then tried to jump up then ofcourse couldn't was severely burnt yet all these were again deepened and the ofcourse couldn't talk either so still wanted to roll when all things were salvaged by those themselves with pokemons and all then went to hospital 7 days later completely healed said caution compeers..such a harrow such a preposition(all un..long)..then they realised this is a horrendous fool who doesn't change at all unless the counter finishes..just to be countering(all un..long)..Zed only said he will attempt these many times to see if he could bypass own created rules as he doesn't know what he is as a sentence for a change..just to be countering hence(all un..long)..but he was 4.5 then 16 days after this went for existential brat celebrations at Frucifern(all burst..)..and there after this whole situation people still objected to him who were told Fortitude..caution!(all un..long)..all were so frustrated with him but even in all they said far better than Lastly Phantom..first understand this next moment Phantom(all un..long)..and beside them there was like,Ei me me me me me me me me me/Hey Focal Bludgeon how to be(all un..long)..then finally they got the two baby Gyaradoses who they said were completely devoid of understanding thus we were so frustrated we told them we're going to kill you they said shut up you namecalls they're way better at continuation of craft rather that substraction of fact from generality not penetrability(all un..long,..WaterFire,all un..long)..they said we left our feelings for God's sake but felt this outstanding taste of coining : the feeling of best(all un..long,..Leading Crook,all un..long,Brock slaps..)..\"\nKunoichi..Stash,Weayaya,Haithem,Hua,Wijdan,Daisy,Gary and Lillie,Genkai and Blossom,Cuong and Poppy,Seth and Mehadi : \"NO Dialga don't be a gambler of essence(all un..long) just spin the meaning of cue(all un..long)/as just you've opened your eyes look i'm next to you(all un..long,Cuong and Poppy,Seth and Mehadi..Oh Pewter Hail The Feeling Due,all un..long,Brock too un..long)..\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"man that's another section of existense(all laugh..lot)..and all in the meantime Viol flower arrived at Cerulean whose disposition was the subsequent self dissent to DaisyDevil's specialization on general characters and this all happened while Doctor Slate was at Boulder who smiled at 1 week means he too feels that he is being helped here(all un..long,..That Feeling,Brock too un..)..so(all laugh..lot),no one of the staffs here told me we need a resume for Doctor Slate we can't just forward this name for a specialist position Gary i said write that this is the only person in last few millenias atleast who came to Boulder and managed it then managed a whole City then managed DaisyDevil of all outrageous characters(all laugh..lot) then played a parallel game of correlation with Viol flower of all unstable creatures(all laugh..lot),then first was the very person whose 7.5 year long journey created a completely new paradigm of training that's never been seen in alteast last 1000 years if not 10000 as you know it just(all un..,..Master Brats)..exactly why(all laugh..lot) and for a certificate he was the helper to the style DaisyDevil developed where even a shadow Watergun could be so so difficult to pull off(all laugh..lot)..if someone pulls that off that's 1st nomination by all means and you can leave the profession after this cause you can't win one damn match after a point if your bunch knows so much about characters of anything(all laugh..lot)..unless they're used by Convene Skats ofcourse they aren't present in the books anyway(all laugh..lot)..or Gladly Syndrome cause unless you battle she'll do it herself then ofcourse there's the Feathered Ones who never needed their bunches neither did they need them hence too much bonhomie(all laugh..lot)..except that this bunch isn't of any use barring the very last round of the day how Baby Gyarados and Incentive Overdose when present used them but that was all due to their own styles of absolutely headless chicken approaches cause they refused to analyze anything(all laugh..lot,Gus and Guang..Young Flower Gleam,Mehadi and Poppy laugh..lot)..so no wonder they were abjectly played by Tyranitar of all horrendously foolish brats(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Doctor Slate revolutionized education for advanced aptitude holders removing 3 years before 17 so by the time they were 14 they held a masters in Philosophy which only was a lexicon to their own feelings as ever they never needed anything rather the viseversa(all laugh..lot) but these all achievements of Doctor Slate was paled when he certified all these 7 described menaces to be fit for profession but that was surpassed the very next day when he alone of all people opined that master brats be licensed to service pokemons professionally that day Dennis said will be remembered when hell and heaven rejected us simultaneously(all burst..,Cedar..Jubilee Hands-On,all un..)..yeah exactly why(all laugh..lot)..anyway then this he did only because he lead a gym for a year that too ground/rock/steel at Boulder!Boulder!(all laugh..lot,..Dashing Rock,all laugh..lot,Brock slaps..)..then still after this he managed the marriages of Incentive Overdose and Baby Gyarados(all laugh..lot)..then was the sole selected trustee to the architecture of awakening PANGORO(all laugh..lot)..then he managed the record of never winning a round something Drew aspired so much said how can you surpass this man huh how hum..look this is a bit shrew thus only to probabilities i can say look i only Drew(all un..long,Gus..Education,all un..long)..man 3 straight regions that two twice second time 2 total 5 for God's sake after merely qualyfing for the first and last two after 1 individual title against Chongie of all time greats before(all laugh..lot)..May said i told him so many times at Johto why do you follow me still hum(all burst..),said no sweetie didn't we agree to phenomena say look to the number that look we only Drew(all un..long,Gus..Culture,all un..long)..man what a sample was hand-made by what sort of a similar sample(all laugh..lot)..Combu is just an eversweet being unlike Lady Dawn ofcourse or Senor they're very similar characters from two opposing ways(all laugh..lot..)..anyway then still Doctor Slate returned and led his gym for 2 more years establishing after his first tenure how to handle battles to now how to shaoe every field of training and managing in the profession and he encouraged almost everyone to become a trainer triggering a very deep financial crisis which DoDo NotSoSure handled by this exact method(all un..lot)..man it was something our relationship with And again Drew(all un..long)..Drew and he always got on well obviously from name to antics to everything and Mella aunty was similarly sweet and simple yet had outrageous ways towards view of existence as much as Combu(all laugh..lot)..i demand an apology,indeed Sir from the wisdom of possible blue corner Mr Hummm-Bertoooo RUOUGH-ON-STAT(all un..long)..that was it for 8,8 now he is still unhappy with our approach to physical education(all burst..),anyway(all laugh..lot) then Doctor Slate managed 8,8 as well while doing breeding and medicine testing sending the brats plane agnostic out of limits of glee i told Melody in rhymes hence she knew that they've failed after a year(all laugh..lot)..anyway then then next 3 regions Doctor Slate finally chose the doctor studies while managing Combu her Baby Pest and her Shrew(all laugh..lot) while instigating the current top echelon of trainers and gym leaders and co-ordinators then finally i said this all was combined in his last project undertaken as the chief executive that is Lady Dawn Baby Dawnny(all laugh..lot)..that isn't happening again anyway so write these rather than his qualifications as a resume then Zed said well i was staying silent at Boulder enjoying their works when this very MAN said,no Dialga don't be a gambler..as you see what you see/cause unless you understand this feeling,you will catch the feeling of that cold ME(all un..long,Lillie..OH Boulder Has Come that Leading Plea,all un..,Brock slaps..)..so Zed said i knew ok atleast there are enough people ready made for sharing my feelings(all burst..)..then he met first Weyo and Hemu then DaisyDevil,Viol flower and Lil later said then i knew there were too many of them(all laugh..lot)..no first time he went out of home or lab was straight to Boulder!Boulder!(all laugh..lot,Brock shakes..lot)..anyway then this time he has the distinction of the only man who stood against the Convene Skats in a publicly declared dissent which he himself later described the nuances of(all un..,Poppy and Mehadi..Dashing Crook,all un..,Brock too un..) then this man was the one who deepened the drama of these 4 baby menaces to relationships then still afterall the very greatest achievement of this man is not doing or feeling but being selected by the jackal of notion as sparring partner(all un..,Brock and Tracey un..)..\"\nLillie(fits..laughter) : \"Oh Dr Dr don't you feel we're only observing this sign(all un..long)/as the feeling of mine in processes chime(all un..long)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"anyway(all laugh..lot),so amidst all this Rita,Mala,Mava and Renee aunty came in they said yeah uncle was doing well working hard aunty was expecting their future a nice own home a nice job a perfect low-middle class family now with so much hope and pleasure expecting their first child which as destiny could never reason why only existense as it's so thus came to them existentially Jubilee Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..then grandma said it was as normal waiting time nothing special exactly as later for master brats they always walk within self never detected in being hence(all laugh..lot)..anyway then on-birth doctors said absolutely no reaction and after much attempt he finally cried with a even more deep smile in face clearly indicating smile or lamenting was only so Hands-On(all burst..) then ofcourse proper people were asked and all they only said it's anything as a thing Hands-On enjoy the ride(all burst..)..then by the time he was 3 he grew up to be 7 ft 4,126 kg no fat never any muscle all there is what is deemed already countering Hands-On meaning just ready(all un..long)..so(all laugh..lot) then with these features Hunnie and Roy said we wanted to be scared but the whole existence is rather neutralizing Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..later Kuchi,Pillie,Ojo,Omu,Usi,Liro,Lixue and Niji checked in at 7ft 8 with 142 kgs and their total 8 versioning adversaries 7ft11 with 153 kgs at the age of 3.5 no progress if born(all burst..)..then still it wasn't 3.5 with 964 Kg of 14ft1 that's vulture business by all means(all laugh..lot)..954 kgs and 12ft7 in 27 months how's that for growth rate(all laugh..lot) rest did it with only similar heights that is still 4ft 9inches shorter atleast mind the number first then the difference countering(all burst..)..well Omu,Ojo,Liro,Pillie,Kuchi,Usi,Lixue and Niji are such gigantic physically yet to their baby brat they look so much smaller by 5ft 2inches and ofcouse 773 kgs(all laugh..lot) and their versioning issues 753 kgs with 4ft 9 inch(all laugh..lot) well anyone would be like that(all laugh..lot) and aunty then was just 5ft7 with 61 kgs at the age of 31.75(all laugh..lot)..so Guzzle Humdrum was more than 16 times heavier and 2.5 times taller to her at the age of 3.5(all laugh..lot)..that was some sight man like Tyranitar(all laugh..lot)..this is just the feature the most insignificant part of the master brats(all laugh..lot)..then he lost 864 kgs of that and was just 100 at Unova aunty said still 36 kgs heavier to me don't bother(all laugh..lot)..864 kg weight loss in 6 months imagine that for start then growth as well COUNTERING(all laugh..lot)..then picked it up in 25 days that's the most insane thing 34 kg food/day(all laugh..lot)..said i'll need to be RELEASED in nature to live why what's surprising(all un..long)..as the rest struggle against nature but for the master brats growth being natural to the idea of survival struggles to define them physically as specified(all un..)..they said no you're unwell still cause you're 14ft1 not 1ft6 anymore to achieve that feat look at this mirror(all un..),you mean physical one(all un..long),then said this is strange compeers this idea of struggle as you can only control how well you do it yet limit your availability in the name of mathematics to intellectual ravel,creatures(all un..long)..then they said no you've been vetoed against departing along with your compeers of arms by emotion(all laugh..lot),against wandering into logic from rationality for self ego's peripheral caution..shh..the most inciting(all un..long)..anyway then they said so you also should bear with our foolhardy and eat these things,this is astonishing compeer why you'd put so much effort to diversify food in need of molecules and else only in the name of hunger to conflate all of these..shh..the most painstaking(all un..long) then they said still you should be moral because before you couldn't talk hence we didn't know(all burst..),but also due to effort you should be re-payed compeers survival the most collective in effort by sharing the gross insuring the abstract of own(all un..)..shh..physics deems in abstract the most elastic(all un..long),so then he insisted that the staffs and all eat that but then obviously Dashing Crook was there to cook this situation(all laugh..lot)..so he was brought in all food were eaten together almost(all burst..) then Crook was kept there to crook 51 kg/day for 25 days which only Leading Crooks can manage in a hospital while entertaining all the others(all laugh..lot,..That Feeling,all laugh..lot,Brock shakes..)..then aunty was there to tackle Jubilee Hands-On none else could tackle Jubilee if so only Hands-On COUNTERING lexicon(all un..,Cedar..Gladie he said Hakamo-O you hear it everyday first hand it's Hakamo-O ok Hakamo-O,all un..long,Cedar..huh why don't you parse it with your complexity theories hum,all un..long,Cedar..Hakamo-the fightiiiin'-OOhhh,all un..long,Cedar..Compendium,all un..)..anyhow(all laugh..lot)..and it's cause only those two refuse to be cooked their meals unless the mentioned people unless invited or asked and Dr Jackal isn't in the list for Stashey cause he can only observe half the days(all burst..,Tracey and Daisy un..)..and Cili is spared and most revered as a servant of the Elusiveüêâ(all burst..)..Mulu himself won't go,um..but Poppy will stay here that's not moral is it if i leave like when i cook i don't give enough salt cause I'm treating a patient and then later tell the person not from the very beginning as a reaction to later surprise or accident rather than an introduction to those then why survival is all about that being preset(all un..)..Stashey boy only accepted either the Crook or Mulu in that way like he'd just turn up and demand(all laugh..lot)..aunty was always refused by him no protection if born(all laugh..lot)..rest of the master brats never ask for food(all laugh..lot)..and Jubilee Hands-On refuses absolutely everyone barring aunty(all laugh..lot)..he does demand like Stashey but only from aunty and no it's like whatever you have which Stashey asks from Mulu but only Leading Crooks can provide abundant food hence Stashey always demanded that from him obviously not always enough(laughing..) Physical Food(all un..long)..anyway(all burst..)..so then it was literally Eat-Sleep-Wake Up-Repeat never excrete(all laugh..lot)..and didn't speak either ate and slept that's it like a newborn(all laugh..lot)..so yeah from the next day of this setup from 100 to 114 then said yeah satisfying situation(all burst..) then next day 148 then 182 to 214 in three days weight gain of which the first 14 kgs just to validate the system(all burst..),so in 4 days went past his eldest cousin brats too same proportions as his own bros(all laugh..lot)..of lexicon(all un..long)..anyway(all burst..),obviously PHYSICALLY so the going past cause none considers any of them or their sisters in any gender(all laugh..log)..and yeah 214 was 3 kgs more than his own clan's atmost weight(all laugh..lot)..then still a few doctors say still no way he can keep it up for 25 days barring the starting day so on 21st after 3 weeks was 828 kgs(all laugh..lot)..then they said we bet it'll take 26 days(all burst..) on 23rd was 896(all laugh..lot)..they ofcourse kept him in a bed able to hold 14ft1 inch 964 kgs from the beginning(all laugh..lot)..the  the doctors said we still were hopeful that like 963 capped him too come on man atleast 100 grams we'll take(all burst..)..then next day exact 930 doctors said we never were this tense even doing an operation cause we never betted against the patient just to Guzzle the death as Humdrum(all un..)..next day exact 964(all laugh..lot)..next day woke up Crook knew it so knew like anything either it's self Guzzle or another Humdrum(all un..long)..so,prepared the full food(all laugh..lot)..so then all were fed and all the staffs though never patients for honesty in due morality(all un..)..and a lot went to the city council as well 51 kg salads alone is something itself(all laugh..lot)..crook knew the other stuffs so last day kept only 1 kg salads rest normal food and as usual next day woke up and said no won't eat anymore in next 24 hours which in which he didn't say anything but sat on the floor or on the bed doing the direct hand-combat stances and feet movements or if on the floor not doing anything but his eyes were always open as he throughout was WOKEN(all laugh..lot)..after that mingled with a few Reuniclases that were there so 1.5 hour mandatory psychic sleep induced by unknown brats atleast this time were trained and alos not forsaken or abused of swelled up after that(all laugh..lot)..so after that like 30 hours was alright but the Reuniclases were too happy hence in their place entered a Hospital two most evolved Zekroms who faced some horrible esoteric legends last time(all laugh..lot) they served for the few Reuniclases while pointing out when the nurses and doctors weren't mindful or the patient was losing hope as part of moral ethics for them(all un..long)..and thus was done by pulling the Doctors' hairs or ears for the patients reaction and for their own their noses were squeezed(all un..)..and this code obviously was given by Humdrum so that they could Guzzle everything(all un..long)..after this mayhem they said this brat is definitely inhuman exactly as his two terrible lackeys(all laugh...lot)..then said no wonder the latest two Gyaradoses horribly failed to understand Unova as they refuse to analyze anything and this situation will horribly deepen if you presume and predict only that too clinically exactly why they lack any sort of intelligence(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Jubilee Hands-On debuted Roy(->Jay->Cherruvue Slate) and Hunnie went to him the last day of first month of school he only sat there the first day none believed he wasn't 300(all laugh..lot) then went there throughout the month to learn how to write sentences and ofcourse to the gym(all laugh..lot)..then last day Roy and Hunnie went to him they said we undertood what he was saying but couldn't reciprocate so asked him being where he may be found said at this gym itself is where he will come everyday weekend at afternoon(all laugh..lot)..so they met him next time then said we didn't understand why all were so inconvenient with him he seemed far more normal than them(all laugh..lot,..Choiced Brats)..what else(all laugh..lot)..anyway then he learnt the few exercises and throughout the first year he traveled through Pallet next year only after the Levender Saga did he turn up at the lab but by then all knew him like Lance and rest(all laugh..lot) but with Pokemons he was way more comfortable it was seen and after he entered the business at 4 year old he  throughout changed the whole picture cause by then the authority knew about him they couldn't go through the eye of honesty merely morality thus never ethics(all laugh..lot)..then grandma said this brat wanted all sorts of lexicons only he never read anything only heard where he applied the lexicon like if it was a lexicon on inferential statistics he'll read that first then go to listen to it thus he knew the meaning but never the sentences countering Hands-On(all un..,..Jubilee Hands-On)..anyway(all laugh..lot),then he was virtually running the lab by the time he was 4.5 and people sent pokemons cause by then Doctor Slate was 9.5 too at university finally meaning Pewter was in a very deep water Cerulean dual fire of emotional schooling and characteristic universalism(all laugh..lot)..so there were people who sent their dragonic menaces there and later other types of brats came too and there were so many brats 5 times more than the space could afford yet all were very cooperative among themselves for some reason that was all because first they were to travel with the lexical bushrangers intellectually(all burst..) secondly cause of the innumerable Decidueyes that used to circle Pallet(all laugh..lot)..and you may be pseudo-legend dragon but you don't cross Decidueyes that easily none wants to prey ghosts no matter for the same fear that the master brats have been spared what if afterwards..(all burst..)..the reality is that they're most irritating never intruding unlike master brats(all laugh..lot) and their disciples are like Decidueyes too except exactly ME(all laugh..lot,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)..no they poke my life always(all laugh..lot)..and yeah wherever Zed went a few Decidueyes was always with him atleast 5/6 will always be there at lab and Pallet atleast 100 definitely were there(all laugh..lot)..and these just the full evolved in total with the baby Rowlets there were may be 400(all laugh..lot)..conglomerate objected vehemently but was turned away to possibilities ethically given their position which they found some illegal encroachment at Rimsable-Shamrockmoss-Kitesky-Frucifern line hence they understood this brat is insurmountable psychophysically as it's only available to the brat Hands-On(all burst..)..and Weyo and Hemu never left Pallet till 9.5 from 5.5 after dropping out of Cerulean(all laugh..lot) and then never left the field even since they turned 7(all burst..)..and they brought Weeky with them too from school before that no response at all just normal visitor once smelt the similar sort of brathood jumped in thankfully not with a least evolved Marill(all laugh..lot,Tracey bursts..)..anyway then amidst all these the Ransei saga took place Margin and Gladie came and then debuted the Master Brats 16 with Guzzle Humdrum none of whom anyone knew why came here certainly destiny didn't only existence like Hands-On and especially Guzzle Humdrum how can someone named Guzzle Humdrum be even born and if born make any progress as that's Pro of Grace, that's deemed as countering(all un..long)..they weren't much responding before they went to school cause they had their own preparations but once they debuted Zed didn't do anything much later he only authorized Kimmie the Master Brats took over after that but only when they were 4 other people except aunty understood the middling ones weren't only a surprise in terms of ideas and all but they had an extremely meaning-agnostic language scheme especially the baby one as well 5 years later it was found out that the baby brat is the epitome of a Playboy 6 years after that it became a rogue(all laugh..lot)..then another of his gang never needed any changes since 3.25(all laugh..lot) only the language became all full of allegories later as aunty said i have no idea who told her a ghost story (all un..long) said till then wasn't that talkative like Ash then suddenly i was reading the paper one day she came in saw it and starting dancing around in direct hand combat stance obviously that's the only dance they know like..\nhazy hazy..require..jab(all un..long)/thoughtful thoughtful..discursive mind look memory gyre..run(all un..long,..Master Brats,all un..long),man Mr Tegfage our trainer said if they got into this we all would've found something else to do next day(all laugh..lot)..and all tried this against Kumlie he said each time failed cause when i told Pedal Ponder first understand what i just said(all un..long) that i wasn't all chaste she said the same thing which aunty told that she at 3.25 came in aunty was reading a newspaper while taking her breakfast suddenly aunty says i didn't notice her but suddenly hear a thunderous roar with those moves saying..\nHIT-MON-CHAN(all un..long)..\nOh look Fast Tiffin Concur/Else Look Oh Despite Break Resumption of Temporality's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..aunty said i was so scared(all burst..) and Kumlie said after this added thus oh My Valour or Sweet Tender/look beauty own perfection's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/thus oh my illusive bender/let's now Pedal Ponder(all un..long)..so Kumlie said i heard this in a crematorium man what if this very brat..(all un..long)..he said before that i thought them as bros and sisters still after this knew classifications could never find Master Brats how can you comprehend a group called Master Brats(all laugh..lot)..man people were so so scared with Coffin Saunter but then she revealed \nFast closes Lunch hour/emotions Pedal Ponder(all un..long,Cedar..To Work is Looking Vendor/Needy Hurry Pedal Ponder/else Look Regret's Coffin Saunter,all un..long)..man this menace isn't available before a few millenias definitely(all laugh..lot) actually other dimensions read her stories only now still people don't believe Ash is alive or Omu's birth certificate isn't fake(all un..long)..and for the fact Oumou means 'mother'(all un..)..like,Baby also mommy Pedal Ponder/Else also Mommy Attachment's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..man what sort of brat this is for own physical form and the opposite too or any other(all laugh..lot)..and yet they can't brood over it as \nlook self Phantom Phantom this ego..else being Coffin saw Saunter(all un..long)/That pedal pondering to one else my ness now looking at me the you of i Oh Phantom(all un..long,Daisy..Attention!Missing!Lastly A Coffin Phantom!,all un..long)..man Juritared and Kitesky didn't know what to do with Lastly Phantom and someone named Pedal Ponder what can you do about them cause of how itself in reflection..oh thus Pedal Ponder/else how's entailing and rhetoric thus's discrete Phantom Saunter(all un..long,Daisy..Lastly the Playboy Vendor,all un..)..yeah absolutely so(all laugh..lot).. what's your name Ms Ketchum,8,8,Hall of Fame, that's the address of the name,but that's what the name has to claim isn't it insert anything thus else look Ordered Tiffin Confusion/as event for Coffin Confession(all un..long)..finally 3 years after that the real Ashey boy debuted and all realized Ash Ketchum, Lastly Phantom the Playboy the Rogue all were the veils to the real brat that is never there all were absolutely petrified to come in the path of this brat cause they knew they were searching for shadows which if they understood they were exposed to another nightmare to rationality the next version(all laugh..lot,..Shadowy Lantern,all laugh..lot)..the earliest version of this grouping was always too restless to understanding the latest too agnostic(all laugh..lot) and the other version all of us knew isn't at all good(all laugh..lot)..he instigated purest desperation in anyone his versioning from his earlier version's despair(all laugh..lot)..then fear then the path of conserving inbounding or abject mortification(all laugh..lot)..next finally was the disintegration hence all were always irritated by the very thought or sight(all laugh..lot,..Guzzle Humdrum,all un..)..what else is expected from a menace named so(all laugh..lot).. sometimes gradma said no Gary don't go with any of them barring Stashey he's more understanding you know(laughing..) of life's reality(all un..long)..i said do you even understand the job of the latest version this menace isn't mingled with even by his own versions he appears to be easiest to deal with cause he's waiting for this moment for all the life..oh lord..oh Vultures re-cord(all un..long,..Guzzle Humdrum,all un..)..so anyway rest didn't care much about Guzzle Humdrum they knew you didn't have to sadly none else did despite the warning Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..their two Disciples knew it hence didn't say much rest Margin and Gladie the same The Feathered Ones looked after all as many generations later grandchildren(all laugh..lot) because they always mingled exactly ME in their absolutely self created cauldrons which the baby disciple imitates the most still(all laugh..lot)\"\nGenkai(laughing..) : \"Eii!Gary..give me that give mm..Hush Now oh Mr(all un..long) Mr Oak(all un..long)/did give ask or you..thus just Dr Oak(all un..long,..Pallet Hush,all un..long)\"\nBlossom(laughing..) : \"no we need to be registered as married not couple(all un..,..The Feathered Ones,all un..long)because it's a habitual annotation not effective concentration(all un..long)..we don't understand any of these we being the Police can't..Hush now oh Being..did honesty you your morality poke(all un..)/thus won't said ethics can't you..hence write there the Witness is,or Is done by,but also as the,witnessing is done by Dr Oak(all un..long,Cedar,Brock&Tracey..yeah these are your stamps..Dr or Mrs..no no no no no as stamp is to make signature poke,all un..,Violet and Daisy..change it to Professional Dr or Personal Mrs is personalized or professionalized as Gary or-never and-Lillie Oak,all un..long,..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long,Gary and Lillie un..)\"\n\n\nso then finally amidst all this Jubilee Hands-On silently debuted in physique human though for some strange reason again impossible only never to existense cause that's only Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..anyway then first of all after two years as Zed is born suddenly grandma said one day 2 boys came with a lady who even then was drunk and was enfeebled and all but anyway they come in from Cerulean want to meet aunty so grandma said i was a bit cautions so asked them of things the lady wasn't listening and all so shouted and all but these two boys one handled her another looked at me with a look that told me he knows me forever but doesn't know himself,countering(all un..long,Cedar..hallow bro i'm Ciddy, referring..Namely Fulcrum,all un..long)..so i was a bit cautious as to from which addiction centre he's from but this very word ridiculed me saying addiction : the pivot of beginning(all un..long)..and he was 112 inches 211 kg same as his twin an extremely agile heavyweight in direct hand combat(all laugh..lot)..their later physically born younger brats(all laugh\n..lot) were 191 kg with 8ft11 inch exactly as the comprehensive shore of the master brats(all laugh..lot)..the generative shore was 5 inches taller and 20 kgs heavier still(all laugh..lot)..and once i saw Nihu was suddenly hit a bit harder by Jingie the Jangomo-O mistaking him for someone else who came and picked him like like a newbron and put him aside for treatment and nonchalantly went onto spar with a pseudo-legendary FIGHTING dragon cause he was 14ft 1,964 kgs at 3.5 already(all laugh..lot)..so was like more than 4.5 times heavier and 4ft 9 inches taller still(all laugh..lot)..i still remember a few days after full physique this brat i came across sadly at night(all laugh..lot),said dreaming Gary is only the confirmation of possibilities isn't it recursively not realistically the most conserving this desire with self isn't it(all un..long)..i said what does that have to do with your growth i wonder,growth : the pendulum of perception Gary..shh..the most covariant(all un..long,..Guzzle Humdrum,all un..),so somehow escaped this menace for a few hours of dreams literally too countering(all burst..)..man Lil is 6 ft 4 and 79 kgs and she looks like a just born to him 7ft 9 inches shorter 885 kgs lighter(all laugh..lot)..and for all that proportion this menace moves around still like 1.69 feets and 9.64 kgs(all laugh..lot) if does physically that is(all burst..)..and no a few hit him in the gym still(all laugh..lot)..yeah they said we used metals to protect us(all laugh..lot) they said this brat put us up took the blows straight at the chin twice put us down then rolled around the whole floor in too much glee(all burst..)..singing..\nTwinkle twinkle little üåü/spontaneous I only comes so far(all un..long)/thus after life oh self regale your me/else shadows of random won't tangle my me(all un..long)..oh practice practice hence now you loom/metaphysics real I..boom(all un..long)..Guzzle Humdrum of Genetic Star/Cosmos on-to logy why you nuzzle afar(all un..long)/Verily I've come to spar/I the me of..caution my your soul ajar(all un..long)..Humdrum Humdrum Guzzle thus/if not absolute why ask what is what(all un..long,Violet..i if you feel alone and mentally feeling an elusive bar/me oh observing exclaim my from space not near of far/seeing the goal preset of being without rationality's arrear/self thus welcome to the most ensuing Vulture Frontier,all un..long,..The Vulture Frontier,all un..long)",

    "body": "Dawn(laughing..) : \"so yeah i had 44 brats who caught me at the very start(all laugh..lot)..and Cobbie came the 3rd month barring the starting one(all laugh)..and he came along with Celesteela in a group first ever 2 catches(all burst..) from same valley(all burst..) next group was Terrakion and Aerodactyl from same valley again anything else(all laugh..lot)..and this was capped off by GARCHOMP(all un..)..whole of next day i was unconscious yet understood how Chumpie was mingling in my concepts of personal life(all un..) so woke up next day then the day after that was with her next day kicked out to get a Kaledo time now Phantom(all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) in my 2nd month from start i was with 5 pseudo-legends and my starter without a single gym,cup or contest entry 2 months into my VERY first journey(all laugh..lot)..and i was the greatest sacrificial lamb to this impossible and inhuman scheme never mentioned to me(all laugh..lot)..so next month i knew i'll do the cup against my desire to become a co-ordinator anyway i was thinking just one off next League absolutely Phantom(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) then i get into the cup and all break this news i was so angry and frustrated and afraid and felt cheated and all i dialled the Police straightaway on charge of abduction in front of a BoD cup all looked at me definitely as Phantom(all un..)..anyway first ever cup with 6 pseudo-legends and yeah a ground cup had to be with the Leading Rock organising my beheading(all laugh..lot)..so no wonder i failed so so miserably after Unovan bushes began(all laugh..lot)..man i still thank DESTINY so much that it saved my poor Zekrom from horrendous fellow menaces like Zeky Ketchum(all laugh..lot,Glayds,Genkai and Blossom,Gus and Guang and this is your CUMULATIVE contribution to their lives,all un..,Cilan too un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot),so after i enter my first contest with Cobalion,Terrakion,Aerodactyl,Celesteela,Garchomp and Empol ofcourse with Kaledo,Silvally and lastly Urshifu having just come 5 days before(all laugh..lot)..settled on 3nd last day next day i had time with her but the day after i was forced to  anesthesia and woke up at the facilitation for my first contest with the Leading Crook saying in front of everyone..\nwake up..wake up..oh my baby wake up)/emotion, excitement..oh let my baby intellect in self wake up(all un..,..Dashing Leading Rock,all un..),while moving a sandwich in front of my face(all un..)..this was the simulation of physical paralysis with ensuing physical danger from a public execution being tormented with food after starvation hence that song on self intellect(all un..,Genkai and Blossom,Guang,Gus..Dialga don't be a gambler just let you get this feeling soaked,all un..,as you understand you're soaking can you feel your self without being now going broke,all un..,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja&Stash..Oh The Dagger of life now face this Boulder look has come the Dashing Cloak,all un..,May..good morning Brock,have you felt that mental morning is not only in your being that the biological clock now having enough to let also your emotions to get soaked,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot),this was the very start then i woke up and was so angry and frustrated and all exactly when i realized this whole situation hence calmed down a bit preparing my logic of namecalling(all laugh..lot)..yeah that is spontaneous hence must be logical else next flight goodbye with a just caught Elusiveüêâ(all un..,David and Sirichai..Dark Nights with Brat Ketchums,all un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot),then i get in having known that i was this great sacrifice for the embodiment of The Elusiveüêâ(all laugh..)..no a few did complain exactly this hence some counsellors came after my Frontier win saying congrats Dawn but life is so enjoyable you know not always so destiny driven(all un..),i just told them to put a translator in none found them again at their personality or profession it's heard cause of the art of starvation(all un..) anyway then first of all there's this huge official furore on abuse and abduction cause none knew my whereabouts for 2 months barring Professor Kukui who ofcourse refused to divulge it(all laugh..lot)..and yeah this reminds me what happened at Birch labs when Max joined Oak Labs and i recall this cause this utter pest was the only one whom i could relate to the most there and still he's 6 long years older to me(all laugh..lot)..\"\nMax(laughing..) : \"well the Sinnoh entourage was certainly something unveiling Project Baby Dawn(all laugh..lot)..and we were kept in dark then Brock returns too happy says finally we found the embodiment of the whole WaterFire clan(all laugh..lot)..then ofcourse the 4th version was present with us(all laugh..lot),she certified the same but then wanted to fondle her too much that's Poppy flower ofcourse(all laugh..lot) which she was denied the rights of after mingling DaisyDevil into it when Dawnny was tricked to say how she was so proud to meet her hearing her fortitude against the personal life difficulties since her TRAVELING days(all burst..),this completely set her off on Colony Monogram who as usual only thickened it(all laugh..lot)..and Dawnny was made to listen to this to test if she could mingle Viol flower's emotional intelligence into the Characteristics of DaisyDevil(all laugh..lot)..which she did by advocating for what she wanted to do herself which she expected from us and all while disparaging our characters viciously but then was again tricked into insinuating about Discuss hence the original WaterFire viciously jumped her(all laugh..lot),no it was a literal melee we understood time could never separate these two(all laugh..lot) and the sort of language they were using and all thoroughly scanned Dawnny's particular existence and initiated the Project Baby Dawn(all laugh..lot)..which again the 4th version of the flower along with judgement by Lillie flower(all laugh..lot,..Lillie flower) there when asked of any objections vehemently criticised the Master Brats for denying full enshrinement of personal minuteness in the name of characters(all un..)..later during Unova and subsequent when Dawnny wasn't LIKING us(all laugh..lot) then ofcourse Master Brats will always go after you no matter where you are as you know Poppy says that even Mrs Chansbert said this is unethical practice out of institutionalization this is inhuman(all burst..) but anyhow these all actually proved that how Project Baby Dawn was actually always there it's just that existence always colludes with Master Brats against comprehension(all laugh..lot)..no man the things Dawnny had to go through was absolutely 2 whole careers fused in one in one journey the very first the only reason was that she couldn't do Unova right after her physique would've given up hence was debarred and then the rest is just what it is explicable never comprehensive just as that 5 year long darkened drama just to be countering(all laugh..lot)..anyway when i joined the Oak Labs,all everywhere disparaged all that's my,countering hallow never hi hence themselves fell silent when they had to choose between welcome or bye.. analysis look causality now Phantom(all un..)..so i just sent a report how many from even Pasio our most staunch opponents holistic is producing these great results and all and neither Dr Oak nor Lillie flower the owners anyway don't need any money to start with i said how can you claim anything as your own if your name is like Lillie flower(all laugh..lot).. it's impossible to live in things hence it's just the pieces of existential puzzle for each them and others too nothing else(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well about these nuances of the project Mango told me Dr Jackal and DaisyDevil suddenly put our elusive passing bar of dual ethics to rank impossibility now being too happy finding similar sort of beings(all laugh..lot)..said we only knew how you were this millenial being here to relief potential from procedure no wonder you went to the bushes without a Venonat(all un..)..anyway then my first cup there was this huge furore none in the world supported this scheme this time even Gemmie,Oskie and Penny abstained from voting forcing their beaus to the same and jointly cited the reason being personal inabilities in professionalized rather than applicable psychology of perception(all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) all past and current vetoed to stop it including Sakura and all barring Snorie,Slirrie,Redzie,Centie and Putu ofcourse they are never allowed to vote anyway cause it biases the outcome(all laugh..lot)..Dave and Irissalad doesn't understand the need for any voting cause optionality is just the Humdrum of presence they say(all un..),thankfully Mummy and Sruzie then Percy and Manthie and even Gabriel and Mateo they are a bit more sane(all laugh..lot) so all were against Master Brats except ofcourse Marc the Mr Litman no reasons needed(all un..,Iris..no Iris don't tell them that they did a commendable job tell them they did a equitable job as else it'll only make them egotistical not enthused to the cause of their expectations on self satiation..once my Breedril not doing thus failed to win a round hence i thought this,all un..,..Marc the Mr Litman,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot),he said his Oricorio once in a round asked him if he should listen to him or remember his teaching(all un..long time),to which i answered(all un..),the belief compeer else you get my intention not what my analysis tells me and thus how i intend to use it to get my intention thus you unless see my beliefs can only get what i desire not behind them what are my feelings(all un..long time) hence this being should be allowed to undertake these ideas else can't know if they were mere beliefs of being or belief itself in it's own being becoming the self-that feeling(all un..long time)..so this supported the crook as well who actually is the founder of these sort of training methods that his direct disciples got by the feelinng apprantly by their own actually just a mockery of what as another can be known(all laugh..lot)..anyway,then all there at the cup says your first brat will be Garchomp if you can't win one round with her you're going to jail for using substances(all laugh..lot),i was groomed to say no this is unfair but now remembered my teaching of saying to add-\njail : the defection of analogy from useful activity to  insightful productivity,countering necessary : the usefulness of necessity(all un..long time),so now i had to look at their belief in itself that's this meaning to add with else you'll be jailed-the most entailing(all un..long time),so i said if i win one I'll change him no matter she being my last brat cause every round is deemed discrete in self which you've not specified(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,Dawn un..)..\"\nMay(laughing..) : \"well Max said um..hey May if you were asked to validate yourself and you didn't agree to them did you start with saying this idea that has invaded your mentality and ended with hence you see mentality is a general term only that's unbiased thanks(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,Dawn un..)..i said may be when it was mom or dad(all burst..),um..no Mr Lubos was very scared with all this on being questioned Dawnny started with how she felt her behaviour is analyzed not due to what she was questioned but how she answered it(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..,Dawn too un..) and ended with hence i demand acknowledgement of my desire behind my motivations not whether or how i achieve it(all un..) then ended with my my my what a pleasure for thy only to derive in place of intelligible hallow a reactive hi i DEMAND freedom of what i'm taught for which I've been given a license now that how i apply ok(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..,Dawn un..)\"\nGus(laughing..) : \"yeah Dawnny always used this phrase i just convoluted it with experience(all burst..,Dawn un..)..man as much calm and methodical Combu and her rose were baby Dawnny exceeded everything(all laugh..lot)..we met her first and was thinking how has this sample been able to camouflage the existential self so well found out it was just behavioural impatience Mehu is only logically so nowhere near baby Dawn in terms of explosiveness(all laugh..lot)..\"\nMax(laughing..) : \"first time i said hallow Dawn,hallow MR Maximilian(all burst..,Dawn un..),so i knew this sort of a pest is going a long long way down darkness(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well this is how i was always irated there cause none listened to how they came to my intellect(all burst..)..first of all i never had any associations with master brats or Doctor Slate and so on cause neither mom nor dad liked them(all laugh..lot)..still now sometimes bro irritates them saying saw how her brat stopped her brats JUST to have an animation at home(all burst..)..so this is how everyone pester me always(all laugh..lot)..but now we all have found the counter to the Convene Skats the elder is never to be told Cerulean conference headship always collaborator any other word is viciously attacked in the particular case of Cerulean(all laugh..lot)..then the younger one is to be told like yeah in the reports(all laugh..lot),then there's a 1 hour long monologue on how to use words at Cerulean(all burst..)..and our HQ is here only barring Relations Doctors so people sometimes ask why they object to the city's name only when it's associated with their flowers(all laugh..lot)..we say well it's cause they both have to write reports by themselves which is viciously vetoed against as you know the rule introduced by Percy Kalos,Ivana dear yeah even her niece says this says no she's such a sweet little kid(all burst..)..then Windy sorry ma'am again all says they say she's ubiquitous to details(all un..) then finally the Mrs Cynatia(all un..long)..no they say she's untenable to squabble with ownself never satisfaction(all laugh..lot)..so they unanimously voted for it later Stu McShin changed a few rules along with Jasu like how the pokemons are to be mentioned without their problems but opinions(all un..long)..then the whole Ransei Elite4 are blindly infatuated with the Convene Skats since the end of time thus they're anyway not considered(all laugh..lot)..so,finally Marc The Mr Litman is there as their final say who says like no compeers when a report is written always mention if it was needed by the writer or expected by the evaluator you know once my Slurpuff didn't want to investigate the chasm between intention and want hence failed to win 3 advantaged rounds you know(all un..long,Iris..Marc The Mr Litman..no matters enquired,all un..long)..so these are the sort of brats that run the show now hence technical education has seen so much growth(all laugh..lot)..anyway you're not supposed to write the report as a gym leader or any yead yourself unless you're single or your spouse brat understand this term(all un..long) is in same profession then in physical cognition at full you should never write reports alone atmost if they can write mind another term fluently(all un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..but this isn't allowed for Cerulean alone cause all the flowers are ethereal in expression if they're not around their hubby brats or master brats or Lexical Sacks(all un..long)..so they do write  or each other(all laugh..lot) then i go to Professor Kukui for a starter and got Empol the the rockets intruded once more as ever thankfully for them the last time in their careers(all laugh..lot)..they i heard said we were told not to mingle with those brats after Hoenn cause they always suspected that Mehadi flower will vehemently object to end her her travelling days before atleast 23 years(all laugh..lot)..as Poppy flower was asked to manage the gym after her marriage which she did next time viciously namecalled DaisyDevil for not asking which wasn't received well(all un..long,..WaterFire,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) once that wasn't the case they tried it but Sinnoh was their stubbornness just anyway they came and all then Master Brat with Dashing Crook came first they did what they do then i ofcourse knew them all do master brats don't have any address actually it's impossible for them like how can it be comprehensive that one can find master brats to start with(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i didn't know about their works and all at all infact i just knew they were this strange thought provoking creatures(all laugh..lot)..anyway so i first of all saw the Dashing Crook(all laugh..lot) and instantly realized why even here all are around him like bunch of indolent fans(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i was going away from the convention that always takes place with Dashing Rock on this occasion(all laugh..lot) so i was going away on the gate they looked at me like was i out of this world(all laugh..lot),anyway i became the target of the rockets as i stepped out and so on existence played a game of chance with me you know(all laugh..lot)..anyway then crook asks of my health and all normal stuff takes half a minute(all laugh..lot) and they never ask for any specifications in such scenarios ever(all laugh..lot),so i have no idea why this idea came to my mind again a self to self tickling game i later found out(all laugh..lot) i said um..Mr Slate would you travel with me Professor can't travel with me and i wanted to travel alone but i don't understand these maps and all(all laugh..lot),well you can hook up with anyone,um..yeah but um..i just feel that it's exactly not nice cause i would start of as just a customer rather than a friend or something hence also i offered you to join me first than asking to accept me in your group(all un..,The Ethics of Moral Honesty,all un..),and the reply to those so exhorted views is(laughing)..Daftorabofajlitujerif(all un..long time)!..first of all Iris what does it mean(all un..)\"\nIris(laughing..) : \"no Ferdi don't move your head or eyebrows or anything barring widening your mouth when you shake hands else it's impossible to know whether you're acknowledging the actor's action or your own reaction..once my Omanyte couldn't draw a round due to this i remember(all un..long time,..Marc The Mr Litman,all un..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well i cursed myself so many tines for not being mindful of geography instruments(all laugh..lot)..anyway then at this i thought this must be a set up or something that name must be a code for something sinister that's gonna happen to me(all burst..) so i said,um..sorry but i didn't get if you agreed or just put me in your thoughts on what you were thinking before like suddenly from my conversations you've understood something sorry to say this but um..i don't know that word(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),the reply is,Vinjofidepaknasarapar(all un..)..this particular one Sirich would know(all laugh..lot)\nSirichai(laughing..) : \"um..yeah Genkie it was a great match against Ms Daphne,yeah but before coming out of the final fate did you first look at your badge then the gym the meaning is did you think about your badge's presence while looking at the gym or it's essence(all un..),um..i don't remember but when i was looking at the gym i felt like going back there right then not later and have the same match again it was so amusing,well you can have the same match with Karen,um..yeah but it's not the match but those moments how i approached it,you can simulate that too what made you aware of your presence not essence Sirich,um..well i guess i liked Daphne much(all laugh..lot),no no that's ok i like so many people you see i don't remember it anymore if i do or don't only the meaning of my refusal i can see as it means else nothing in being that is not self(all un..),um..no it didn't felt like ok how i did this and that the luck the decisions and all but um..it felt like that particular match was like i want to do everything again exactly the same no matter if i remember this or not like i don't really bother about anything like the outcome or else but i just liked this whole expression of this holistic witnessing of this very being included me the witness such i felt not just in terms of oh this experience you know it's like..,the presence of a stabilizing factor rather than enabling(all un..),um..yeah in terms of solution for being you can say(all un..),Vinjofidepaknasarapar!(all un..),um.. no she..,Kablatapajajnodiletom(all un..)..so i was very angry with these insinuations but as soon as this word insinuation came to my mind i thought of their types and instantly thought what the namecall am i thinking like saying Butterfree can't be an insinuation rather meaning if witnessing not in qualia can it(all un..long time),so now instantly I understood what i was saying so became a bit shy may be so said um..,Hiblocinemankubatofoz(all un..),i angrily said ok i like her um..(all un..,Dawn..Meaning Hands-On,all un..)..man it was just so true like i couldn't get rid of these absolute menaces whenever now i thought about Daphie so i was very angry and one day told Genkie enough of your diverting what do you want hum i just had a crush on her what's the big deal about it,Pikfenama..,hey hey,stop it ok(all un..long time,Genkai.. Pikfenamaralpumijehod,all un..long time)..so you see i was entangled in this horrible mess of dulality(all laugh..lot),so i was so irritated with them i couldn't forget Daphie at all which suddenly one day i understood as just to be-COUNTERING(all un..),so i told Genkie this is may be after a 2 weeks no more as at Frontier each day had 36 hours ATLEAST(all laugh..lot)..if you master asks if you're happy with something or not never mention the upper limit of happiness by only replying as yes no or could be..to be the most ENJOYING rhymes with waiting doesn't it Mr Salusar rhyming with if you are(all un..long time,..The Art of Starvation,all un..),so(all burst..) i thought i really wasn't anywhere when i heard these sort of discussion packages midmatch(all laugh..lot),anyway so i realized that Daphie was specially designed to be me(all laugh..lot),so i told Genkie ok fine i admit i'm infatuated with your dear little sis for longer than expected ok  what can i do about it i don't call her these days no more ok only called her twice last week(all laugh..lot),did she start with yeah rather than hallow or did she seem the most understanding when she said hallow(all un..),what sort of a question is this how can i say what she feels i can only say what i do,tell me the difference between this she and the she of Daphne(all un..),shut up ok why do you always talk about these days and why always change my opponents names in discussion if of your gender and don't allow me to interact with wild brats(all un..long time),you can't be without conservation of self Sirich against comprehension you're not really present at  invention of meaning rather interrogating what it means Sirich a description(all burst..),fare enough what does she say hum(all burst..),my time now goes to thee can you oppose(all un..)/this feeling of to be or pose(all un..)/my being now says that logic look plays(all un..)/in me thus self how can you repose(all un..)..says Hoopa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo pa pa pa Hoo(all un..),what's the difference then between this and infatuation then,why are you so worried about it Sirich it's just the meaning..any questions(all un..long time),so i said thus for 30 years you're picking each word out of lexicon to find their meaning against your relationship with you wife(all un..long time),the effective quiet(all un..long time,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja&Stash..Seldom Seldom Slalom/as Column ethical if not logical becomes situational jargon,all un..,..The Feathered Ones,all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i understood where it's gonna end up either you remember your spouse only during excretion else next flight Phantom(all un..long time),so after 2 more weeks total no more than 5 i said yeah i remember her all times if i want to in an abstract way,what's her(all burst..),ok she's all in me and ok i'll say these to her,Kimpuchiledabnupakulum(all un..long time)!,that why i can't be myself alone then if she's really all me fine i answer you she's only my superimposition on my self hence now appearing as my soul of differential being cause i want it's being as my not me take that you lowlife(all burst..),me only sends you to plurality Sirich what's the big deal(all burst..),ok ok anything so dear/reflection in me/i can't be separate/you're no more just thee(all laugh..lot,..Too Sweetie),atleast i didn't ask them to rather let her confirm my gender for a change(all un..long time),man what sort of a family i found myself u\nto belong to(all laugh..lot),so now anyway then me and Daphie spoke and all later she says i only said you were very nice that match couldn't have been anything else no matter how many times it replays,he's having a bit of air problem these days rhymes saw(all un..),so(all laugh..lot),Daphie being familiar with these sort of horrendous methods of thickening things said i went deep with washrooms (all un..)..man no wonder next time we saw each other physically was straight in the same registration centre end of journey where The Clinical Ones and The Feathered Ones all got their registration done 10 years prior the register was an elderly lady herself asked with so much glee on learning our story that the washroom is on the right any validation required(all un..),actually Daphie knew her she said she was there 10 years back as well then just about lost her twin sister to a disaster so was very dejected but had come to the office out of her 2/3 days vacation as she said it was done in Platue itself was a huge conference the event with the sort of witnesses that were their with their horrible ideas(all laugh..lot),so she said then they asked the office staffs if anyone has lost any direct family members to unnatural reasons this lady Mrs Stephanie i remember she said i said yeah then said they told me how my job opens up possibilities for me into the superimposition and identity actuations while i can pray for all and if there's a glitch i find then again pray and all and in return i can they said this word i can become a bit of a shrew so that to existence i can say rather than arising or setting what if i drew(all un..,Gus..hum,Civility!Education!Culture!,all un..,May un..long time)..man Drewy is something special you know being Cultured(all burst..,May un..)..so yeah this was one of my experiences i always tell everyone that i spent atleast 5 years in that one(all laugh..lot)..and yeah those names always comes up since Juritared atleast 2 each year and the preceding 13,5 more of them did(all laugh..lot) and each of those have paid their visits and those new imports stopped coming only 3 years back after 45 year vigil revealing 100 exact new brats(all laugh..lot),thankfully no bigger psychic than Ghostradarkarrigussonor has been found and that menace rejected these brats outright having no reason to be different at all(all laugh..lot)..ao ywah next time be prepared for that one 1000 years i realized in that 1 really isn't much in psychiatry(all laugh..lot) if distribute(all burst..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well for me those 2.5 years were 25 itself the whole traditionally accepted range of my physical youth(all burst..)..anyway then i said i didn't get it the meaning of Daftorabofajlitujerif the name Vinjofidepaknasarapar comes up,so now i thought they were challenging me(all un..),so i said um..excuse me but i don't believe i would've understood it before atleast 2/3 journeys if these words are related to pokemons(all burst..),says no Ms Berlitz cheer up you're going to have a great career ahead of you but just to be COUNTERING(all un..)..if only you can describe yourself physically when you excrete and mentally when you eat..shh..the most ENTAILING(all un..long time),i was sent to 7th hell absolute with their choice of words not the insinuation so said what do you mean i always clear my toilet myself and don't put my eyes off from my food if alone and don't move my head up and down that's enough that i can do if not all you too would admit i guess(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),money fame power gender wisdom compassion dissolution resolution which one do you want in exchange for addiction(all burst..),resolution ofcourse,it's rhetorical as i said countering(all un..long time),so i was so angry said i heard about your antics but not of your character(all un..,..DaisyDevil),yeah that feeling(all un..long time),now i shouted at both which they minutely listened to then asked did you shout because of your logic or your applicability(all un..),so now i was so irritated i said thanks but i've nothing to do with you two any more thanks(all laugh..lot),but that's a decision not resolution isn't it Ms Berlitz(all un..),what if i want gender(all un..),DANGER(all un..,Dangerous,all un..),i see what if money,money money money money..uncertainty lets be canny canny me..ME look..nuzzle nuzzle thee(all un..,..Guzzle Humdrum),what if power,the ethical tower(all un..long time,..

is that i don't like them nothing more(all un..long time),i see so you advocate for resolution,well it's as i said just a pun..just to be COUNTERING(all un..long time),so i somehow spontaneously said,um..ok i like this scheme you will be traveling with me(all un..),the meaning is that you can't think of be or to be(all burst..),i said um..no i don't know these things i want to be a trainer(all laugh..lot),what are the things that you know Dawnny(all laugh..lot),just that that you should call me either Ms Dawn or Ms Berlitz or the full with status else how can i understand whom are you referring to you,your conceptions,my conceptions me the whole like both or all of us the whole presence and it could be so many more so i only know my name is assured nothing else is barring the status cause it's um..like in my hand(all un..long time,Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),STEELIX(all un..),are you inclined to(laughing..) physical sports(all un..long time),man Kumlie said the fight instantly stopped at this-expectations of physical or analytical results(all un..),said judges complained against both of us we brushed them aside saying this is 4th round so we gave all concerned all sorts of entertainment and it's a DQ show us the money and namecall off from here(all burst..)..it was an absolute mayhem after three amusing rounds same for the normal fighting schedule so they got that at IRSGC you know later all admitted to this and realized that the master brats have designed this horrendous scheme of sharing and preemptive measures in physically dangerous and mentally indolent situations(all laugh..lot)..Kumlie said both of were knackered as hell after 3 rounds cause none of us listened to our corners as we didn't like each other(all laugh..lot) the  in 4th we're so tired i tell the brat namecall this and started those games he being from Pettlesberg of all places only did the same(all laugh..lot)..anyhow i said now i'm inclined to mental sports i like a few board games and all i just do the stretching exercises and normal walks and all nothing more(all laugh..lot),which is your favourite stretching,um..just the sitting hooked cross leg and breathing in the end of a like 20 minutes i do that for 10(all laugh..lot),good get in that position,um..ok(all burst..),so ofcourse i kept my open which now they put a towel in front of me(all burst..),so i didn't say anything cause by then i understood they belonged to some very crude gang(all burst..),anyway no with this whole situation of non-physical sports(all laugh..lot)..now Dashing Rock and

nuzzle me(all un..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"so this continues for how long i don't know but i didn't want to open my eyes now it felt so absurd to have one just to see what's my,countering(all burst..)..anyway eventually after sometimes i couldn't stay sited no more so lied down but that stuff continued and i also kept my eyes closed and felt like yeah this whole ambience is really SO ENSUING(all burst..)..anyway then Guzzle Humdrum was only humming after that as you know it's so trifle the language to counter(all laugh..lot) anyway then eventually my got hold of me so i was relieved(all burst..) so i said,um..yeah how will our journey be then bro(all laugh..lot),the first answer is joint,oh feeling feeling don't you suspect me/as on you my dealing..now respect me(all un..long time),so i was like so spontaneously angry which how was possible I don't know still(all laugh..lot) and said in the similar way excuse the language cause that too was like spontaneousness of spontaneity,you b.. you can't go beyond reflection with counters ADMIT THIS(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..) and the reply is(all burst..),morning in only my eyes(all un..),look morning is thus sight's disguise(all un..),so i was so irritated with them again it was spontaneous said atleast it's not to counter but elaborate in conjunction rather than the conjunction the darkness itself ADMIT this you metaphorical b..(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),so now they said in unison,Dawnny please first THINK(all un..),so i was even more angry and said similarly i don't have to you b.. i know you forever you hide behind names to jump what i can't do like i said hence always intrude me in the name of i veiling ego(all un..,Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),now master brat became extremely serious instantly crook not so much but undertood the Feeling hence later told me(laughing..) felt not trying to feel more(all un..long time)..so(all laugh..lot),now master brat says indeed Ms Berlitz but who excretes and who eats that(all laugh..lot),um..but i don't know hence i want to travel with you(all burst..),well you don't need to you see cause you can do it yourself as you corroborated to me thanks(all laugh..lot)..now both goes out so i was desperate and said no i'll go with you too(all laugh..lot),well then you should meet us tomorrow evening after going through your processes and consulting with this person no more than twice and no less than never(all burst..) on your progress in-between Ms Sabrina Marnold,Saffron Gym Leader rest assured(all laugh..lot),so i according to timezones understood i can only contact once cause it was already 1 in the night you know otherwise master brats never talk serious matters(all burst..)..so anyway i researched about them and sank in this huge 30 year volume plus 3 preceding the manual Hands-On(all laugh..lot) and i didn't even know what was a Pokemon Lab i just wanted to be a trainer cause both my parents are(all burst..)..i just learnt how to handle pokemons and didn't know anything about psychics except theories never could manage them so i was just supposed to be this most ordinary trainer though i believed i could get atleast one contest with normal Pokemons cause it was possible all are pokemons why not(all laugh..lot)..hence Empol i managed well in a day itself anyway but i knew i only could handle grass,steel,ice and water types..electric,fire,fight,bug and posion i didn't understand one bit(all laugh..lot)..i had some knowledge of grounds but i never knew why rock is in the same group like i got flying types and normal types a bit but again their grouping as a couple meant there's more truth to fiction of ease(all laugh..lot)..steel type i got well ground the next so i thought ok rocks can't do much can they(all laugh..lot,.. Leading Rock,all laugh..lot)..yeah if only i knew(all laugh..lot)..then next was fly last was normal so i thought ok i can't go beyond atleast ground/normal mix(all laugh..lot)..water/ice was second best steel third and grass types i knew pretty well hence thought ok i can manage darks and fairys psychics i can't i know it too but ghosts i heard is just playful so i thought ok they won't be mine so why would they want me to be them(all laugh..lot)..then i didn't know any valley except where grass pokemons were found and for water/ice i just wanted to visit the southern commons for long with like 10 grass types(all laugh..lot)..steel I thought well if i can get good but i'm not going to search many places and which will those places be at all i'll learn where to find them on the go(all laugh..lot)..then i didn't know about authority,champions,general training,special training even(all laugh..lot),research,medicine_test nothing i didn't even know how to be a gym leader no i didn't know i had no interest in these things(all laugh..lot) i only learnt the contest rules and the breeders and doctors(all laugh..lot)..no i really didn't know i tell you(all laugh..lot,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all laugh..lot)..and the month after this day i had a Cobalion which Mango later explained was caught by purely abstract sensitivization of () planes(all laugh..lot)..anyway(all laugh..lot) so then i thought with the brats who grasped me doesn't care a fig for any specifications surely so i just decided to do what i knew 24/7 since someone snatched away my lollypop as a kid at second sem school then when i grabbed her,her twin bro came over and alone overpowered me by pulling my hair(all burst..) to this his sis laughed so much saying see boys have more power than us..nana(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i was so happy dad wasn't there among us for guidelines(all burst..,Bazugh,David,Sirichai,Iris,Marlon and Bonnie,May,Melody un..) anyway that was the only thing i knew the biasing and unbiasing and it's neutrality i knew everything about it later read so much about rights and all the only things that the master brats didn't consider at all cause they're only derivatives of ADMINISTRATION and POLICING..the most Encouraging(all un..),anyhow(all laugh..lot)..so of course those had been deepened far more just to be countering obviously(all laugh..lot)..that's all i knew and read the social this and that hence only failed the sociology papers cause i knew too much for society(all burst..)..and that was such a wrong choice you know i found out Hands-On(all laugh..lot,..Civilization,all laugh..lot)..anyway so i returned to now what the master brats did with general public at certain issues then saw that there's no end to it cause that is all about them(all laugh..lot)..now it already was 3 in the night(all laugh..lot)..so i slept for 3 hours woke up at 6 meaning it's now about 13 at Saffron so tried to contact Sabrina first up with the intention to talk about pure grass type training(all laugh..lot)..so i call her,um..hallow Ms Marnold i'm Dawn Berlitz..,ah Dawnny you bros told me about you today morning here(all laugh..lot),um..thanks Ms Marnold um..,no it's ok dear i also don't have much time today itself there had to be so much pressure they told me they think you're best suited for medicine test actually(all laugh..lot) to check that infact you can read this article i once had to give this talk from dark type point of views and they recorded it here this is the name best wishes dear i'll be free later call me then(all laugh..lot),so i thought this is a trap to defame me(all laugh..lot)..anyway the day before i didn't look up Sabrina now i do and again there's so much work about Haunter(all laugh..lot)..but i just got how these brats spoil so many truly great people(all laugh..lot) anyway then i went to that talk didn't understand even the words why they were in a sentence I didn't know anything(all laugh..lot)..anyway so then it's breakfast time and i went in now instantly recalled about its emphasis so was attentive to it then i just tried to do that staying attentive after food but couldn't so i thought ok i'll do some kind of mentation which i did all the time till it was evening Sabrina wasn't available whole world was channelized into Saffron ofcourse i too undertood how(all laugh..lot)..so i didn't like it how they were deceiving me hence i just went back doing those mentations thinking about that song rather the meaning ofcourse(all laugh..lot) and yeah Empol was snatched away from me the day before(all laugh..lot) so i did those mentations and all till it was evening when i go to meet them and i see Simile Popcorn doing the rhythm i instantly thought of that very song with both her feets and finger on ger nose with breathing exercises and the feet movements was of a strange pattern later learnt how regular jumping rope can become so horrendous a methodology of THE MEANING(all laugh..lot)..so i said,um..hallow Ms Ketchum i'm Dawn Berlitz i was told to come here at this time to meet Mr Stash and Doctor Brock so i guess you're here for that(all laugh..lot),no i'm not sorry(all laugh..lot),um..ok but um..can you tell me..,no no i don't know about them they left before i came and Stashey never keeps a number Brock is unreachable i too tried sorry to disappoint you Ms Berlitz(all laugh..lot),um..but um..do you know anything about me(all laugh..lot),no more than what you said just previously no more(all laugh..lot),um..ok sorry to disturb you Ms Ketchum,take car..,Himjabifemultepik(all un..),i really thought i wasn't but was this creatur.. what is wrong with me(all un..,Serena..Reticence Vat,all un..long time),so i really didn't understand anything but none of the other people did either(all laugh..lot),then she says in front of all this is Ms Dawn Berlitz,Pokemon Master,Gallery of Fame,8,8,8,8,no situational discritization,the most emotionally continuing\nthanks(all un..)..zapped me off with her to where how could i have known as i didn't even understand how zapping worked(all laugh..lot)..now i was zapped to this room where instantly someone blindfolded and gagged me next thing i knew i was in this dark cave with a fire at the outlet with an extremely strange looking creature sitting beside it poking the fire with an iron stick singing(all laugh..lot)..\ngo to sleep..go to sleep go to sleep my name\nas AND : the Hologram of Is(all un..) poke dreamy eyes and the little thing hollers MEH(all un..long time,..Daily Hologram,all un..)..\ni now was so angry and frustrated and scared and all i shouted you b.. what do you want huh,what's a b..,shut up you b.. I've had enough of this,what is p..(all burst..),shut up ok they are anger and frustration i'm only annoyed..um..(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),HYDREIGON(all un..)..and four of those menaces appear beside me(all laugh..lot),i said hey i know who you are but why are you playing these games with me,next moment i'm unconscious next moment first time i had so much pain in my head as i hear with a prototype translator the most raw version rest are deemed(laughing..) empty of interest(all un..long time),so(all laugh..lot) then i had this sensation and i it's as if someone saying in my mind a thought comes from outside not of my own like,gaming not male is the fiction of your desire to be unprepared isn't it rhyming with how so it(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i didn't know anything but i was so scared so i said despite all the psychic pain cause it too was spontaneous infact i didn't know till then what's spontaneous fear and spontaneous memory(all un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot) then somehow i said that,but fiction requires a commitment to exploration by gaming i'm only trying to redirect my trepidation towards affirmation so how is your choice of desire valid with unpreparedness rather should be my intention to unpreparedness so that i can insure my attempt not aim(all un..,Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),then they said,rhyming with solvable not experiential claim isn't it(all un..),no i couldn't remember what i said but i was there that i remember with Daily Hologram getting rid of my translator intervening in the process this process i had to learn sadly too this only Daisy,Mehadi,Poppy,Brock and Lillie know except the direct brats of the dark clan only the trainers know that is Gladie,Gus,Gungie,Gary and ofcourse The Feathered Ones,Dr Jackal understands the process unlike each of them but can't execute unlike each of them dual equanimity the observing detachment(all un..long time)..and Doctor Slate can't execute it only make the concerned two help to FEEL it(all un..,Gladys,Guang,Gus,Genkai and Blossom..Dialga don't be a gambler just looking as yourself is,all un..,..Thus understand that you the feeling..is only what here AMISS,all un..,..That Feeling,all un..)..anyhow(all burst..),this brat learnt it all by himself obviously (all laugh..lot,.. Leading Rock,all laugh..more),and he passed it onto DaisyDevil whose style demands each skill but no tricks in the book the characteristics that is not actually those as they're granted to being(all burst..,..DaisyDevil),then Lillie flower stumbled upon it herself ofcourse then was restrained from not mingle with these in an underwater volcano all alone thus certainly in that geography never lone(all laugh..lot) and no except Gungie,Gus,Gladie and The Feathered Ones none of us can apply it on anyone(all laugh..lot) but yeah master brats never required to know or do as you know(all burst..)..and the flowers are too sweet as you know they can't do these at all unless their own hubbies(all laugh..lot)..and no Viol flower doesn't know it cause it's psychic knowledge completely abstract and absolutely tacit has to be handed down(all laugh..lot)...Dr Oak knows it but you know never needs it cause if you're anyone and Dr Oak turns up then it's always so special especially if say you're his newborn sis and baby bro and and your beau lives the next home(all laugh..lot)..\"\nGladys,Genkai and Blossom(laughing..) : \"excuse me Gary i..hush Professionalism!(all un..) did your self suffered a stroke(all un..)/so that now you're not patient enough to learn the consent hence discombobulate logical progress(all un..) hence just Dr Oak(all un..,Clemont,Bazugh,Marlon and Bonnie..An Iss..Hush! generalization!,all un..,a being must have,to clarify own self,a professional tissue..anything else on it's generalization,all un..long time,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"so(all laugh..lot) such a brat is agnostic of skills(all burst..)..and no a few others may know but none in the known ranks know it and i'm sure they can't apply it if say a Ghostradarkarrigussonor calm max full wild(all burst..) turns upon Professor or grandma or Cippie(all laugh..lot)..that only these 5 menaces can do but again master brats never needed it or the fact that it's tacit you know they are completely knowledge proof(all un..)..man what sort of creatures these are(all laugh..lot) and yeah obviously you don't need to know or do anything if you know what's Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..but the only difference to all including Gungie and rest is that they learnt everything only after Saffron and then they spent all their lives till then surrounded by pokemons and i only knew about non psychic grass types(all laugh..lot) and was forced into one of the most elusive facets of their skillset before i could register(all burst..)..with 4 most evolved record setter Hydreigons trained by a being never person named Daily Hologram with a most raw prototype translator that was rejected the first later(all laugh..lot)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..no wonder i couldn't find any word called solace(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Daily Hologram sticks with me for my safety as i was communicating with Hoodie,Huddie,Hydro,Hydru(all laugh..lot)..i when  woke up saw how Raki treats his brats as if all of them including him are 3 year olds(all laugh..lot)..but anyway when i woke up i first saw Raki and i was gagged and deafened i couldn't talk or hear anything(all laugh..lot),then just saw what he was doing with his brats for sometimes then he left and Lixue came in untangled me and gave me some food that was so delicious which i learnt later one from the collection of Pewter Dish(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Lixue first forcefully fed me holding me up herself they never required any assistance in that as never knew what it means in application only what it means in rendition(all un..,..Simile Popcorn,all un..), anyway so i tasted it was great food and she fed me throughout then washed my hands i only had to wash my mouth(all burst..) and only then i was allowed to talk and this is my first record as my communicator was returned to me(all laugh..lot)..so i put it out as record she didn't have any recorders..\"\n\n after much fuss win and all so yeah out of all this very start was THE most memorable(all laugh..lot)..some people asked me which journey was better first or last..first ofcourse is first ever in Frontier system(all laugh..lot) but they said no in the last you were so assured(all laugh..lot) i said well i by then had enough not to be so and had to foster my sonny as well(all laugh..lot) but i old Gustie too day 1 that it wasn't first journey it was a textbook to all who wants to get prepared to see The Elusiveüêâ(all laugh..lot)..and then what to do there is actually all the same like Kanto same setup same everything but the Gyaradoses had the incentives Irissalad didn't have any damn thing to do with them except the same number of journeys and the assurance of the Elite4 shot hence volunteered to jump into Unova with thankfully a Haxorus atleast(all burst..)..oh yeah i also was told that they always patronized why neither Poppy nor Mehadi were chosen in you place hum(all un..),i said you need assistance way more than I'll ever require cause you believe you cam answer someone asking you to confirm his or her gender while giving the rigour behind you reasoning(all un..,..The Darkened Ones,all un..,Gus un..)..or can answer if it were you the questioner was talking to not your sense faculties reflecting the fact that you were sure you were talking with someone particular rather than logical(all un..,..The Clinical Ones,all un..,Guang un..)..and Dave knows very well what was going on at Veilstone so perfect name as well for exactly that(all laugh..lot)..man i heard the Great Boss said that that journey was the SOLE reason why we involved the lower foot tactics cause if the best of profession can't hack a teenager what would you do when Kimmie the Kommo-O comes to have metaphysical tea with you(all burst..)..and in the end i wasn't abducted to Unova to sort myself out only as you know they themselves did that but from Unova the younger and most hideously from under the cover the elder hence that mess was created..and yeah my routine was like that today i'll be at the southern commons tommow at Surelectric Valley whereas yesterday i was at Linoluni Ranges(all laugh..lot)..then the same month 2 cups 2 gyms next month 2 gyms and 2 contests again after having a bash at Lyfostrafos ofcourse the day before a contest or so(all laugh..lot)..and yeah each were class of eminences or run by book of distinctions(all laugh..lot)..then at Johto some said man it doesn't get any better than that can it like it's so EXCITING(all burst..) then said why would you think about personal life man what's in it so ENTICING(all un..)..i said if only what you said comes in psychic and emotional channels from plane agnostic menaces that isn't going to be found before atleast a millenia you'll know indeed it was so ensuing(all laugh..lot)..and i always say these cause it was like i started at 17 and 7 after completing one of my sociology papers the month before mind the subject(all burst..) and it was cause i failed in the written but passed the demonstrative meaning i didn't cheat atleast unlike a few(all laugh..lot,May.. Civility Hands-On,all burst..,Gladys,Genkai and Blossom,Guang,Gus..Stash un..),so(all laugh..lot) then at 17 and 7 i started and ended at 20 and 3 with the ultimate possiblities of my present profession having been all done and dusted there's nothing left to do good night have a nice life and i was 20 and 5 rhymes saw(all burst..)..but yeah May it would've been a piece of cake for someone like your beau why would he reject this opportunity just for sake of education(all burst..)\"\nMay(laughing..lot) : \"why cause i come from a CULTURED family ok(un..,all un..)..man my üåπ was tormented like nothing but still said thank God each time i had enough civility to make sure they leave me alone to travel around DESTINY(un..,all un..)..and no Pasio was a special journey for both of us but it was nothing like Sinnoh man that was massacre of general training profession(all laugh..lot)..all knew Unova was coming and it did come but then Crawdauntogator was another level that none realized how was possible like that Kalos Final with the subsequent bro vs beau hallucinations that's not happening again no way not in temporal scales only existential definitely(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well once i went to a psychiatrist she said Ms Berlitz cheer up life is always about in self feeling not being a possibility fuelled decision(all burst..),i said yeah thanks that feeling(all un..)..man it's just impossible to reject the that dark clan once you've been part of it(all laugh..lot)..then once at a pub some asked hey Dunnie how's the drinks after party heard they are the MOST expensive(all un..),so i was embroiled in a melee as an answer(all laugh..lot) which was true but psychic channel and personal life are never going to conjoin always transposed(all laugh..lot)..and well still first final was Mr Georges next one and only Melody(all laugh..lot)..and these brats were so happy at Sinnoh cause they could babysit her and irritate me all they wanted all the time while dictating poor Johnny Lad's psychological states then via proxy only(Melody bursts..,all laugh..lot)\"\nMelody(laughing..) : \"well that journey was something else for me after around 6 years of upheavals(all laugh..lot) and yeah these brats were too happy most of the times i travelled with the The Feathered Ones(all laugh..lot) along with Yummie and  Simile Popcorn and Daily Hologram as our preceptors who as a pair was a horrendous torture on duality(all laugh..lot),anyway(all laugh..lot),then next group started with Lillie flower(all laugh..lot) who was with Gladly Syndrome(all laugh..lot) and ofcourse the tuple of Lastly Phantom and Shadowy Lantern the most engulfing team for duality atleast their elder ones weren't physically violent(all laugh..lot) they always brought two hand combat pads along when they argued were doing the physical exercise as well which Niji always hit and Ash ducked(all burst..) their elder ones were happy with only the completely wrong only not to them the full match shadows(all un..) and all of these menaces were the entourage of Incentive Overdose(all laugh..lot) who always brought her own personal security thus that was bro(all burst..)..and our group most times were divided into me,Genkie and Lixue and Blossie,Yummie and Raki whereas Vigil was kicked away to Sinnoh after the very second journey at Pasio and didn't meet Yummie till she ended her journey he always complained to us how inhuman this setting was that he had to peek from Hoenn this time(all laugh..lot) then when Lillie flower was there she went always with Gladly Syndrome hence both were always at risk(all laugh..lot) so Weather Chat managed Lillie flower and Lastly Phantom was controlling Gladie's effusiveness the only ones except Margin and Blithie who could(all laugh..lot)..with Jubilee Hands-On you don't become anything only Hands-On(all burst..) anyway then after this finally bro was left to manage Incentive Overdose(all laugh..lot) while always poking both her and her beau's relationships always that was shown separate hence both were mad and returned the difference of the join(all un..) anyhow(all laugh..lot) so then the final set was baby Dawn who was at the care of Dashing Crook(all laugh..lot) and was finally left to consult with anytime anyplace -Master Brat anything else(all burst..),apart from how to understand life not just understand life(all un..) as it was taught by Loaf and Toast(all burst..) man it's so true what Dawnny just said it was a textbook to the practice of meeting The Elusive üêâ certainly she got hands-on dragonic teachers literally along with Ms Volbeat's translation courses on emotional existence and obscurity(all laugh..lot)..but yeah the Kanto Beginning with the disciples with their flowers hosted by the twin paring of the opposing versions of the master brats along with master brat managing Gladly Syndrome and The Feathered Ones doing the rounds in-between never together(all laugh..lot) with finally the Leading Rock being the head of this whole band that entourage of sanity(all burst..) certainly was out of this world absolutely(all laugh..lot)..still it's like daily novels so May travelled with a strange set of brats actually(all laugh..lot)\"\nMay(laughing..) : \"well unlike each atleast i was well educated before going out if not made cultured over that as a bonus(all un..)..and ofcourse when you're with Dr Jackal or Mr Vreen or Dashing Crook you don't think about civility even Melody literally hit Brock so many times who was 41 and Melody was 32(all burst..,Melody un..,..Dashing Dashing Rock)..but well i travelled with Cladly and Scarlie throughout that was something(all laugh..lot)..no i literally travelled with all that was at Hoenn then with as usual Doctor Slate as personal sweeper (all laugh..lot)..of those FEELINGS (all un..,..THAT FEELING..shh..so NA√èVE,all un..)..man no wonder only someone as outrageous as Ms Volbeat could better the Dashing Rock(all laugh..lot)..but just a thing Gladie how was the travel of DaisyDevil(all laugh..lot)\"\nGladys(laughing..) : \"look observing your self is a management bully with recurrent characterizations in hand(all un..)/look now is forwarding the dissent of having induction rather than perception in your character's hand(all un..,..DaisyDevil)..well still it wasn't like our Ransei holidays atleast(all laugh..lot)\"\nBlossom(laughing..) : \"excuse us but we're searching for Mr Vitor Vuhagob,we see welcome welcome it's gonna be pretty long(all laugh..lot),Sir 'mam it's ok we could..(all laugh..lot),why not sonny whole world know your..,but it could also be called contravention(all un..),who the namecall is this and why has he appeared of the blue(all burst..)..no no i was always here just before you mentioned me i just was a bit..um..as me contagious(all un..),oh yeah..,STOP! IT'S THAT JACKAL OF Detached Observation(all un..) read his words properly of being notionally contagious..\nlook in my eyes..what would i see(all un..)/the bush of observable eligibility(all un..)/from there i see your anger,and i see your dream(all un..)/just cause i'm the you in what you as i seem(all un..)/thus oh compeers..don't ask for my visibility(all un..)/as look i'm the jackal of believability(all un..)/as i'm the ü¶ä of rationality(all un..)/oh mental Police the jackal of authority(all un..)/Oh Cerulean..look has finally in rhymes come..from the bushes of ego-The ü¶ä of personality(all un..,..Dr Jackal,all un..)..man when jackal arrived after 16 years and a quarter it was just impossible to describe what happened to each concerned planes(all laugh..lot)..and that fight glimpse was something else as well Gus would tell you his Gyarados only understands what he does if with him the counter to non self black box exactly why that drama played so perfectly for the casual onlookers(all laugh..lot,..The Darkened Ones,all burst..,Gus un..)\"\nGus(laughing..) : \"well atleast we weren't mingling in prepositions never conjunctions(all un..)..anyway after the Rocketeers relieved us we were in a difficult physical situation so somehow made the shore then all of us fainted and well i only made it because Mehu was there no matter how weak cause any of the WaterFire's become invigorated in only those two elements the more raw the better always Gungie only got that at Dark Nights(all un..)..anyway then she herself fainted and i anyway fainted before so Arct and Pullie were there to watch over who only poked both of us in unconscious too we realized just was in nervous agony(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i wake up first as Mehu fainted only trying to get me to wake up so fainted right upon me which meant i was in more danger cause she anyway weighs 75 kgs(all laugh..lot)..but later she told me if it were The Feathered Ones Slalom Seldom would heal herself by the process of nonchalant haste itself something Mehu when told said but that i can only practice out of emotion(all burst..) was told a piece that came as 'Practice : the motion of virtuality'(all un..,..The Feathered Ones,all un..)..anyhow(all laugh..lot),then i wake up to actually my brats forcing me to wake up as that was told to them if they sensed anything and felt i was out for too long for Mehu's comfort never mine you know that's not in consciousness(all burst..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so anyway i wake up somehow to a person who unlike Mehu or Brock or Ash or anyone was interested more to see if i was detached from being physically unconscious now for some logic(all un..) so then i saw a very handsome man in his late 20s it seemed had a hairband on forehead with half shorts and a green shirt and shoes all green(all laugh..lot) and his look was exactly like he sees you and sketches you in himself as again the i in both observes(all burst..)..so then i said yeah thanks Sir,first words were,um..yeah,but your compeer is still unconscious we should get her back,i said how Dr Oak taught us to think in this physically dangerous situations as hmm..Pokemon Master..hmm..(all burst..)..observing THEN learning..hmm..(all un..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so i said yeah it's ok then he did the major work in helping Mehu up who also said thanks Sir thanks for saving us,no problem 'mam,Sir it's ok it's natural for anyone get yourselves comfortable,so we both now said,hmm..(all burst..),anyway then on the road to nearest centre says how he found us and all well none asked ever who we were since we were 4(all laugh..lot) anyway then ofcourse in reply to why my brats did do what he old them says oh i'm a researcher and pretty travel experienced too this is my 4th journey very last one was Unova itself(all laugh..lot) so i have the experiences first hand and all but suddenly a bell rings in my head as to how he looked at me then didn't return my thanks rather brushed it aside then when it was said for unison returned it saying 'mam BEFORE Sir so i said hang on what does he know of appropriation of spontaneity(all un..),so then after we reach the centre in like 2 minutes zapping(all laugh..lot) these were again just the consolidation phase so got 10/15 minutes so then i said well i have a few questions Nr Skechit that is cause you know from where i belong(all laugh..lot) so i just wanted to ask why you only replied to both our greeting in unison,then i see as if so much surprised says,no no you two were there together hence it was only ethical to reply to us than we you know these very well but you only said me cause it was spontaneous but then i thought ok in dulality it's discombobulating always the existence to look at hence had to wait till you recall the dual WE but then again it's spontaneity that physical verbosity or movement suddenly out of directional categorization from it's abstract form it might be hard for you to say WE before my get attached to my claim of being myself rather than the observer from it so then to help you also i pointed your attention to the WE in honesty without replying the thanks to be moral about my perception anyway thanks Mr Ketchum this opportunity to self rather than it's action(all un..,..Dr Jackal,all un..),so i hardly managed to control myself from not send him as a ping pong between Arct and Pullie(all burst..) so i laughed and said yeah thanks but Mehu was smiling still understanding things so just before she's sent for checking i said thanks I won't need it Mehu too understanding something stopped expressing her dissent at me turning it to our facilitator(all laugh..lot),i said it's ok you go it's ethics(all burst..),so she goes and she had to wasn't ok for me and Gungie that's not a problem cause we had to practice physical spontaneity whole day with master brats from 1.5 to 3.5 Hands-On too(all laugh..lot) which none else did physically certainly not if in conjunction cause The Feathered Ones first hand said not going to happen(all laugh..lot) and neither Margin himself testified  nor Dr Oak or Gladie or anyone else did that we were sure hence she goes i stay(all laugh..lot) now before she actually goes Dr Jackal observes the whole situation similarly and gets up saying you should go too Mr Ketchum i'll wait for you and your friend to come out of the your troubles we'll meet then(all laugh..lot),then after that he himself actually comes in and we were sitting together so now normally talks also about it(all laugh..lot) so i was so irritated with my deduction powers(all burst..)..then anyway the language of ours were prepared Professionally for me and Personally for her(all burst..)..so he laughs and all then goes away but then we were talking about the brats and all anyway he told us will see Goldy,Tiffin,Arct and Pullie the only ones we had with us so then next day he says yeah thanks for letting me examine them it's nice to meet you etc verbal garbage(all laugh..lot),so now i said well i want to ask the things you studied at your research course Mr Skechit we've done not always a justice to it(all laugh..lot),again so naturally says no no it's only going to be an injustice if it were made stagnant at being not self Mr Ketchum cause formulation is impossible from actuative implementation rather than potential applications thus possible here is only axioms(all un..),so now Mehu asks him Mr Skechit my last caught mate is a Pyukumuku and her distinct feature is that she likes to play\"\n\n\nso i was in absolute heaven to be able to meet Dr Jackal in psychophysical being(all laugh..lot) so now i contacted Lixue and asked her what you'd you see if you find the jackal as a researcher(all laugh..lot)..\"\nLixue(laughing) : \"look that's a ü¶ä of ensuing (all laugh..) thus is the Dr of self sufficiency that's   success's Jackal(all un..)..with a pen just to be moral to the memorial dual hand(all un..)/look hops around the professional bushes(all un..)..to catch the self in personal sand(all un..)/oh it's a jackal of representation (all un..)..thus sketching what IS the you(all un..)/look enshrines the detached self in witnessing feeling(all un..)..by formulating your self not receiving in own but giving you that as that's what's not you(all un..)/oh look in this class of being..just entered the jackal of things(all un..)/is only here to observe how to see(all un..)..hence becomes a management bully observing the character of your self the me not your your that's the being(all un..,..The Fitted Ones,all un..)/oh hush before Reticence pay the emotional VAT(all un..)..you're observation is only to get your ego to on you tackle(all un..)/thus to be ego engulfing meaning look forward to the starving of the idea of US(all un..)..asking the difference between consciousness and indication to activity's JACKAL(all un..)..\njust like the clouds..roaming around without direction but conservation/look goes the jackal of being(all un..)..the characterizations of analysis in not availability but precipitation(all un..)/oh look the ü¶ä of following(all un..)..buys the ticket to go to how(all un..)/thus look at the jackal of explorative stations(all un..).. waiting for only the ü¶ä of now(all un..long time,David..Simile of Chaos is experience's

    "body": "Dawn(laughing..) : \"so yeah i had 44 brats who caught me at the very start(all laugh..lot)..and Cobbie came the 3rd month barring the starting one(all laugh)..and he came along with Celesteela in a group first ever 2 catches(all burst..) from same valley(all burst..) next group was Terrakion and Aerodactyl from same valley again anything else(all laugh..lot)..and this was capped off by GARCHOMP(all un..)..whole of next day i was unconscious yet understood how Chumpie was mingling in my concepts of personal life(all un..) so woke up next day then the day after that was with her next day kicked out to get a Kaledo time now Phantom(all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) in my 2nd month from start i was with 5 pseudo-legends and my starter without a single gym,cup or contest entry 2 months into my VERY first journey(all laugh..lot)..and i was the greatest sacrificial lamb to this impossible and inhuman scheme never mentioned to me(all laugh..lot)..so next month i knew i'll do the cup against my desire to become a co-ordinator anyway i was thinking just one off next League absolutely Phantom(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) then i get into the cup and all break this news i was so angry and frustrated and afraid and felt cheated and all i dialled the Police straightaway on charge of abduction in front of a BoD cup all looked at me definitely as Phantom(all un..)..anyway first ever cup with 6 pseudo-legends and yeah a ground cup had to be with the Leading Rock organising my beheading(all laugh..lot)..so no wonder i failed so so miserably after Unovan bushes began(all laugh..lot)..man i still thank DESTINY so much that it saved my poor Zekrom from horrendous fellow menaces like Zeky Ketchum(all laugh..lot,Glayds,Genkai and Blossom,Gus and Guang and this is your CUMULATIVE contribution to their lives,all un..,Cilan too un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot),so after i enter my first contest with Cobalion,Terrakion,Aerodactyl,Celesteela,Garchomp and Empol ofcourse with Kaledo,Silvally and lastly Urshifu having just come 5 days before(all laugh..lot)..settled on 3nd last day next day i had time with her but the day after i was forced to  anesthesia and woke up at the facilitation for my first contest with the Leading Crook saying in front of everyone..\nwake up..wake up..oh my baby wake up)/emotion, excitement..oh let my baby intellect in self wake up(all un..,..Dashing Leading Rock,all un..),while moving a sandwich in front of my face(all un..)..this was the simulation of physical paralysis with ensuing physical danger from a public execution being tormented with food after starvation hence that song on self intellect(all un..,Genkai and Blossom,Guang,Gus..Dialga don't be a gambler just let you get this feeling soaked,all un..,as you understand you're soaking can you feel your self without being now going broke,all un..,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja&Stash..Oh The Dagger of life now face this Boulder look has come the Dashing Cloak,all un..,May..good morning Brock,have you felt that mental morning is not only in your being that the biological clock now having enough to let also your emotions to get soaked,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot),this was the very start then i woke up and was so angry and frustrated and all exactly when i realized this whole situation hence calmed down a bit preparing my logic of namecalling(all laugh..lot)..yeah that is spontaneous hence must be logical else next flight goodbye with a just caught Elusiveüêâ(all un..,David and Sirichai..Dark Nights with Brat Ketchums,all un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot),then i get in having known that i was this great sacrifice for the embodiment of The Elusiveüêâ(all laugh..)..no a few did complain exactly this hence some counsellors came after my Frontier win saying congrats Dawn but life is so enjoyable you know not always so destiny driven(all un..),i just told them to put a translator in none found them again at their personality or profession it's heard cause of the art of starvation(all un..) anyway then first of all there's this huge official furore on abuse and abduction cause none knew my whereabouts for 2 months barring Professor Kukui who ofcourse refused to divulge it(all laugh..lot)..and yeah this reminds me what happened at Birch labs when Max joined Oak Labs and i recall this cause this utter pest was the only one whom i could relate to the most there and still he's 6 long years older to me(all laugh..lot)..\"\nMax(laughing..) : \"well the Sinnoh entourage was certainly something unveiling Project Baby Dawn(all laugh..lot)..and we were kept in dark then Brock returns too happy says finally we found the embodiment of the whole WaterFire clan(all laugh..lot)..then ofcourse the 4th version was present with us(all laugh..lot),she certified the same but then wanted to fondle her too much that's Poppy flower ofcourse(all laugh..lot) which she was denied the rights of after mingling DaisyDevil into it when Dawnny was tricked to say how she was so proud to meet her hearing her fortitude against the personal life difficulties since her TRAVELING days(all burst..),this completely set her off on Colony Monogram who as usual only thickened it(all laugh..lot)..and Dawnny was made to listen to this to test if she could mingle Viol flower's emotional intelligence into the Characteristics of DaisyDevil(all laugh..lot)..which she did by advocating for what she wanted to do herself which she expected from us and all while disparaging our characters viciously but then was again tricked into insinuating about Discuss hence the original WaterFire viciously jumped her(all laugh..lot),no it was a literal melee we understood time could never separate these two(all laugh..lot) and the sort of language they were using and all thoroughly scanned Dawnny's particular existence and initiated the Project Baby Dawn(all laugh..lot)..which again the 4th version of the flower along with judgement by Lillie flower(all laugh..lot,..Lillie flower) there when asked of any objections vehemently criticised the Master Brats for denying full enshrinement of personal minuteness in the name of characters(all un..)..later during Unova and subsequent when Dawnny wasn't LIKING us(all laugh..lot) then ofcourse Master Brats will always go after you no matter where you are as you know Poppy says that even Mrs Chansbert said this is unethical practice out of institutionalization this is inhuman(all burst..) but anyhow these all actually proved that how Project Baby Dawn was actually always there it's just that existence always colludes with Master Brats against comprehension(all laugh..lot)..no man the things Dawnny had to go through was absolutely 2 whole careers fused in one in one journey the very first the only reason was that she couldn't do Unova right after her physique would've given up hence was debarred and then the rest is just what it is explicable never comprehensive just as that 5 year long darkened drama just to be countering(all laugh..lot)..anyway when i joined the Oak Labs,all everywhere disparaged all that's my,countering hallow never hi hence themselves fell silent when they had to choose between welcome or bye.. analysis look causality now Phantom(all un..)..so i just sent a report how many from even Pasio our most staunch opponents holistic is producing these great results and all and neither Dr Oak nor Lillie flower the owners anyway don't need any money to start with i said how can you claim anything as your own if your name is like Lillie flower(all laugh..lot).. it's impossible to live in things hence it's just the pieces of existential puzzle for each them and others too nothing else(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well about these nuances of the project Mango told me Dr Jackal and DaisyDevil suddenly put our elusive passing bar of dual ethics to rank impossibility now being too happy finding similar sort of beings(all laugh..lot)..said we only knew how you were this millenial being here to relief potential from procedure no wonder you went to the bushes without a Venonat(all un..)..anyway then my first cup there was this huge furore none in the world supported this scheme this time even Gemmie,Oskie and Penny abstained from voting forcing their beaus to the same and jointly cited the reason being personal inabilities in professionalized rather than applicable psychology of perception(all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) all past and current vetoed to stop it including Sakura and all barring Snorie,Slirrie,Redzie,Centie and Putu ofcourse they are never allowed to vote anyway cause it biases the outcome(all laugh..lot)..Dave and Irissalad doesn't understand the need for any voting cause optionality is just the Humdrum of presence they say(all un..),thankfully Mummy and Sruzie then Percy and Manthie and even Gabriel and Mateo they are a bit more sane(all laugh..lot) so all were against Master Brats except ofcourse Marc the Mr Litman no reasons needed(all un..,Iris..no Iris don't tell them that they did a commendable job tell them they did a equitable job as else it'll only make them egotistical not enthused to the cause of their expectations on self satiation..once my Breedril not doing thus failed to win a round hence i thought this,all un..,..Marc the Mr Litman,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot),he said his Oricorio once in a round asked him if he should listen to him or remember his teaching(all un..long time),to which i answered(all un..),the belief compeer else you get my intention not what my analysis tells me and thus how i intend to use it to get my intention thus you unless see my beliefs can only get what i desire not behind them what are my feelings(all un..long time) hence this being should be allowed to undertake these ideas else can't know if they were mere beliefs of being or belief itself in it's own being becoming the self-that feeling(all un..long time)..so this supported the crook as well who actually is the founder of these sort of training methods that his direct disciples got by the feelinng apprantly by their own actually just a mockery of what as another can be known(all laugh..lot)..anyway,then all there at the cup says your first brat will be Garchomp if you can't win one round with her you're going to jail for using substances(all laugh..lot),i was groomed to say no this is unfair but now remembered my teaching of saying to add-\njail : the defection of analogy from useful activity to  insightful productivity,countering necessary : the usefulness of necessity(all un..long time),so now i had to look at their belief in itself that's this meaning to add with else you'll be jailed-the most entailing(all un..long time),so i said if i win one I'll change him no matter she being my last brat cause every round is deemed discrete in self which you've not specified(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,Dawn un..)..\"\nMay(laughing..) : \"well Max said um..hey May if you were asked to validate yourself and you didn't agree to them did you start with saying this idea that has invaded your mentality and ended with hence you see mentality is a general term only that's unbiased thanks(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,Dawn un..)..i said may be when it was mom or dad(all burst..),um..no Mr Lubos was very scared with all this on being questioned Dawnny started with how she felt her behaviour is analyzed not due to what she was questioned but how she answered it(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..,Dawn too un..) and ended with hence i demand acknowledgement of my desire behind my motivations not whether or how i achieve it(all un..) then ended with my my my what a pleasure for thy only to derive in place of intelligible hallow a reactive hi i DEMAND freedom of what i'm taught for which I've been given a license now that how i apply ok(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..,Dawn un..)\"\nGus(laughing..) : \"yeah Dawnny always used this phrase i just convoluted it with experience(all burst..,Dawn un..)..man as much calm and methodical Combu and her rose were baby Dawnny exceeded everything(all laugh..lot)..we met her first and was thinking how has this sample been able to camouflage the existential self so well found out it was just behavioural impatience Mehu is only logically so nowhere near baby Dawn in terms of explosiveness(all laugh..lot)..\"\nMax(laughing..) : \"first time i said hallow Dawn,hallow MR Maximilian(all burst..,Dawn un..),so i knew this sort of a pest is going a long long way down darkness(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well this is how i was always irated there cause none listened to how they came to my intellect(all burst..)..first of all i never had any associations with master brats or Doctor Slate and so on cause neither mom nor dad liked them(all laugh..lot)..still now sometimes bro irritates them saying saw how her brat stopped her brats JUST to have an animation at home(all burst..)..so this is how everyone pester me always(all laugh..lot)..but now we all have found the counter to the Convene Skats the elder is never to be told Cerulean conference headship always collaborator any other word is viciously attacked in the particular case of Cerulean(all laugh..lot)..then the younger one is to be told like yeah in the reports(all laugh..lot),then there's a 1 hour long monologue on how to use words at Cerulean(all burst..)..and our HQ is here only barring Relations Doctors so people sometimes ask why they object to the city's name only when it's associated with their flowers(all laugh..lot)..we say well it's cause they both have to write reports by themselves which is viciously vetoed against as you know the rule introduced by Percy Kalos,Ivana dear yeah even her niece says this says no she's such a sweet little kid(all burst..)..then Windy sorry ma'am again all says they say she's ubiquitous to details(all un..) then finally the Mrs Cynatia(all un..long)..no they say she's untenable to squabble with ownself never satisfaction(all laugh..lot)..so they unanimously voted for it later Stu McShin changed a few rules along with Jasu like how the pokemons are to be mentioned without their problems but opinions(all un..long)..then the whole Ransei Elite4 are blindly infatuated with the Convene Skats since the end of time thus they're anyway not considered(all laugh..lot)..so,finally Marc The Mr Litman is there as their final say who says like no compeers when a report is written always mention if it was needed by the writer or expected by the evaluator you know once my Slurpuff didn't want to investigate the chasm between intention and want hence failed to win 3 advantaged rounds you know(all un..long,Iris..Marc The Mr Litman..no matters enquired,all un..long)..so these are the sort of brats that run the show now hence technical education has seen so much growth(all laugh..lot)..anyway you're not supposed to write the report as a gym leader or any yead yourself unless you're single or your spouse brat understand this term(all un..long) is in same profession then in physical cognition at full you should never write reports alone atmost if they can write mind another term fluently(all un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..but this isn't allowed for Cerulean alone cause all the flowers are ethereal in expression if they're not around their hubby brats or master brats or Lexical Sacks(all un..long)..so they do write  or each other(all laugh..lot) then i go to Professor Kukui for a starter and got Empol the the rockets intruded once more as ever thankfully for them the last time in their careers(all laugh..lot)..they i heard said we were told not to mingle with those brats after Hoenn cause they always suspected that Mehadi flower will vehemently object to end her her travelling days before atleast 23 years(all laugh..lot)..as Poppy flower was asked to manage the gym after her marriage which she did next time viciously namecalled DaisyDevil for not asking which wasn't received well(all un..long,..WaterFire,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) once that wasn't the case they tried it but Sinnoh was their stubbornness just anyway they came and all then Master Brat with Dashing Crook came first they did what they do then i ofcourse knew them all do master brats don't have any address actually it's impossible for them like how can it be comprehensive that one can find master brats to start with(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i didn't know about their works and all at all infact i just knew they were this strange thought provoking creatures(all laugh..lot)..anyway so i first of all saw the Dashing Crook(all laugh..lot) and instantly realized why even here all are around him like bunch of indolent fans(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i was going away from the convention that always takes place with Dashing Rock on this occasion(all laugh..lot) so i was going away on the gate they looked at me like was i out of this world(all laugh..lot),anyway i became the target of the rockets as i stepped out and so on existence played a game of chance with me you know(all laugh..lot)..anyway then crook asks of my health and all normal stuff takes half a minute(all laugh..lot) and they never ask for any specifications in such scenarios ever(all laugh..lot),so i have no idea why this idea came to my mind again a self to self tickling game i later found out(all laugh..lot) i said um..Mr Slate would you travel with me Professor can't travel with me and i wanted to travel alone but i don't understand these maps and all(all laugh..lot),well you can hook up with anyone,um..yeah but um..i just feel that it's exactly not nice cause i would start of as just a customer rather than a friend or something hence also i offered you to join me first than asking to accept me in your group(all un..,The Ethics of Moral Honesty,all un..),and the reply to those so exhorted views is(laughing)..Daftorabofajlitujerif(all un..long time)!..first of all Iris what does it mean(all un..)\"\nIris(laughing..) : \"no Ferdi don't move your head or eyebrows or anything barring widening your mouth when you shake hands else it's impossible to know whether you're acknowledging the actor's action or your own reaction..once my Omanyte couldn't draw a round due to this i remember(all un..long time,..Marc The Mr Litman,all un..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well i cursed myself so many tines for not being mindful of geography instruments(all laugh..lot)..anyway then at this i thought this must be a set up or something that name must be a code for something sinister that's gonna happen to me(all burst..) so i said,um..sorry but i didn't get if you agreed or just put me in your thoughts on what you were thinking before like suddenly from my conversations you've understood something sorry to say this but um..i don't know that word(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),the reply is,Vinjofidepaknasarapar(all un..)..this particular one Sirich would know(all laugh..lot)\nSirichai(laughing..) : \"um..yeah Genkie it was a great match against Ms Daphne,yeah but before coming out of the final fate did you first look at your badge then the gym the meaning is did you think about your badge's presence while looking at the gym or it's essence(all un..),um..i don't remember but when i was looking at the gym i felt like going back there right then not later and have the same match again it was so amusing,well you can have the same match with Karen,um..yeah but it's not the match but those moments how i approached it,you can simulate that too what made you aware of your presence not essence Sirich,um..well i guess i liked Daphne much(all laugh..lot),no no that's ok i like so many people you see i don't remember it anymore if i do or don't only the meaning of my refusal i can see as it means else nothing in being that is not self(all un..),um..no it didn't felt like ok how i did this and that the luck the decisions and all but um..it felt like that particular match was like i want to do everything again exactly the same no matter if i remember this or not like i don't really bother about anything like the outcome or else but i just liked this whole expression of this holistic witnessing of this very being included me the witness such i felt not just in terms of oh this experience you know it's like..,the presence of a stabilizing factor rather than enabling(all un..),um..yeah in terms of solution for being you can say(all un..),Vinjofidepaknasarapar!(all un..),um.. no she..,Kablatapajajnodiletom(all un..)..so i was very angry with these insinuations but as soon as this word insinuation came to my mind i thought of their types and instantly thought what the namecall am i thinking like saying Butterfree can't be an insinuation rather meaning if witnessing not in qualia can it(all un..long time),so now instantly I understood what i was saying so became a bit shy may be so said um..,Hiblocinemankubatofoz(all un..),i angrily said ok i like her um..(all un..,Dawn..Meaning Hands-On,all un..)..man it was just so true like i couldn't get rid of these absolute menaces whenever now i thought about Daphie so i was very angry and one day told Genkie enough of your diverting what do you want hum i just had a crush on her what's the big deal about it,Pikfenama..,hey hey,stop it ok(all un..long time,Genkai.. Pikfenamaralpumijehod,all un..long time)..so you see i was entangled in this horrible mess of dulality(all laugh..lot),so i was so irritated with them i couldn't forget Daphie at all which suddenly one day i understood as just to be-COUNTERING(all un..),so i told Genkie this is may be after a 2 weeks no more as at Frontier each day had 36 hours ATLEAST(all laugh..lot)..if you master asks if you're happy with something or not never mention the upper limit of happiness by only replying as yes no or could be..to be the most ENJOYING rhymes with waiting doesn't it Mr Salusar rhyming with if you are(all un..long time,..The Art of Starvation,all un..),so(all burst..) i thought i really wasn't anywhere when i heard these sort of discussion packages midmatch(all laugh..lot),anyway so i realized that Daphie was specially designed to be me(all laugh..lot),so i told Genkie ok fine i admit i'm infatuated with your dear little sis for longer than expected ok  what can i do about it i don't call her these days no more ok only called her twice last week(all laugh..lot),did she start with yeah rather than hallow or did she seem the most understanding when she said hallow(all un..),what sort of a question is this how can i say what she feels i can only say what i do,tell me the difference between this she and the she of Daphne(all un..),shut up ok why do you always talk about these days and why always change my opponents names in discussion if of your gender and don't allow me to interact with wild brats(all un..long time),you can't be without conservation of self Sirich against comprehension you're not really present at  invention of meaning rather interrogating what it means Sirich a description(all burst..),fare enough what does she say hum(all burst..),my time now goes to thee can you oppose(all un..)/this feeling of to be or pose(all un..)/my being now says that logic look plays(all un..)/in me thus self how can you repose(all un..)..says Hoopa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo pa pa pa Hoo(all un..),what's the difference then between this and infatuation then,why are you so worried about it Sirich it's just the meaning..any questions(all un..long time),so i said thus for 30 years you're picking each word out of lexicon to find their meaning against your relationship with you wife(all un..long time),the effective quiet(all un..long time,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja&Stash..Seldom Seldom Slalom/as Column ethical if not logical becomes situational jargon,all un..,..The Feathered Ones,all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i understood where it's gonna end up either you remember your spouse only during excretion else next flight Phantom(all un..long time),so after 2 more weeks total no more than 5 i said yeah i remember her all times if i want to in an abstract way,what's her(all burst..),ok she's all in me and ok i'll say these to her,Kimpuchiledabnupakulum(all un..long time)!,that why i can't be myself alone then if she's really all me fine i answer you she's only my superimposition on my self hence now appearing as my soul of differential being cause i want it's being as my not me take that you lowlife(all burst..),me only sends you to plurality Sirich what's the big deal(all burst..),ok ok anything so dear/reflection in me/i can't be separate/you're no more just thee(all laugh..lot,..Too Sweetie),atleast i didn't ask them to rather let her confirm my gender for a change(all un..long time),man what sort of a family i found myself u\nto belong to(all laugh..lot),so now anyway then me and Daphie spoke and all later she says i only said you were very nice that match couldn't have been anything else no matter how many times it replays,he's having a bit of air problem these days rhymes saw(all un..),so(all laugh..lot),Daphie being familiar with these sort of horrendous methods of thickening things said i went deep with washrooms (all un..)..man no wonder next time we saw each other physically was straight in the same registration centre end of journey where The Clinical Ones and The Feathered Ones all got their registration done 10 years prior the register was an elderly lady herself asked with so much glee on learning our story that the washroom is on the right any validation required(all un..),actually Daphie knew her she said she was there 10 years back as well then just about lost her twin sister to a disaster so was very dejected but had come to the office out of her 2/3 days vacation as she said it was done in Platue itself was a huge conference the event with the sort of witnesses that were their with their horrible ideas(all laugh..lot),so she said then they asked the office staffs if anyone has lost any direct family members to unnatural reasons this lady Mrs Stephanie i remember she said i said yeah then said they told me how my job opens up possibilities for me into the superimposition and identity actuations while i can pray for all and if there's a glitch i find then again pray and all and in return i can they said this word i can become a bit of a shrew so that to existence i can say rather than arising or setting what if i drew(all un..,Gus..hum,Civility!Education!Culture!,all un..,May un..long time)..man Drewy is something special you know being Cultured(all burst..,May un..)..so yeah this was one of my experiences i always tell everyone that i spent atleast 5 years in that one(all laugh..lot)..and yeah those names always comes up since Juritared atleast 2 each year and the preceding 13,5 more of them did(all laugh..lot) and each of those have paid their visits and those new imports stopped coming only 3 years back after 45 year vigil revealing 100 exact new brats(all laugh..lot),thankfully no bigger psychic than Ghostradarkarrigussonor has been found and that menace rejected these brats outright having no reason to be different at all(all laugh..lot)..ao ywah next time be prepared for that one 1000 years i realized in that 1 really isn't much in psychiatry(all laugh..lot) if distribute(all burst..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well for me those 2.5 years were 25 itself the whole traditionally accepted range of my physical youth(all burst..)..anyway then i said i didn't get it the meaning of Daftorabofajlitujerif the name Vinjofidepaknasarapar comes up,so now i thought they were challenging me(all un..),so i said um..excuse me but i don't believe i would've understood it before atleast 2/3 journeys if these words are related to pokemons(all burst..),says no Ms Berlitz cheer up you're going to have a great career ahead of you but just to be COUNTERING(all un..)..if only you can describe yourself physically when you excrete and mentally when you eat..shh..the most ENTAILING(all un..long time),i was sent to 7th hell absolute with their choice of words not the insinuation so said what do you mean i always clear my toilet myself and don't put my eyes off from my food if alone and don't move my head up and down that's enough that i can do if not all you too would admit i guess(all un..long time,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),money fame power gender wisdom compassion dissolution resolution which one do you want in exchange for addiction(all burst..),resolution ofcourse,it's rhetorical as i said countering(all un..long time),so i was so angry said i heard about your antics but not of your character(all un..,..DaisyDevil),yeah that feeling(all un..long time),now i shouted at both which they minutely listened to then asked did you shout because of your logic or your applicability(all un..),so now i was so irritated i said thanks but i've nothing to do with you two any more thanks(all laugh..lot),but that's a decision not resolution isn't it Ms Berlitz(all

is that i don't like them nothing more(all un..long time),i see so you advocate for resolution,well it's as i said just a pun..just to be COUNTERING(all un..long time),so i somehow spontaneously said,um..ok i like this scheme you will be traveling with me(all un..),the meaning is that you can't think of be or to be(all burst..),i said um..no i don't know these things i want to be a trainer(all laugh..lot),what are the things that you know Dawnny(all laugh..lot),just that that you should call me either Ms Dawn or Ms Berlitz or the full with status else how can i understand whom are you referring to you,your conceptions,my conceptions me the whole like both or all of us the whole presence and it could be so many more so i only know my name is assured nothing else is barring the status cause it's um..like in my hand(all un..long time,Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),STEELIX(all un..),are you inclined to(laughing..) physical sports(all un..long time),man Kumlie said the fight instantly stopped at this-expectations of physical or analytical results(all un..),said judges complained against both of us we brushed them aside saying this is 4th round so we gave all concerned all sorts of entertainment and it's a DQ show us the money and namecall off from here(all burst..)..it was an absolute mayhem after three amusing rounds same for the normal fighting schedule so they got that at IRSGC you know later all admitted to this and realized that the master brats have designed this horrendous scheme of sharing and preemptive measures in physically dangerous and mentally indolent situations(all laugh..lot)..Kumlie said both of were knackered as hell after 3 rounds cause none of us listened to our corners as we didn't like each other(all laugh..lot) the  in 4th we're so tired i tell the brat namecall this and started those games he being from Pettlesberg of all places only did the same(all laugh..lot)..anyhow i said now i'm inclined to mental sports i like a few board games and all i just do the stretching exercises and normal walks and all nothing more(all laugh..lot),which is your favourite stretching,um..just the sitting hooked cross leg and breathing in the end of a like 20 minutes i do that for 10(all laugh..lot),good get in that position,um..ok(all burst..),so ofcourse i kept my open which now they put a towel in front of me(all burst..),so i didn't say anything cause by then i understood they belonged to some very crude gang(all burst..),anyway no with this whole situation of non-physical sports(all laugh..lot)..now Dashing Rock and

nuzzle me(all un..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"so this continues for how long i don't know but i didn't want to open my eyes now it felt so absurd to have one just to see what's my,countering(all burst..)..anyway eventually after sometimes i couldn't stay sited no more so lied down but that stuff continued and i also kept my eyes closed and felt like yeah this whole ambience is really SO ENSUING(all burst..)..anyway then Guzzle Humdrum was only humming after that as you know it's so trifle the language to counter(all laugh..lot) anyway then eventually my got hold of me so i was relieved(all burst..) so i said,um..yeah how will our journey be then bro(all laugh..lot),the first answer is joint,oh feeling feeling don't you suspect me/as on you my dealing..now respect me(all un..long time),so i was like so spontaneously angry which how was possible I don't know still(all laugh..lot) and said in the similar way excuse the language cause that too was like spontaneousness of spontaneity,you b.. you can't go beyond reflection with counters ADMIT THIS(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..) and the reply is(all burst..),morning in only my eyes(all un..),look morning is thus sight's disguise(all un..),so i was so irritated with them again it was spontaneous said atleast it's not to counter but elaborate in conjunction rather than the conjunction the darkness itself ADMIT this you metaphorical b..(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),so now they said in unison,Dawnny please first THINK(all un..),so i was even more angry and said similarly i don't have to you b.. i know you forever you hide behind names to jump what i can't do like i said hence always intrude me in the name of i veiling ego(all un..,Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),now master brat became extremely serious instantly crook not so much but undertood the Feeling hence later told me(laughing..) felt not trying to feel more(all un..long time)..so(all laugh..lot),now master brat says indeed Ms Berlitz but who excretes and who eats that(all laugh..lot),um..but i don't know hence i want to travel with you(all burst..),well you don't need to you see cause you can do it yourself as you corroborated to me thanks(all laugh..lot)..now both goes out so i was desperate and said no i'll go with you too(all laugh..lot),well then you should meet us tomorrow evening after going through your processes and consulting with this person no more than twice and no less than never(all burst..) on your progress in-between Ms Sabrina Marnold,Saffron Gym Leader rest assured(all laugh..lot),so i according to timezones understood i can only contact once cause it was already 1 in the night you know otherwise master brats never talk serious matters(all burst..)..so anyway i researched about them and sank in this huge 30 year volume plus 3 preceding the manual Hands-On(all laugh..lot) and i didn't even know what was a Pokemon Lab i just wanted to be a trainer cause both my parents are(all burst..)..i just learnt how to handle pokemons and didn't know anything about psychics except theories never could manage them so i was just supposed to be this most ordinary trainer though i believed i could get atleast one contest with normal Pokemons cause it was possible all are pokemons why not(all laugh..lot)..hence Empol i managed well in a day itself anyway but i knew i only could handle grass,steel,ice and water types..electric,fire,fight,bug and posion i didn't understand one bit(all laugh..lot)..i had some knowledge of grounds but i never knew why rock is in the same group like i got flying types and normal types a bit but again their grouping as a couple meant there's more truth to fiction of ease(all laugh..lot)..steel type i got well ground the next so i thought ok rocks can't do much can they(all laugh..lot,.. Leading Rock,all laugh..lot)..yeah if only i knew(all laugh..lot)..then next was fly last was normal so i thought ok i can't go beyond atleast ground/normal mix(all laugh..lot)..water/ice was second best steel third and grass types i knew pretty well hence thought ok i can manage darks and fairys psychics i can't i know it too but ghosts i heard is just playful so i thought ok they won't be mine so why would they want me to be them(all laugh..lot)..then i didn't know any valley except where grass pokemons were found and for water/ice i just wanted to visit the southern commons for long with like 10 grass types(all laugh..lot)..steel I thought well if i can get good but i'm not going to search many places and which will those places be at all i'll learn where to find them on the go(all laugh..lot)..then i didn't know about authority,champions,general training,special training even(all laugh..lot),research,medicine_test nothing i didn't even know how to be a gym leader no i didn't know i had no interest in these things(all laugh..lot) i only learnt the contest rules and the breeders and doctors(all laugh..lot)..no i really didn't know i tell you(all laugh..lot,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all laugh..lot)..and the month after this day i had a Cobalion which Mango later explained was caught by purely abstract sensitivization of () planes(all laugh..lot)..anyway(all laugh..lot) so then i thought with the brats who grasped me doesn't care a fig for any specifications surely so i just decided to do what i knew 24/7 since someone snatched away my lollypop as a kid at second sem school then when i grabbed her,her twin bro came over and alone overpowered me by pulling my hair(all burst..) to this his sis laughed so much saying see boys have more power than us..nana(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i was so happy dad wasn't there among us for guidelines(all burst..,Bazugh,David,Sirichai,Iris,Marlon and Bonnie,May,Melody un..) anyway that was the only thing i knew the biasing and unbiasing and it's neutrality i knew everything about it later read so much about rights and all the only things that the master brats didn't consider at all cause they're only derivatives of ADMINISTRATION and POLICING..the most Encouraging(all un..),anyhow(all laugh..lot)..so of course those had been deepened far more just to be countering obviously(all laugh..lot)..that's all i knew and read the social this and that hence only failed the sociology papers cause i knew too much for society(all burst..)..and that was such a wrong choice you know i found out Hands-On(all laugh..lot,..Civilization,all laugh..lot)..anyway so i returned to now what the master brats did with general public at certain issues then saw that there's no end to it cause that is all about them(all laugh..lot)..now it already was 3 in the night(all laugh..lot)..so i slept for 3 hours woke up at 6 meaning it's now about 13 at Saffron so tried to contact Sabrina first up with the intention to talk about pure grass type training(all laugh..lot)..so i call her,um..hallow Ms Marnold i'm Dawn Berlitz..,ah Dawnny you bros told me about you today morning here(all laugh..lot),um..thanks Ms Marnold um..,no it's ok dear i also don't have much time today itself there had to be so much pressure they told me they think you're best suited for medicine test actually(all laugh..lot) to check that infact you can read this article i once had to give this talk from dark type point of views and they recorded it here this is the name best wishes dear i'll be free later call me then(all laugh..lot),so i thought this is a trap to defame me(all laugh..lot)..anyway the day before i didn't look up Sabrina now i do and again there's so much work about Haunter(all laugh..lot)..but i just got how these brats spoil so many truly great people(all laugh..lot) anyway then i went to that talk didn't understand even the words why they were in a sentence I didn't know anything(all laugh..lot)..anyway so then it's breakfast time and i went in now instantly recalled about its emphasis so was attentive to it then i just tried to do that staying attentive after food but couldn't so i thought ok i'll do some kind of mentation which i did all the time till it was evening Sabrina wasn't available whole world was channelized into Saffron ofcourse i too undertood how(all laugh..lot)..so i didn't like it how they were deceiving me hence i just went back doing those mentations thinking about that song rather the meaning ofcourse(all laugh..lot) and yeah Empol was snatched away from me the day before(all laugh..lot) so i did those mentations and all till it was evening when i go to meet them and i see Simile Popcorn doing the rhythm i instantly thought of that very song with both her feets and finger on ger nose with breathing exercises and the feet movements was of a strange pattern later learnt how regular jumping rope can become so horrendous a methodology of THE MEANING(all laugh..lot)..so i said,um..hallow Ms Ketchum i'm Dawn Berlitz i was told to come here at this time to meet Mr Stash and Doctor Brock so i guess you're here for that(all laugh..lot),no i'm not sorry(all laugh..lot),um..ok but um..can you tell me..,no no i don't know about them they left before i came and Stashey never keeps a number Brock is unreachable i too tried sorry to disappoint you Ms Berlitz(all laugh..lot),um..but um..do you know anything about me(all laugh..lot),no more than what you said just previously no more(all laugh..lot),um..ok sorry to disturb you Ms Ketchum,take car..,Himjabifemultepik(all un..),i really thought i wasn't but was this creatur.. what is wrong with me(all un..,Serena..Reticence Vat,all un..long time),so i really didn't understand anything but none of the other people did either(all laugh..lot),then she says in front of all this is Ms Dawn Berlitz,Pokemon Master,Gallery of Fame,8,8,8,8,no situational discritization,the most emotionally continuing\nthanks(all un..)..zapped me off with her to where how could i have known as i didn't even understand how zapping worked(all laugh..lot)..now i was zapped to this room where instantly someone blindfolded and gagged me next thing i knew i was in this dark cave with a fire at the outlet with an extremely strange looking creature sitting beside it poking the fire with an iron stick singing(all laugh..lot)..\ngo to sleep..go to sleep go to sleep my name\nas AND : the Hologram of Is(all un..) poke dreamy eyes and the little thing hollers MEH(all un..long time,..Daily Hologram,all un..)..\ni now was so angry and frustrated and scared and all i shouted you b.. what do you want huh,what's a b..,shut up you b.. I've had enough of this,what is p..(all burst..),shut up ok they are anger and frustration i'm only annoyed..um..(all un..,..Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),HYDREIGON(all un..)..and four of those menaces appear beside me(all laugh..lot),i said hey i know who you are but why are you playing these games with me,next moment i'm unconscious next moment first time i had so much pain in my head as i hear with a prototype translator the most raw version rest are deemed(laughing..) empty of interest(all un..long time),so(all laugh..lot) then i had this sensation and i it's as if someone saying in my mind a thought comes from outside not of my own like,gaming not male is the fiction of your desire to be unprepared isn't it rhyming with how so it(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i didn't know anything but i was so scared so i said despite all the psychic pain cause it too was spontaneous infact i didn't know till then what's spontaneous fear and spontaneous memory(all un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot) then somehow i said that,but fiction requires a commitment to exploration by gaming i'm only trying to redirect my trepidation towards affirmation so how is your choice of desire valid with unpreparedness rather should be my intention to unpreparedness so that i can insure my attempt not aim(all un..,Lady Dawn Groudon,all un..),then they said,rhyming with solvable not experiential claim isn't it(all un..),no i couldn't remember what i said but i was there that i remember with Daily Hologram getting rid of my translator intervening in the process this process i had to learn sadly too this only Daisy,Mehadi,Poppy,Brock and Lillie know except the direct brats of the dark clan only the trainers know that is Gladie,Gus,Gungie,Gary and ofcourse The Feathered Ones,Dr Jackal understands the process unlike each of them but can't execute unlike each of them dual equanimity the observing detachment(all un..long time)..and Doctor Slate can't execute it only make the concerned two help to FEEL it(all un..,Gladys,Guang,Gus,Genkai and Blossom..Dialga don't be a gambler just looking as yourself is,all un..,..Thus understand that you the feeling..is only what here AMISS,all un..,..That Feeling,all un..)..anyhow(all burst..),this brat learnt it all by himself obviously (all laugh..lot,.. Leading Rock,all laugh..more),and he passed it onto DaisyDevil whose style demands each skill but no tricks in the book the characteristics that is not actually those as they're granted to being(all burst..,..DaisyDevil),then Lillie flower stumbled upon it herself ofcourse then was restrained from not mingle with these in an underwater volcano all alone thus certainly in that geography never lone(all laugh..lot) and no except Gungie,Gus,Gladie and The Feathered Ones none of us can apply it on anyone(all laugh..lot) but yeah master brats never required to know or do as you know(all burst..)..and the flowers are too sweet as you know they can't do these at all unless their own hubbies(all laugh..lot)..and no Viol flower doesn't know it cause it's psychic knowledge completely abstract and absolutely tacit has to be handed down(all laugh..lot)...Dr Oak knows it but you know never needs it cause if you're anyone and Dr Oak turns up then it's always so special especially if say you're his newborn sis and baby bro and and your beau lives the next home(all laugh..lot)..\"\nGladys,Genkai and Blossom(laughing..) : \"excuse me Gary i..hush Professionalism!(all un..) did your self suffered a stroke(all un..)/so that now you're not patient enough to learn the consent hence discombobulate logical progress(all un..) hence just Dr Oak(all un..,Clemont,Bazugh,Marlon and Bonnie..An Iss..Hush! generalization!,all un..,a being must have,to clarify own self,a professional tissue..anything else on it's generalization,all un..long time,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"so(all laugh..lot) such a brat is agnostic of skills(all burst..)..and no a few others may know but none in the known ranks know it and i'm sure they can't apply it if say a Ghostradarkarrigussonor calm max full wild(all burst..) turns upon Professor or grandma or Cippie(all laugh..lot)..that only these 5 menaces can do but again master brats never needed it or the fact that it's tacit you know they are completely knowledge proof(all un..)..man what sort of creatures these are(all laugh..lot) and yeah obviously you don't need to know or do anything if you know what's Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..but the only difference to all including Gungie and rest is that they learnt everything only after Saffron and then they spent all their lives till then surrounded by pokemons and i only knew about non psychic grass types(all laugh..lot) and was forced into one of the most elusive facets of their skillset before i could register(all burst..)..with 4 most evolved record setter Hydreigons trained by a being never person named Daily Hologram with a most raw prototype translator that was rejected the first later(all laugh..lot)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..no wonder i couldn't find any word called solace(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Daily Hologram sticks with me for my safety as i was communicating with Hoodie,Huddie,Hydro,Hydru(all laugh..lot)..i when  woke up saw how Raki treats his brats as if all of them including him are 3 year olds(all laugh..lot)..but anyway when i woke up i first saw Raki and i was gagged and deafened i couldn't talk or hear anything(all laugh..lot),then just saw what he was doing with his brats for sometimes then he left and Lixue came in untangled me and gave me some food that was so delicious which i learnt later one from the collection of Pewter Dish(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Lixue first forcefully fed me holding me up herself they never required any assistance in that as never knew what it means in application only what it means in rendition(all un..,..Simile Popcorn,all un..), anyway so i tasted it was great food and she fed me throughout then washed my hands i only had to wash my mouth(all burst..) and only then i was allowed to talk and this is my first record as my communicator was returned to me(all laugh..lot)..so i put it out as record she didn't have any recorders..\"\n\n after much fuss win and all so yeah out of all this very start was THE most memorable(all laugh..lot)..some people asked me which journey was better first or last..first ofcourse is first ever in Frontier system(all laugh..lot) but they said no in the last you were so assured(all laugh..lot) i said well i by then had enough not to be so and had to foster my sonny as well(all laugh..lot) but i old Gustie too day 1 that it wasn't first journey it was a textbook to all who wants to get prepared to see The Elusiveüêâ(all laugh..lot)..and then what to do there is actually all the same like Kanto same setup same everything but the Gyaradoses had the incentives Irissalad didn't have any damn thing to do with them except the same number of journeys and the assurance of the Elite4 shot hence volunteered to jump into Unova with thankfully a Haxorus atleast(all burst..)..oh yeah i also was told that they always patronized why neither Poppy nor Mehadi were chosen in you place hum(all un..),i said you need assistance way more than I'll ever require cause you believe you cam answer someone asking you to confirm his or her gender while giving the rigour behind you reasoning(all un..,..The Darkened Ones,all un..,Gus un..)..or can answer if it were you the questioner was talking to not your sense faculties reflecting the fact that you were sure you were talking with someone particular rather than logical(all un..,..The Clinical Ones,all un..,Guang un..)..and Dave knows very well what was going on at Veilstone so perfect name as well for exactly that(all laugh..lot)..man i heard the Great Boss said that that journey was the SOLE reason why we involved the lower foot tactics cause if the best of profession can't hack a teenager what would you do when Kimmie the Kommo-O comes to have metaphysical tea with you(all burst..)..and in the end i wasn't abducted to Unova to sort myself out only as you know they themselves did that but from Unova the younger and most hideously from under the cover the elder hence that mess was created..and yeah my routine was like that today i'll be at the southern commons tommow at Surelectric Valley whereas yesterday i was at Linoluni Ranges(all laugh..lot)..then the same month 2 cups 2 gyms next month 2 gyms and 2 contests again after having a bash at Lyfostrafos ofcourse the day before a contest or so(all laugh..lot)..and yeah each were class of eminences or run by book of distinctions(all laugh..lot)..then at Johto some said man it doesn't get any better than that can it like it's so EXCITING(all burst..) then said why would you think about personal life man what's in it so ENTICING(all un..)..i said if only what you said comes in psychic and emotional channels from plane agnostic menaces that isn't going to be found before atleast a millenia you'll know indeed it was so ensuing(all laugh..lot)..and i always say these cause it was like i started at 17 and 7 after completing one of my sociology papers the month before mind the subject(all burst..) and it was cause i failed in the written but passed the demonstrative meaning i didn't cheat atleast unlike a few(all laugh..lot,May.. Civility Hands-On,all burst..,Gladys,Genkai and Blossom,Guang,Gus..Stash un..),so(all laugh..lot) then at 17 and 7 i started and ended at 20 and 3 with the ultimate possiblities of my present profession having been all done and dusted there's nothing left to do good night have a nice life and i was 20 and 5 rhymes saw(all burst..)..but yeah May it would've been a piece of cake for someone like your beau why would he reject this opportunity just for sake of education(all burst..)\"\nMay(laughing..lot) : \"why cause i come from a CULTURED family ok(un..,all un..)..man my üåπ was tormented like nothing but still said thank God each time i had enough civility to make sure they leave me alone to travel around DESTINY(un..,all un..)..and no Pasio was a special journey for both of us but it was nothing like Sinnoh man that was massacre of general training profession(all laugh..lot)..all knew Unova was coming and it did come but then Crawdauntogator was another level that none realized how was possible like that Kalos Final with the subsequent bro vs beau hallucinations that's not happening again no way not in temporal scales only existential definitely(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well once i went to a psychiatrist she said Ms Berlitz cheer up life is always about in self feeling not being a possibility fuelled decision(all burst..),i said yeah thanks that feeling(all un..)..man it's just impossible to reject the that dark clan once you've been part of it(all laugh..lot)..then once at a pub some asked hey Dunnie how's the drinks after party heard they are the MOST expensive(all un..),so i was embroiled in a melee as an answer(all laugh..lot) which was true but psychic channel and personal life are never going to conjoin always transposed(all laugh..lot)..and well still first final was Mr Georges next one and only Melody(all laugh..lot)..and these brats were so happy at Sinnoh cause they could babysit her and irritate me all they wanted all the time while dictating poor Johnny Lad's psychological states then via proxy only(Melody bursts..,all laugh..lot)\"\nMelody(laughing..) : \"well that journey was something else for me after around 6 years of upheavals(all laugh..lot) and yeah these brats were too happy most of the times i travelled with the The Feathered Ones(all laugh..lot) along with Yummie and  Simile Popcorn and Daily Hologram as our preceptors who as a pair was a horrendous torture on duality(all laugh..lot),anyway(all laugh..lot),then next group started with Lillie flower(all laugh..lot) who was with Gladly Syndrome(all laugh..lot) and ofcourse the tuple of Lastly Phantom and Shadowy Lantern the most engulfing team for duality atleast their elder ones weren't physically violent(all laugh..lot) they always brought two hand combat pads along when they argued were doing the physical exercise as well which Niji always hit and Ash ducked(all burst..) their elder ones were happy with only the completely wrong only not to them the full match shadows(all un..) and all of these menaces were the entourage of Incentive Overdose(all laugh..lot) who always brought her own personal security thus that was bro(all burst..)..and our group most times were divided into me,Genkie and Lixue and Blossie,Yummie and Raki whereas Vigil was kicked away to Sinnoh after the very second journey at Pasio and didn't meet Yummie till she ended her journey he always complained to us how inhuman this setting was that he had to peek from Hoenn this time(all laugh..lot) then when Lillie flower was there she went always with Gladly Syndrome hence both were always at risk(all laugh..lot) so Weather Chat managed Lillie flower and Lastly Phantom was controlling Gladie's effusiveness the only ones except Margin and Blithie who could(all laugh..lot)..with Jubilee Hands-On you don't become anything only Hands-On(all burst..) anyway then after this finally bro was left to manage Incentive Overdose(all laugh..lot) while always poking both her and her beau's relationships always that was shown separate hence both were mad and returned the difference of the join(all un..) anyhow(all laugh..lot) so then the final set was baby Dawn who was at the care of Dashing Crook(all laugh..lot) and was finally left to consult with anytime anyplace -Master Brat anything else(all burst..),apart from how to understand life not just understand life(all un..) as it was taught by Loaf and Toast(all burst..) man it's so true what Dawnny just said it was a textbook to the practice of meeting The Elusive üêâ certainly she got hands-on dragonic teachers literally along with Ms Volbeat's translation courses on emotional existence and obscurity(all laugh..lot)..but yeah the Kanto Beginning with the disciples with their flowers hosted by the twin paring of the opposing versions of the master brats along with master brat managing Gladly Syndrome and The Feathered Ones doing the rounds in-between never together(all laugh..lot) with finally the Leading Rock being the head of this whole band that entourage of sanity(all burst..) certainly was out of this world absolutely(all laugh..lot)..still it's like daily novels so May travelled with a strange set of brats actually(all laugh..lot)\"\nMay(laughing..) : \"well unlike each atleast i was well educated before going out if not made cultured over that as a bonus(all un..)..and ofcourse when you're with Dr Jackal or Mr Vreen or Dashing Crook you don't think about civility even Melody literally hit Brock so many times who was 41 and Melody was 32(all burst..,Melody un..,..Dashing Dashing Rock)..but well i travelled with Cladly and Scarlie throughout that was something(all laugh..lot)..no i literally travelled with all that was at Hoenn then with as usual Doctor Slate as personal sweeper (all laugh..lot)..of those FEELINGS (all un..,..THAT FEELING..shh..so NA√èVE,all un..)..man no wonder only someone as outrageous as Ms Volbeat could better the Dashing Rock(all laugh..lot)..but just a thing Gladie how was the travel of DaisyDevil(all laugh..lot)\"\nGladys(laughing..) : \"look observing your self is a management bully with recurrent characterizations in hand(all un..)/look now is forwarding the dissent of having induction rather than perception in your character's hand(all un..,..DaisyDevil)..well still it wasn't like our Ransei holidays atleast(all laugh..lot)\"\nBlossom(laughing..) : \"excuse us but we're searching for Mr Vitor Vuhagob,we see welcome welcome it's gonna be pretty long(all laugh..lot),Sir 'mam it's ok we could..(all laugh..lot),why not sonny whole world know your..,but it could also be called contravention(all un..),who the namecall is this and why has he appeared of the blue(all burst..)..no no i was always here just before you mentioned me i just was a bit..um..as me contagious(all un..),oh yeah..,STOP! IT'S THAT JACKAL OF Detached Observation(all un..) read his words properly of being notionally contagious..\nlook in my eyes..what would i see(all un..)/the bush of observable eligibility(all un..)/from there i see your anger,and i see your dream(all un..)/just cause i'm the you in what you as i seem(all un..)/thus oh compeers..don't ask for my visibility(all un..)/as look i'm the jackal of believability(all un..)/as i'm the ü¶ä of rationality(all un..)/oh mental Police the jackal of authority(all un..)/Oh Cerulean..look has finally in rhymes come..from the bushes of ego-The ü¶ä of personality(all un..,..Dr Jackal,all un..)..man when jackal arrived after 16 years and a quarter it was just impossible to describe what happened to each concerned planes(all laugh..lot)..and that fight glimpse was something else as well Gus would tell you his Gyarados only understands what he does if with him the counter to non self black box exactly why that drama played so perfectly for the casual onlookers(all laugh..lot,..The Darkened Ones,all burst..,Gus un..)\"\nGus(laughing..) : \"well atleast we weren't mingling in prepositions never conjunctions(all un..)..anyway after the Rocketeers relieved us we were in a difficult physical situation so somehow made the shore then all of us fainted and well i only made it because Mehu was there no matter how weak cause any of the WaterFire's become invigorated in only those two elements the more raw the better always Gungie only got that at Dark Nights(all un..)..anyway then she herself fainted and i anyway fainted before so Arct and Pullie were there to watch over who only poked both of us in unconscious too we realized just was in nervous agony(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i wake up first as Mehu fainted only trying to get me to wake up so fainted right upon me which meant i was in more danger cause she anyway weighs 75 kgs(all laugh..lot)..but later she told me if it were The Feathered Ones Slalom Seldom would heal herself by the process of nonchalant haste itself something Mehu when told said but that i can only practice out of emotion(all burst..) was told a piece that came as 'Practice : the motion of virtuality'(all un..,..The Feathered Ones,all un..)..anyhow(all laugh..lot),then i wake up to actually my brats forcing me to wake up as that was told to them if they sensed anything and felt i was out for too long for Mehu's comfort never mine you know that's not in consciousness(all burst..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so anyway i wake up somehow to a person who unlike Mehu or Brock or Ash or anyone was interested more to see if i was detached from being physically unconscious now for some logic(all un..) so then i saw a very handsome man in his late 20s it seemed had a hairband on forehead with half shorts and a green shirt and shoes all green(all laugh..lot) and his look was exactly like he sees you and sketches you in himself as again the i in both observes(all burst..)..so then i said yeah thanks Sir,first words were,um..yeah,but your compeer is still unconscious we should get her back,i said how Dr Oak taught us to think in this physically dangerous situations as hmm..Pokemon Master..hmm..(all burst..)..observing THEN learning..hmm..(all un..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so i said yeah it's ok then he did the major work in helping Mehu up who also said thanks Sir thanks for saving us,no problem 'mam,Sir it's ok it's natural for anyone get yourselves comfortable,so we both now said,hmm..(all burst..),anyway then on the road to nearest centre says how he found us and all well none asked ever who we were since we were 4(all laugh..lot) anyway then ofcourse in reply to why my brats did do what he old them says oh i'm a researcher and pretty travel experienced too this is my 4th journey very last one was Unova itself(all laugh..lot) so i have the experiences first hand and all but suddenly a bell rings in my head as to how he looked at me then didn't return my thanks rather brushed it aside then when it was said for unison returned it saying 'mam BEFORE Sir so i said hang on what does he know of appropriation of spontaneity(all un..),so then after we reach the centre in like 2 minutes zapping(all laugh..lot) these were again just the consolidation phase so got 10/15 minutes so then i said well i have a few questions Nr Skechit that is cause you know from where i belong(all laugh..lot) so i just wanted to ask why you only replied to both our greeting in unison,then i see as if so much surprised says,no no you two were there together hence it was only ethical to reply to us than we you know these very well but you only said me cause it was spontaneous but then i thought ok in dulality it's discombobulating always the existence to look at hence had to wait till you recall the dual WE but then again it's spontaneity that physical verbosity or movement suddenly out of directional categorization from it's abstract form it might be hard for you to say WE before my get attached to my claim of being myself rather than the observer from it so then to help you also i pointed your attention to the WE in honesty without replying the thanks to be moral about my perception anyway thanks Mr Ketchum this opportunity to self rather than it's action(all un..,..Dr Jackal,all un..),so i hardly managed to control myself from not send him as a ping pong between Arct and Pullie(all burst..) so i laughed and said yeah thanks but Mehu was smiling still understanding things so just before she's sent for checking i said thanks I won't need it Mehu too understanding something stopped expressing her dissent at me turning it to our facilitator(all laugh..lot),i said it's ok you go it's ethics(all burst..),so she goes and she had to wasn't ok for me and Gungie that's not a problem cause we had to practice physical spontaneity whole day with master brats from 1.5 to 3.5 Hands-On too(all laugh..lot) which none else did physically certainly not if in conjunction cause The Feathered Ones first hand said not going to happen(all laugh..lot) and neither Margin himself testified  nor Dr Oak or Gladie or anyone else did that we were sure hence she goes i stay(all laugh..lot) now before she actually goes Dr Jackal observes the whole situation similarly and gets up saying you should go too Mr Ketchum i'll wait for you and your friend to come out of the your troubles we'll meet then(all laugh..lot),then after that he himself actually comes in and we were sitting together so now normally talks also about it(all laugh..lot) so i was so irritated with my deduction powers(all burst..)..then anyway the language of ours were prepared Professionally for me and Personally for her(all burst..)..so he laughs and all then goes away but then we were talking about the brats and all anyway he told us will see Goldy,Tiffin,Arct and Pullie the only ones we had with us so then next day he says yeah thanks for letting me examine them it's nice to meet you etc verbal garbage(all laugh..lot),so now i said well i want to ask the things you studied at your research course Mr Skechit we've done not always a justice to it(all laugh..lot),again so naturally says no no it's only going to be an injustice if it were made stagnant at being not self Mr Ketchum cause formulation is impossible from actuative implementation rather than potential applications thus possible here is only axioms(all un..),so now Mehu asks him Mr Skechit my last caught mate is a Pyukumuku and her distinct feature is that she likes to play\"\n\n\nso i was in absolute heaven to be able to meet Dr Jackal in psychophysical being(all laugh..lot) so now i contacted Lixue and asked her what you'd you see if you find the jackal as a researcher(all laugh..lot)..\"\nLixue(laughing) : \"look that's a ü¶ä of ensuing (all laugh..) thus is the Dr of self sufficiency that's   success's Jackal(all un..)..with a pen just to be moral to the memorial dual hand(all un..)/look hops around the professional bushes(all un..)..to catch the self in personal sand(all un..)/oh it's a jackal of representation (all un..)..thus sketching what IS the you(all

is a qualification competition.\nIt is held across 8 regions each region has 2 centres.\nIt consists of 10 Different Categories.\nA competitor may chose either of the 10 or all of them. If all of them are chosen then it fan be done either in class A or in class B. Hence there can be total 12 different varieties of the competition.\nNamely,\n1.Vigilance\n2.Patience\n3.Perseverence\n4.Intelligence\n5.Ardour\n6.Commitment\n7.Meticulousness\n8.Flexibility\n9.Prudence\n10.Assurance\n11.All Together Class A-> Consistence\n12.All Together B-> Insistence\nMinimum Qualification age for a competitor is more than exact 17 years and Maximum criterion is less than 21 years and exact 9 months.\nA Competitor must retire at earliest before 67 years 1 month an exact day day and at latest 67 years 7 months and an exact day.Retirement happens only twice a year in the last day of first and last day of 7th month of a year.Competitor starting at latest at less than 17 years 11 months and exact 2 days gets to stay in relevance for 50 full years excluding the retirement month.Anyone starting later will have to retire before 67 years and exact 1 month or 67 years and 7 exact months whichever be earlier.Each region can be contested for atmost once barring Category Consistence.Competitors can't change category more than twice within first three competitions starting with any category.The latest or the most frequented category whichever is applicable will have to be competed in from 4th.Between any two competitions atmost 6 months can be taken as break.For Category Consistence Home region must be competed for twice the second time for 1 year barring the starting month the first time for 2 years and 8 months barring the starting month.Out of 8 regions the competition length for 2 regions in this category is 1 year and 8 months excluding the starting month.\nCompetition for Consistence is held each month of a year and at all 9 different centres together exclusively. So in a year there can be 9*12=108 new winners.\nThe highest achivement for this category is to win 7 to 9 competitions.Then participate in a Selector Competition for Hall of Fame which will take 1 year and 6 months including the starting month competing across all 8 regions against a selected group of the existing hall of famers in each region.If a desired number of such hall of famers of a certain region are defeated then that region is won.Thus the maximum score can be 8-0 win.the minimum qualification for getting into hall of fame is at worst 5-1-2 score(win-draw-loss).\nAtmost how many persons may be present as a champion in each category( from 1 to 6,7+ who failed to reach hall of fame and who are in hal of fame) in any given month excluding the starting and retirement month of a Competitor has started at the earliest?in each monthly regional competition atmost 512 people may enter\nFor Insistence,For Category Insistence each region must be contested for but atmost once.For 6 regions the competition span is 2 years and 5 months barring the starting month.Out of 8 regions the competition length for 2 regions in this category is 1 year and 4 months excluding the starting month(The same distribution of time span is followed in equivalence to Category Consistence with 3 less months in each case.).\nCompetition for Insistence is held each month of a year and at all 8 different regions together exclusively. So in a year there can be 8*12=96 new winners.\nThe highest achivement for this category is to win 6 to 8 competitions.Then participate in a Selector Competition for Gallery of Commemoration which will take 6 months including the starting month competing across all 8 regions against a selected group of the existing Gallery of Commemoration members in each region.If a desired number of such members of a certain region are defeated then that region is won.Thus the maximum score can be 8-0 win.the minimum qualification for getting into hall of fame is at worst 5-1-2 score(win-draw-loss).\nAtmost how many persons may be present as a champion in each category(from 1 to 5,6+ who failed to reach Gallery of Commemoration and who are in it) in any given month excluding the starting and retirement month of a Competitor has started at the earliest?in each monthly regional competition atmost 128 people may enter.\nFor both categories one may pull out of this system afte
