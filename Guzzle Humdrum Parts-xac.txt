augh) then finally there was our Lillie wig(laugh) and she since 14 till 32 for 18 years 10 relations 5 serious 4 advanced and she married at the age of 37,5 years later,then sweet sweet Gary bro(laugh) some crushes and hangouts and so on too type specified and too much intellectual and outragious once they wanted to be personal in talks(laugh) and this all till he was 17 before journey(laugh) starting from 12(laugh) then at travel first year a bit no hangouts still(laugh) then at 18 a brat jumped but that was it really for him that brat was a crush that too 2 years back just was talking with her then at that time the crush didn’t exist was there just in all due honesty in ethical honesty,just my Guzzlord repeats these all times(both laugh) and the crush had the same in viseversa but that incident finally took the illusion off from my sweet bro..and Mehu flower devoured me up totally first sight and then I didn’t call her from her own phone so a few brats were around 2 then and there understood they were in illusion another just got Salamenced(laugh) that brat is too fond of me now wants to be Gengar and his soulmate doesn’t hence was complaing to me(laugh) recorded my conversation on how to tame intruding Palkias and bing human-Gengar(laugh) loaths you now cause of the illusion(laugh) hence at last fed you the card that you should’ve jumped into Unova and Kalos and so on says all family drama all sisters pawned the lesser half you didn’t want to so Daisy forced 3 to pawn on me(burst into laughter)..and Lillie’s 10 were 10 year illusion only for Dr Oak Dr Oak as Giratina says light is dark/dark is light/happy now Mr Oak but Mr Oak now why not so bright(both burst into laughter)..just my Giti(both laugh) master in momentary analysis of all changes and then there’s Zeraora from Kalos, Dr Oak Dr Oak what are doing/Oh Mr Oak please help me I’m ruing/Dr Oak Dr Oak why a Zeraora is a pokemon(both burst into laughter)/tell me now Mr Oak don’t you know else you’ll bemoan(both burst into laughter)..if a new person or pokemon goes to any of my brats we see new import(both burst into laughter) what’s thy chosen name(both burst into laughter)..and Ultranercozma says too many types why not each then the mix in the end again start from zero just like sleep and with your beau your trip is there ever that perfect fix(both burst into laughter)..my Cozy sweetie(both burst into laughter)..so you understand Mehu about my nature(both laugh)..but nothing is full without my sweet Mehu flower(both smiles at each other)..and no I did go too far, maybe I should call her won’t sleep I guess though Gary was more than happy..” Mehadi(smile) : “its ok dear,no need to disturb them today again,we’ll be there just let the sun rise for(laugh) those Choiced brats as well(both laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “yeah I surely have a few works left here before I can go to Pasio” Mehadi(laugh) : “So true.Man,you gave all of us a real scare,and when are you going to send your acceptance for the Hall of Fame position?” Seth(tired) : “Ah! Mehu,all in good times and there’s so much more to talk about that isn’t so easy please dear not now,I’m too tired want to sleep in your arms” Mehadi(smile) : “so do I,Seth.” Seth(excited): “but you know what,I’ve never thought before,but I guess today I helped to make a phrase easier for me and may be many as well” Mehadi(smirk, oy) : “what is it that you’re doing behind me,hum,Seth Ketchum?” Seth(laugh) : “relax Mehu Ketchum(both smile),I feared I’ll have go down far far more” Mehadi(frown) : “Seth it’s not funny you know,you were self mortifying yourself,no matter your true motives and intentions” Seth( ehadi) : “perfect time”
Mehadi(surprized) : “huh?!?”
Seth(smile and  ehadi) : “All this trouble was taken up to pick up my sweet flower from the Cerulean Frowers.Happy now?”
Mehadi(laugh) : “it’s too used everywhere actually,we’ve rather grown tired with just about anybody spitting this one out anywhere,they may have a few songs as well”
Seth(smiling and immitating one of the Cerulean Flowers songs from the City) : “the beautiful flowers from Cerulean Gym/the flowers that of which I always dream/Dase,Viol,Mehadi(tenders Mehadi,Mehadi laughs) and Lil/all or one(hugs Mehadi very firmly,Mehadi laughs)/just bring me some/give my heart the perfect heal”
Mehadi(smirk) : “Seth, it’s not exactly pleasing if you were there” Seth(smiling) : “hey,I was there remember,I guess I also was in this body as well to see the fun..(laugh)..besides we’ll be back to the gym anyway” Mehadi(laugh) : “you would’ve been killed picking up fights with just about everybody in the crowd”
Seth(laugh) : “I guess I would’ve.but they had to surpass Metagross and still GROUDON(bot laugh)..yeah any can be here at this moment none can detect except me if they so want(both laugh)..and of course Metagross can be anywhere(both laugh) who now says hallucinations ends so does a phonemena in reality master brat are you sure you have to attack(laugh,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs)..no more words(both laugh)..but I still have a complain to make”
Mehadi(laugh) : “what is it?”
Seth(laughing) : “that my flower never described herself formally to me AFTER her date” Mehadi(smile&hug) : “Mrs. Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum.Happy now?” Seth(smile and gives Mehadi a Ring fetched from Cerulean while he was out to meet Professor Oak..) : “VERY” Mehadi(smile and wonder) : “Ah!Seth..this is..that’s what made you so return so late..” Seth(smiles and fits the ring into Mehadi’s Finger) : “ya,Talonflame you saw(finishes the fitting),Welcome to the Ketchum Family Ms. Mehadi Waterflower for the umpteenth time(smile)” Mehadi(smile,hug Seth) : “my pleasure once more” (both hug for a few moments) Mehadi(smile) : “how’s Cerulean?and which one?and actually you went there before you went to the Lab,right that’s why ‘don’t call anybody till I return’..hum?..” Seth(laugh) : “right.but before that Mehu I gave you this ring only after you confirmed that you’re my wife thus I was moral wasn’t I rhyming with Inkay(both burst into laughter)..you they they asked how the translators are going to help Gary said it will professionalize your personal life(both laugh a lot) and this is what it is you know no matter the highs of beatitude or despondency of magnitude you not be able to fall back to the dual ATTITUDE(laughs and hugs Mehadi very firmly,Mehadi laughs)..Cerulean is yet to come into terms with the fact that the young flower dream could stay depressed for more than 4 years and then suddenly a prince sorry a h.. b..(Mehadi frowns)..(laugh)..no Mehu,please otherwise I won’t be able to describe the best comedy I ever saw..(Mehadi sighs shakes her head and laughs)..so this brat comes and does his magic to get the flower to fly all by herself to him,I might’ve been killed today had it not been for Greninja,by luck I had her today.” Mehadi(concerned) : “they mobbed you in the shop?” Seth(laugh) : “thats exactly why I went there after the whole day of EMOTIONS(laughs a lot,Mehadi shakes her head still concerned)..I went to the Police Station(laughs a lot,Mehadi shakes her head laughing) straight away at 23:20,gave my identity if they didn't know my relationship status(both burst..),said I wanted a good amount of protection as if they knew(both un..) that too very quickly else if there’s a shoplifting in Mr Keller’s shop 3 blocks to the west,Waterpolo Crossing,red gem road,pearl house building 4th floor,right side 1st shop,then don’t sue me,to which the Officer warmly complied at 22:50 cause all knew what exactly is what(both laugh),shop at 00:10,but as usual the the people tried to mob me even at midnight as Cerulean doesn’t sleep(laugh) on the charge that I was the one indeed to break the heart of the youngest flower first then humiliated her in public second and then tried to kidnap her,forcing her to leave Cerulean for Elite 4 HQ at Indigo Platue,Kanto two days ago third-this as is doing the rounds in local Tvs,people demand answers,but the problem is before this news could spread upto here at my home,which if happened,they would’ve seen some great games with the whole Oak Lab Pokemons,the threat of which prevents a single one of them ever trying to break into Pallet as Gary himself is authorized to do that,anyhow the press had a bigger reason to not try to mingle with me,now that I had given them a bigger puzzle to solve by declining the Hall of Fame(bursts into laughter)No,please let me finish,this is the best piece of comedy I’ve seen or heard or readever.so they think now this new pest to the whole mass and especially Cerulean city being his target is a bit depressed,then our flower has indeed just trodden over this godforsaken brat once and for all and he’s defeated once and for all and depressed lost his mojo hence resigned..(bursts into laughter)..just bear with me Mehu..(laugh)..man what a trick that has been(laugh)..but then apocalypse approaches-suddenly that brat appears off the blue/in all smiles with his sinister dual crew/he gets to a shop as if to get his due/Ceruleans it’s ok that he declares a ring for his beau but then swiftly he adds please another for me too(bursts into more laughter,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears laughing,Greninja zaps in,then bursts into even more laughter)..” Mehadi(laughing) : “Seth,you’ve really become a public meance(Seth laughs even more),(laugh)Greninja stop that(Greninja tries to stand on one toe Finger on top of Mehadi’s head then she join Seth in fun)..Seth,then what happened” Seth(in tears from laughter,Greninja zaps out) : “oh..what a night,yeah right,I’m telling you please be patient,this is too funny” Mehadi(laugh) : “Seth..”
Seth(laughing) : “then to this their reaction was exactly this-what a night this compeers Cerulean/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon/Compeers let’s unite and challenge to this man/force him to show what he hides below his tan..(again laugh)oh! Man..Please,Mehu,you just need to be patient..”
Mehadi(bit concerned) : “I’m Seth,but you should stop being too reckless you see,and you only had 3 pokemons with you no matter what they can do you were in physical danger that they can’t help”
Seth(laugh) : “right I will be cautious later;now back to this,the officers try to tell them that he’s just here to buy a ring and go but a few young people weren’t going to listen so I had to release Greninja and tell them if they so wishes they bear witness to the ring I select and let us go outside and deal this matter like gentlemen,I challenge 50 people against Greninja all at once..that’s cause more the number more the illusion over my abilities and anyway thats 2 Ghostradarkarrigussonors a few Kirosblazinors and a Hydroquastorporus best with me together and each with infinitely more intelligence(laugh,Mehadi sighs and tenders Seth’s hairs)...and Mehu
they know about infinitely many circles around me with temporal time limit given according to my mental feelings and thus even if a handshakes crosses the limit with me being very
uncomfortable that’s good night as Giti was with me all time invisible as was Cozy as in that state they can stay for 10 to 12 hours(laugh) only police knew my GiraCozma’s presence I told them they are safe as well no matter what the possible mob does just get rid of the guns and all(laugh,Mehadi concerned tenders Seth’s hairs)..no Mehu Giti can go one level beyond Ghostradarkarrigussonor and Cozy two(laugh) and no you think they were tired after all they had to do today actually these serious works gets them bored so they become more incensed and hence if needed will become most jovial and thus only it never matters(laugh,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly with concern)..no,sweetie it’s ok,I was too excited I will be cautious later,hum,now my
sweet Mehu flower should beam at me..(Seth hugs Mehadi very firmly then both smile at each other)..right,anyway,Giti was invisible and surrounded me to gauge my mental states to calculate the circle breachs which were told to them to be a feet and then the adjustments this is 1 feet circle surrounding me they were taught these after that Unovan bratting ever took them in innumerable civil places(laugh,Mehadi keeps tendering Seth’s hairs and smiles)..then Giti was doing that to get rid of the daggers cause they were sudden and all then had UltraCozy(both laugh) as out layer and she provided a dragonic mask this is incredible cause I was in physical body totally sane and what those two were doing this is impossible below atleast Glytsohapmemrotusitel the 3rd psychic legend in strength list(laugh) and these were my protection and police was still there but anyway,now the bet is they win I won’t buy the ring if I do,they let me take the ring and facilitate me and my fiancee to a ceremony here and celebrate our engagement officially,to which a few said 50 on one,no matter who he is none can disrespect Cerulean like he has,some said no he has come up with a plan-he could electrocute the whole ocean at his leasure,some said he can move the whole police force at will and release Pewter and Yellowburst Forces too on us,some said why bother he has 235 dreaded demons himself making 234(laugh,Mehadi sighs and continues to tender Seth’s hairs) but in the meantime that was bought I placed the order(burst into lughater,Mehadi laughs as well),and they were confused cause they realized given my name and my brats may be my whole 137 psychics are present exactly there at that moment and yeah my Dialga can be present here right now that only I can detect and if he so wants Gary can detect but you will be in a year or so too(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and keeps tendering his hair),anyway,then realizing this they budged cause to them the invisibles were saying infact I should show you(laughs,sits straight on the couch,Mehadi laughs)-> 45+ still dears screech at us Villie filly (shocked,inquisitive)WHAT HAPPENED!(closed eyes flicks head and eyebrows and fingers quickly) stairs looked hilly hilly..(continues the rhyme physically same way)..(laugh,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits of laughter)/YAY!say Lillie chili HELP! So (shivering,creating sounds by teeth)..chilly!(shiverning more with smirk)..(pause)..chilly!..(continue physical actions without shiver with smirk flick fingers and head and eyebrows..)..(laughs,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits of laughter)/(impressed,fascinated,enticed face)..THAT'S THE CHAMP MAN!SAY Poppy Poppy..(astonished face) what is she doing..(apologetic face)..sorry unless close words i couldn't..(moving eyebrows up and down to make eyes broadened as to see more clearly,grave face as if imitating an owl,flicking fingers and head)..see being comfortable ah happy happy(laugh..lot,Mehadi un.. oy)/(happy face)HURRAY!(shocked face) WHAT!(making scared face)MOMMY!(more scared face,shrilling voice)COMING!(makes scary face with hands shaking his body in rhyme making his palms look like paws) Daisy agey..(continue physical action with chewing and moving his eyebrows in rhymes)..(laughs a lot,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter  oy)/AH!OUR DREAM!(as if suddenly shocked)MY GOD!JUST AT 44 no 1 to 2 Mehadi’s skin!(smirk,moving his body and two index fingers in rhyme as if hypnotizing slowly half closed dizzy eyes)..hazy hazy(doing same physical action bit quickly now also with eyebrows with the half closed eyes moving his head sideways) so so hazy..(continue physical action)..(laughs a lot,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs  oy in fits and convulsions of laughter and tears laughing)/so who we really are compeers EVOLVE Lati,Cozy,Zygie,Kurrie,Zeky(laugh,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs  oy in tears and fits of laughter)..so yeah this just came off(laughs a lot)..” Mehadi(fits of laughter) : “man,if they hear it all their dissent will be that much love for you and thus you’ll be absolutely chewed down by Villie Poppy Daisy Lillie at 44+ is just(imitating Seth’s scary face and all) agey agey(uncontrollably laughs,Seth too laughs a lot)” Seth(laugh) : “yeah that is what it is my non-psychophysical Mehadivious beauty(smiles at Mehadi and hugs her firmly then laughs,Mehadi smirks and hugs Seth firmly laughing)..well this actually came from my humms to myself Hoopa pa pa Ah ha ha ha(laugh,Mehadi laughs a lot  oy)..just wait till you meet the epitome(both laugh)..THE MEANING(both laugh a lot)..yeah had to be this one(both laugh a lot)..anyway,then I told them what is it that they have a problem with,calm down and lets talk.they said they suspect due to me,the famous gym is now closed and the Sensational Five all have left the city and they are not happy about it,to which I said what they want the Sisters or the performance which totally confused them and in the meantime I dealt with the shop..laugh..what a night this compeer Ceruleans..(laugh)..anyhow..now some said what are you trying to imply,some said this is public disrespect,some women said it’s gender bias,some reasoned heads said he has got a point,in the meantime I selected the ring(another burst of laughter)..oh!I’ll be barely able to forget this ever..” Mehadi(laughing) : “man I just imagine what’s gonna happen to my sisters once they hear these(both laugh)” Seth(laughing) : “so,anyhow they said they want the Gym to run again and the sisters to return,to which I said the Gym Leader was overworking and had the Frucifern gym attached as well,then just probably brunt out a bit,holidaying now to get over the exhaustion and I have only respect for her and nothing else and she wasn’t behaving properly as I was told so I just wanted to teach her a lesson and I just thought that would help to lighten her mood a bit and so on..then they said no you intentionally did it and you were the very cause of her depression and so on to which I just scoffed that they are disrespecting my fiancee for whom I’m buying a ring from their very own city itself..this got them dumbfounded and bought me more time for the shop..but then they tried to make a comeback saying I indeed was the one who abducted all the four sisters no matter what I say and may be my fiancee is from among them itself whom I’ve threatned to marry me or..laugh..may be I’ve threatened all of them to marry me..laugh..what a night this..anyhow..this was my exact trap,I just said they themselves will come to know whether it’s true or not if only they first even allow me to get ring otherwise I won’t be able to marry anyone let alone them and mostly if I don’t get married at all then none will come to know the truth anyway as both me and the sisters will only accuse each other and none will get the truth but if I’m getting married to my fiancee who isn’t from among them..laugh..(Mehadi and Seth both point to Mehadi’s ring and hug each other laughing)... now I accuse Ceruleans for mobbing up on me they will only harm themselves cause Elite 4 may cancel the Gym given that a local man like me who was from Pallet which is adjacent to Cerulean gets mobbed by almost hometown people..um,actually hometown(laugh,Mehadi smirks and tenders Seth).. and the Gym leader was not behaving well..and then they’ll come to themselves anyway as the Sisters would want to and have visit their home anyway,as they are still official gym leaders and even if there’s any procedure regarding the Gym,atleast one has to physically appear in sane state or send their confident..and besides even if they are right why would they want to buy a ring from their very own City where stars like them has bought from each ornament shop since childhood and moreover if I’m to appease them I could bring a ring from anywhere else or just could order it,why would I myself even step foot in Cerulean knowing people here would be incensed with me..so this long thought of thoughts(both bursts into laughter)..got them so confused,I finally put the ultimate knell in the coffin by saying that the reality is that the Sensational Sisters have their own lives and they must understand that no matter how electrifying darling of masses they were at the end of the day they have to settle down and have a nice family,and whether their very own home Citi’s beloved fans won’t consider them for even this bit..(laugh)..this sentimental attack totally deflated them and then I just continued to gibberish to which I said that it’s all normal and they just need to be calm and patient and the sisters has to visit their home sometimes they have to and they’ll be back soon,then they said why are you here,some said whom are you getting engaged to,and so on,to which I said,Cerulean is world famous for the diamonds and precious stones,where else would I go to except for here,to which they mellowed down a bit,but some said you could’ve still ordered it,to which I said would my fiancee be happy if I was afraid of the same people who adored me despite me humiliating their own Gym leader and clapped for my funny antics,they just fell down from heaven then but then they said alright now that you’re here show us a few tricks,to which I said if Cerulean formally invites me,I’ll be most grateful to come but tonight I’ve to go back with this ring to my fiancee and if they hold me up and delay that, Ceruleans will not be as appreciated as much their ring,to which they did mellow down finally and then they said alright but we won’t let you go without atleast a few tricks from Greninja,its pretty rare that a Cerulean has a Greninja as it’s only found naturally in Kalos and not even at Unova..rhymes ain’t it?(both bursts into laughter)...anyway,to which I had to oblige and Greninja showed a few balance tricks and all including the one she was trying to perform on your head,and then finally they were pleased but didn’t yet budge saying whom did you defeat for your second gym badge here,which they knew which I said it was Ms Daisy Waterflower(both laughs) and her Dewgong one on one I didn’t win she did within 5 minutes(both laugh) but she compassionately bestowed the badge upon me I was just starting though I had my Pikachu then but wasn’t any match to Dewgong still somehow he managed to satisfy her enough so she hand me the badge and I’m eternally greatfull to her for that cause till then I really wasn’t good enough but after this I got really straightened up as she also gave me some advises(both laugh) as I was a mere 17 year old then and I truly have remembered her as a big sister since then(both laugh)..indeed(all laugh) and that’s exactly why it felt bad when I heard the current Gym Leader’s condition so just helped but I knew a battle might’ve made her either more proud or more depressed I just resorted to have fun..this term of emotional discourse makes them to fondle me almost(both laugh) so I also got my ring and then they said I’ll have to promise them that I’ll return here and have a pokemon show or something or just your ideas those are even too funny(both laugh),to which I said as I would love to come but they must invite me formally via Kanto Elite 4 otherwise I will only be mobbed like I have been now and that won’t be helpful to anybody to which finally they budged and allowed me to leave properly,and then I went to Oak Lab at 12:00 and then Gary’s extended Lab side then back to Oak Lab and finally home only to see Mime is upto her dirty tricks with me(both laugh)..all thses cause AH!so Mehadivious!(laugh)..” Mehadi(smirk,lightly smacking Seth’s head) : “Mehadivious hum?..(Seth laughs  ehadi,laugh)Seth,quite a mess you’re creating now wherever you’re..going,and please don’t roam around unprotected like this..please,you’ve a family..” Seth( ehadi,smile) : “so sweet is my flower’s sweet touch..(Mehadi laughs and smacks a bit harder)..um,ok,ok,lightly(both laughs)..and I’m eternally Mehadivious(both giggle,Mehadi smirks and about to smack his head again)..ok,ok..no more..um perpetually lightly..(both laugh ach other firmly)..” Mehadi(laughing) : “Seth,they’ll eventually mob you for abducting me(both laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “I will say you’re lucky I didn’t marry her on that battle day itself(both laugh) I so much wanted to propose you then and there hence the gloves(laugh,Mehadi smirks and tenders Seth’s cheeks)..no Mehu,Cerulean is Cerulean to me ever a funny place,I wouldn’t have been able to come out of it so easily had I not had a water pokemon..so today’s heroine is indeed Greninja” Mehadi(laugh) : “after this mayhem you went to patch up with your family?” Seth(laugh) : “exactly”
Mehadi(laugh) : “and may I hear a bit from there,my sweet daring bee(Seth giggles,Mehadi smirks),I know the result but how did you calm them down?”
Seth(smile) : “Mehu,I’m in this Bash Cerulean..sorry(Mehadi laughs)..mood now,I’m dictating my movements back at the Lab comedy style,please bear with me.”
Mehadi(laugh) : “go on stand up”
Seth(laugh) : “so as soon as Daisy sees me..”you b..what were you insinuating(laugh,Mehadi shakes her head and then laughs),you’ve given my baby Mehu a bluff and threatened her to be with you and you even doubt you own bro Tracey..so on,so on,so on..to which I said look if you were ever suspecting Tracey,you’d want to see who far he can walk with you..which didn’t please our DaisyDaisyl(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..laugh..sorry..DaivyDesil at all(burst into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs)..DaisyDevil(both laugh even more)..man just wait till I get my hands on our sweetest eldest sis and her even sweeter dolls who are being looked after by ConHoopa(both laugh)..well that’s another saga I can’t finish 8 years at once you see(both laugh) so yesterday should’ve said Dase don’t try us(both laugh)..anyway,in the mean time the gentleman-looking-flying-fox(Mehadi bursts into laughter) came out to have a gauge only to eat a death glare from Daisy,so the poor thing wasn’t of much help,as usual out of bushes..(Mehadi again bursts into laughter)..then Daisy mellowed down but told me to go back home and ATLEAST,ATLEAST not to cheat on you the on the very first night,as if I cheated on someone with someone,whom I cheated to be with someone,who was infact the one whom I first cheated before I cheated someons..laugh..um,please Mehu,I’m sorry but I can’t help,blame Cerulean Mob for that..” Mehadi(laugh) : “I’m waiting to smack you again(both laugh)..” Seth(laughing) : “please(both laugh)..anyhow,next up Gary..man,you know as a former champion among bad boys I can’t believe you’d ever beat me(both laugh)..to which I said the same thing that I needed genuinity..which hopefully appeased the devil easier than big sis Daisyl(both laugh)..then Lillie..well its sad but I can’t help that it still had to be our Lillie flower to try me again(both laugh),she started with calling me a b.. but her disposition told me she is more concerned that her lion being professionally so may tonight give her the ditch(both laugh),so I didn’t say anything as I saw she was going all over sometimes wiping off her tears so that I could have a proper measurement as to how much she is weeping(both laugh,Mehadi shakes her head laughing),then still in the meantime tried to swell up her chheks more than necessary then understood it hindered her sobbing capasity hence desisted(both laugh),then finally understanding she won’t be able to cry for long proceeded to state that I had indeed opened the pandora’s box to use the emotional veil to fuel up more tears(both laugh),but as I said I know the exact contents as well,got kinda lost as to has she been caught(both laugh),but again came back that it still was opened and that too in front of everyone each of whom knew about that more than her as she was the source herself(both laugh),then as I couldn’t play any new hands she continuted her victory lap to declare her supreme realtion with you paused to insult me again for leaving you for roads.. s..,and brilliantly migrated to the next part by confessing her loging to Gary subtly hinting where I stood with you compared to Gary’s adoration to her,where my personality had fallen and where Dr Oak Dr Oak stood at present(both burst into laughter),as if the whole world never knew before(both laugh),in the meantime I gave the same logic and tried my best for the sake of her future which I have doubts of since I came to know it’s indeed she who is Gary’s wife(both laugh)..yeah came to know from professor just as I entered Kanto the names that is(both laugh)..thought to myself as if it was to be known(both laugh) anyway I have doubts over her future cause I’m not sure whose younger(both laugh),anyway I continued that logic with the fact that she was my sister-in-law to thinking that just let it be tomorrow and I cross you(both laugh) and all I fed her emotional tricks barely managed not to giggle as usual(both laugh) by taking these as a trick to come into terms with her relatively never absolutely(both laugh) so that she countered by saying I’ll still leave you,I should’t dare to nickname you for that matter(both laugh) and she’ll never be my relation as I said and so on and was pausing in the meantime to remember if anything else could thicken it more(both laugh),which I again countered by the old card of future but also rather firmly told her if I can’t nickname you I’ll mention you as my wife which off course our Delil flower didn’t Lil up to at all(Mehadi laughs) being Crabominable(Mehadi bursts into laughter) but had to submit to looking at my determination even in that position without much irritationhence managed somwhow to not ask me of flower bouquets(both laugh) anyhow these all finally tamed the lioness but still she pawed me finally by giving the marching orders reminding me once more how she’s much higher in majesty to allow me to distort her name in sentimental terms which I hapily obliged to save my life feeding her Gary lion’s name to her so that the devil finally calms down and almost smugs(both laugh) but somehow managed but all this was only to enter the lion’s mouth itself just outside the door who barked that his grandpa was waiting for his prey and I was to be sent there but he growled in such a sweet and polite way that you couldn’t help but agree(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..laugh..what a night this compeers Cerulean..laugh..won’t forget it through all hells,anyhow,this was round 2..” Mehadi(laugh) : “Seth, you’ve truly surpassed all expectations really.” Seth(smiling) : “all honoured coming from my all sweet Mehu flower(laughs,Mehadi smirks tendering him)..( ehadi)..who ever thought ‘Seth’ was too sweet to talk objectively sweet..laugh(Mehadi bursts into laughter  oy)..anyway 3rd round started and the old hen’s den who was rather easy to handle but beaked me by questioning my head off as to how I knew the secret truths and what are the levels of my and your special pokemons like Gyarados and Golduck and so on as if he is desperate for Team Rocket 2..laugh(Mehadi sighs and then laughs)..anyway this questioning was exactly the anticlimax of the early night Cerulean Fiasco,so it bored me to death,I somehow managed to lick his feet long enough to get out of there safely without having to transfer my pokemons this very night,which is why I had to be extra careful with the old bear..laugh..round 3 completes..” Mehadi(laugh) : “carry on,I’m sending your name to stand-up comedy before Pasios” Seth(laugh) : “you’ll save me from battling then too finally,thank you sweetie Mr Mehadi read it’s you not the beauty(tenders Mehadi’s cheeks,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..yeah they will just dissect our life with unimaginable vulgarity as you know and preach it to the whole world(both laugh)..anyhow round 4,now as I was coming out I thought TraleyDaivyl(Mehadi bursts into laughter) must be having fun now and I’m on my first night haven’t even been able to give the ring to my flower and this bonehead is in the Pasio of of Pasios since Pasios with his Daisyllish flovil and little brats too that too 2 in number Giti said yeah at a time to compensate for the lost years wicked you know(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..yeah the brats are spoiling them since they came into their mom’s womb(both laugh)..mentally that is(both laugh)..man I still will have to wait for tomorrow to fondle them today too much work at farm all absolutely unavoidable anyway,so their sweet cunning dad(both laugh) while pestering me since Pasios whenever I got alone with my sweet cherished Mehu flower,which made my blood absolutely boil to the 8th hell and I told Giti to fetch the Goddamn brat immediately,which he tickly complied by getting into the dubnut’s head and tickling him there with optimizable sequential momentary turns of continuous looks hallucinations..laugh(Mehadi bursts into laughter and shakes her head)..thus this gentleman looking most conniving fox that could get of all the Cerulean flower sisters the most ominus sinister(laughs,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears laughing) you too cause you made me always apprehensive that you may abduct me at any moment in 1st year Kanto(both laugh,Mehadi smirks and hugs Seth firmly laughing,Seth too hugs her firmly and both laugh) whom he got but waited till the last moment but as jackals do watching over the prey days and days only then to erect the ears just before jumping on the prey the jackal erected his ears finally after years and preyed upon Daisy finally getting her most depressed cause only to get that moment of landing the most ENDEARING(laugh,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of of laughter) no Mehu don’t become hysterical this is to jackals the most ethically moral given their ears are naturally pinpointed exactly to loony days(laughs,Mehadi laughs even more)...” Mehadi(fits of laughter) : “man Dase is not going to be alive when she hears this absolutely(both laugh)..the most ENGROSSING(both burst into laughter)..” Seth(laugh) : “no you know I want to babysit all or pester all except mom,Sabrina and Daisy cause I want to make limitless demands just my most dear sweetest eldest sis Daisy flower always(both laugh then Mehadi smiles and tenders Seth’s hairs,Seth too smiles) anyway then comes out Daisy’s jackal don’t get so happy you two Dr Tracey foxly sketchedit hum(laughs,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter and has convulsions from laughter,few moments later) so he didn’t know which side to jump to(both laugh) only managing to fire the “why drag all else” bullet which by now became so boring that I shot back a cannonball saying I needed to check our chemistry before I could join her in a parade,which he wickedly shielded saying they won’t be able to match my partner but they would follow behind,which puzzled me as I couldn’t instantly come up with an attack having to resort to embrace it out option,so the gentleman-looking-most-cunning-fox(Mehadi bursts into laughter) found out a way to make the honours even proving again why his name is so apt and skills so subtle that even engulfs Daisypedo(laugh,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter)..anyway(few moments later,laugh,Mehadi laughs a lot),then straight from devil’s den none other than our most honoured Daisy emerged who didn’t get the fact that a Tracey is only called so if the perception is properly amalgameted with perceptions hence become the most ENDURING(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter) so anyway to move forward(laugh,Mehadi laughs a lot) Daisy having followed her soulmate all the way as the wisdom nut I was ferrying around earlier,having bought it and now to apply it on me..and she broke the ground by declaring she had eavesdropped,which made me sigh even in that situation as if it was UNOWN to me(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter) but fortunately the wicked fox was utterly defeated much to my merriment,Daisy showed how compassionate she was by caring to call me not by my surname but hearing my name from Daisy the first time in my damned life was if not the straight road to heaven then I’m sure I’ll be doomed to hell.I realized the full trick as she had to oblige in front of my family and future card just like her younger lioness earlier and then took a wicked turn copied betterly from the book of her cunning soulmate by trying to create a little ripple effect in my calm emotional water surface by stating how devoted her little sis has been despite me being a f..
man-b..(Mehadi frowns) sorry again not at all not so(laugh,Mehadi sighs and laughs),and then as she basked in the glory of her impending victory,she bit me by implying I may again go back to any wh..any given day but may I atleast divorce properly and make her baby sis suffer less..I again just played my family and future card this time dragging Tracey right into this with me as I could see that wicked-gentleman standing there with a long face whole time thinking of the final attack that’ll finally sketch me down for good(both burst into laughter),anyhow Daisy didn’t think that the sentiment card can be handled for long so she launched her final attacked giving me the marching orders specifically mentioning to go back only to home with the details of the rout and not to any waiting b..,which I would’ve had she not mentioned that and especially the route..laugh..what a night..I need a moment”
Mehadi(laugh) : “and you had our engagement ring in your pocket?” Seth(smiling,tendering Mehadi’s cheeks) : “the cover of the box was SMOOTHENING(both uncontrollably laugh)...man what pests we have in our bunches mentally that is(both laugh a lot)..anyway,she also tried to drag Tracey to return with her as she suspected I was indeed a terrible influence over her cherished gentleman as she saw Trace throughout was rather ungentlemanly naïve(Mehadi laughs and keeps tendering Seth’s hairs,Seth laughs),anyhow the wicked-gentleman all along thought of a plan and finally sold me the sketch card that he promised in earlier which I had to retort with a solemn concern that he needs to extend my contract here at the Lab,which he also bypassed by joking about my grand future(both smile and then laugh) and cunningly showing that how gentleman like I should be in that regard which is the true testament why the sly-buffoon indeed was the soulmate of DaisyDevil..laugh(Mehadi laughs)..sorry..anyhow,the dumb-looking-ever-conniving-jackal(Mehadi laughs) yet came back saying I should call from Brock to God himself as Viol herself to Brock again to the path of God(laugh,Mehadi burst into laughter) by myself to plead mercy for my terribly unbearable sins which I just about sidestepped by saying it’s too late at night and then finally as I was coming back I couldn’t help but to again set Giti on Trace and snatch his phone away by creating illusions long enough for me to search up Brock and send a text that “just urine and stool in a way circulates the body-use today and throw tomorrow natural process ain’t it sweet sweet Brocko but you aren’t going to the washroom next time just because the previous was satisfactory enough are you(laugh) did you ever feel Brock that you thought your washroom was old after using another at your office or so many times if in need(laugh) necessity is all ain’t it,so thank me and yeah thanks.Tracey Skechum,Seth’s Husband”(laughs,Mehadi sighs) and then deleted the copy and No don’t get so surprized I’m coming in terms with it..let the devils wake up tomorrow and massacre among themselves over me,I told them I’ll myself leave their baby sis if they want legal procedure but the problem as soon as I leave you,they know what happens as I myself handed them you prescription..No Mehu,it was needed..the bufoons must know that the personal life they so cherish also applies to their baby sis no matter who she becomes,why would I take all the blame myself when my sweetie herself always asked me to continue and finish my journey first then she comes and my sweet flower was cheated on her sweetness..( ehadi very firmly)..”
Mehadi( oy firmly) : “Seth,please,don’t get so excited all the time sweetie,they’re our family,no need to be so harsh..and no no legal procedure will take place..and I’m only happy that you told them about my plight cause I didn’t tell them myself and had to..it’s ok dear..just stay with me and I’ll handle them and no they won’t insult me for you..please..”
Seth(whinning) : “then also they should let me some peace and quite with MY WIFE in PINKEN ISLANDS FOR TWO WHOLE DAMN WEEKS..unless they agree my bunch will force more joviality upon them..those..”
Mehadi(sigh) : “Seth,you’re not at all mentally well..” Seth(frown) : “ ‘course I’m not,Mehu ofcourse I’m not-I see my Gengy and Sablie and can’t be them due to f.. b..(Mehadi sighs) and yeah it’s ok I couldn’t cause I never had you then but(grim) even none is letting me to solve the problem why so much interest in my private life huh as if they want to picture if..” Mehadi(scowl and frown,stern voice) : “Seth!stop it!we can’t live alone and enjoy and let our family suffer like this..” Seth(grim) : “Mehu,please,I beg of of you,please.I NEED YOU alone with me for atleast a week at a secluded place as soon as possible,else it will be hard for me to not go to the next step to share my happiness and hence I won’t be returning here sanely” Mehadi(tendering Seth,bit shivering voice) : “which won’t happen as long as your wife is here IN ANY FORM(both hug each other very firmly for a few more moments..then later) dear,I understand your condition and pain,let me handle the relatives and friends from tomorrow ok?” Seth(smile) : “of course,but I don’t want my wife to be insulted due to me,if any clown try to get their dirty hands at..” Mehadi( oy,deep breath) : “Seth!enough is enough,let them go and don’t create any more fuss,I’ll go alone tomorrow..” Seth( ehadi) : “and they’ll insult you on your choice the first day because some f.. b.. couldn’t care to come back from Unova to his dear..(Mehadi tries to stop Seth)..No let me finish,please(Mehadi sighs deep breath),I need to vent it out,and some other f.. thought it’s so easy for Seth Ketchum to become the Prince of Kalos and get his face dirty by an eternal s.. who cheated on our friendship that she feigned for 2 years and now’s my beau made of stool and pus and I have to lick and smell that cough and urine in public and..” Mehadi(stern) : “Seth! Your with you wife..for God’s sake...” Seth(still whinning) : “yeah,to be which took me so long cause I was a godforsaken b.. but it would’ve been easier for me if I wasn’t entirely forsaken by people back at home here except Gary,so I’m a playboy,I get insulted on the way while carrying the engagement ring that I’ll give a ring and then leave my wife and enjoy some wh..” Mehadi(shivering voice, oy) : “you’ll make me cry again,you want that so badly don’t you again and again?” Seth( ehadi) : “um..sorry Mehu..physical limitation you know that you have today sorry honey..” Mehadi( oy very firmly) : “Seth,I understand the pain you went through and your self denial didn’t help it either no matter you admit it or not you know it..I did call Brock myself and told him of our impending engagement..” Seth(scoff) : “and he had some Choiced words indeed I guess..” Mehadi(sigh) : “whatever,you know who he is and why he is so important to both of us along with everyone else yes Trucie,Irie,Yumi and Oliv too I told..” Seth(frown) : “well they will behave better than than these m.. as would anyone else including Kane and Vigil for sure and now Tony might be a bit upset that’s all still all will not atleast behave like infatuated c..(Mehadi sighs)..yeah,sure for a d.. nah my language hasn’t been cultured for sure today(laughs sarcastically)” Mehadi(smile) : “that’s my sweet ‘lil bee,now come here(opening her arms)” Seth( ehadi very firmly,solemn) : “you’re not going anywhere tomorrow morning except for Lillie,Gary is not an infatuated fool like the other two mu.. and he’ll take care of dumb stunts himself..” Mehadi(tendering Seth) : “Seth,please,I’ll go to all the places,and manage it,No,they can’t think and say whatever they want about my husband either,I’ll announce my engagement to the press myself” Seth( ehadi firmly) : “but make sure they don’t disturb us at my home or at the Lab,Pallet has many open places,they can mob me all they what there,but if they have one word to say about you or mob you or try to get us at my home or Lab or you,and most importantly if Mehu is in direct physical danger,I’ll empty all my pokemons on them and won’t take any responsibility for any kind of repercussions which is just that they will wake up next week only after getting through the life of a week in detective tickling..(both uncontrollably laugh)..(few minutes later,Seth’s phone rings)..here here,sure the g.. dumbnut is o.. with excess..(Mehadi scowls and scoffs at him)..anyway..” [phonecall]
Tracey(concerned) : “Seth..”
Seth(stern) : “Trace,please I beg of you you’re a dad get you g..”(Mehadi snatches the phone away) Mehadi(frown) : “enough Seth,let me handle(keeps Seth away)” Seth(self) : “these f.. tools..nah! I’m only jeopardizing my time with Mehu” Mehadi(solemn) : “Trace,I know what he did,what are you so upset about?Seth isn’t exactly in a good mental state ok,you know about the bunch more than anyone and I’m confirming you the person,he deserves to be alone at least on his first night with his wife when he already has done what he could,just leave him alone” Tracey(concerned) : “Mehadi,I understand he’s stressed but I’m suggesting that you handle the relations and keep him away from people in general as well ok?” Mehadi(sigh) : “yeah Trace,thanks and that’s exactly what I’m doing,did Brock ring you back?” Seth(frown) : “f.. m.. w..”
Mehadi(frown) : “Seth I’m talking.go to bed(Seth sits down looking at Greninja’s pokeball which is empty Greninja is outside somehwere else with Sableye and Gengar and Pikachu) and stop thinking what you’re.”
Tracey(sigh) : “Yes,he called and he was the representative against the lab today outside whole world besieged us I had my disagreements but none of the accusations they stamped on the lab were true this much I still could discern exactly what I had to do at Platue Lance himself inquired me for long with others but this is unlike Brock cause that farm was a set up to divert attention and there he volunteered to prove Blithie wrong and you know the result hence himself isn’t in the best of moods cause this isn’t his nature at all and hence has his doubts over Seth’s intentions all the more now which I only confirmed him to be as good as possible for an honest and self dignified man as he ever is but my trouble is that he may go further”
Mehadi(concerned) : “yeah,I’m calling him immediately,will that be ok?” Tracey(solemn) : “I don’t think it’s a trouble,with Seth on fire today already has been too eventful..but I think it’s better if Seth himself talks that’s his trouble he lost all his faith from upon him..” Mehadi(frown) : “ok just hold on for a minute ok?Seth,take my phone ring Brock while I’m talking with Trace,Please do as I say,and be polite he has Viol with him,now go ahead please,yeah Trace..” Seth(trying to find Brock,self) : “the f.. w..”
Brock(concerned) : “Mehadi..”
Seth(laugh) : “aren’t you already dumped?(bursts into laughter)” Brock(sternly) : “..Seth...” Seth(laugh) : “Mr Ketchum..first,I’ve killed Mehadi second,using her phone to fool you,third I’ve s.. her dead..” Brock(very angry) : “Seth,you’ve crossed all limits,who do you think you’ve..” Seth(laugh) : “Playboy..don’t you know that honey..” Brock(very agitated,stern) : “Seth,don’t get me started ok,you know very well what antics you pulled on that day and today too as I heard and that day what you were saying about..” Seth(solemn) : “Mehadi..the emblamatic Cerulean w.. yeah right you heard that w.. yeah again has nothing to do with my wife yeah you heard right..my wife Mehadi has nothing to do with that s.. Mehadi..yeah you heard right again and yeah about you and the rest that were at the spot,yeah I know the aftermath too yeah,I realize for both our cases actually,what sort of a d.. b.. would want to smell the cough of a w.. when you had your soulmate..,anyway,well I can be frank to you,but if Violet is around..” Violet(scream) : “you b.. you’ve abducted my baby sis and you f.. p.. you’re threatening my Brock now you s..” Seth(solemn) : “well um..(laugh)..I’m sorry Violet that you’re a d.. fool but you won’t recognize your baby sis anymore though and also wouldn’t have in case of your beau too had he been..(bursts into laughter)...” Violet(crying) : “you p.. (uncontrollably cries,scream)..”(Brock Controls her) Brock(sigh) : “Seth,I understand your actions with me the logic not it’s excecution..no you know Viol as well especially now had to that is her medicine to stay numb for herself cause her baby sis is still under the rule of law..and for me I’ve always had understood your logic that day behind your actions regarding me since that day itself but not what are you upto yourself cause my problem has always been your views that you just again conveyed to me like that day cause for once I know you can’t live in duality” Seth(bursts into laughter) : “indeed I can’t hence hovering around from one to another for cough and spit or what like the taste of old urine of 18 years 5 years later now 23(uncontrollably laughs)..” Brock(stern) : “Seth,Enough I get it but the thing is that no matter how much Mehadi may cherish you,we’re her family and we atleast have the right to know whether her fiancee atleast have the minimum courtesy to speak properly with us or not..” Seth(solemn) : “HUSBAND not fiancee never was never will across time and you should’ve known it for exactly that long if none else I’ve never imagined myself to be anything but her husband since the day I understood she isn’t anything but my wife and it took 7 days at the forest for me in reality for her less than 4 minutes the rest part you again know was only to confirm the psychophysical existence..anyway,Brock,I can’t cherish my wife right?” Brock(solemn) : “that’s past according to your very own language once more you’re not helping any you understand with the duality let me be clear I understand your decision to not start a family but not to marry her before Unova and that exactly is the duality that you thought then you won’t be able to in-your-words restrain which baffled me there that exact word no matter your sentiments that you won’t get out of unless you can think properly which I doubted then and now it’s a whole new dimension given your bunch and public antics..” Seth(laugh) : “duality?just two things Brock,I guess we can continue this call for a pretty long time and you won’t mind if I tell you to not do it in front of Violet cause she’ll get too emotional too easily and so will my language thus,are you with me on these two?” Brock(solemn) : “yeah,just hold on a bit then..”
Seth(solemn) : “just a sec make Violet hear this..right,the things that Daisy might’ve told you Violet were not in absencse of Brock himself..Brock it’s those two days during Pasio break if you care to recall..he will tell you later Violet after he finishes with me once and for all and yeah just for your clarification may be it’s not true that Yveltal says those rather the translator but you see that won’t become wrong no matter he or his master that’s all and to add to it don’t jeopardize yourself like Daisy was trying her hands at too desperately Mehu will live on and you infer the rest of my implication including the fact that Daisy doesn’t listen to anyone you’ll know best hence atleast you keep off from hospitals..right take rest now so Brock we may continue if you agree..” Brock(solemn) : “yeah I do but give me the time to arrange..” Seth(smile) : “most gladly”
..........
(Mehadi and Daisy)
Daisy(solemn) : “it’s me..”
Mehadi(scowl) : “Dase are you out of mind huh..”
Daisy(solemn) : “have to..”
Mehadi(sternly) : “listen I myself wasn’t in the right mental state and you must’ve seen the prescriptions ok..
Daisy(solemn) : “just that and no more Mehu why is it lingering on the charges..” Mehadi(solemn) : “his mental state isn’t alright at all and you’ve seen all of it yourself and the bunch is just waiting for this cause neither are they happy ever you know what I mean this is strange but this happiness of his isn’t going to allow him to be with his wife unless you all help and he is just being too overprotective of me now,he wants to make up all his 23 years infact at one moment that he was away from me and had me without the theory that’s all..and with you he can’t keep it to himself that how could you not believe him seeing his bunch first hand..” Daisy(solemn) : “no Mehu the bunch we know it’s ok I get that bit and our mistrust stems from his own antics only cause the signatures would’ve required 3 days no more..and hence only he’s not helping himself at all for 8 long years now and yes I understand his happiness and the repercussions and fervently hope he is alright but for me the one glaring thing is just that I atleast am still not clear of his intentions as simply due his own behaviour with Trace,just totally opposite at every moment and totally confusing..Mehu this isn’t pokemon plane one must..” Mehadi(sigh) : “Dase,please,with all due respect you know about his bunch more than him but you don’t know upto what level he is attuned to them I saw that for 7 hours today,it’s not easy for him what is for us and viseversa..you understand Stashey’s nature of duality this is same Seth always had his grips over it but that was most reluctantly only I was there hence all these once he knows what he wanted to that’s now he won’t have that grip anymore cause he’s done with his uncertainty over physical plane and that’s all me as well..he wants me dually in a non-dual plane whatever he means by it the same relation he has with his pokemons but in their case he does this only to enjoy the reverse phase which you understand isn’t possible in my case cause of bigger intricacies of existential views..his trouble was exactly that never knew how to validate me as he himself yet admit that he wanted me to remain dual hence all those words of mental planes..that is his way of duality and he isn’t going to eschew that no matter what hence is prepared to go to any hells with it exactly like Stashey but his ideas are against duality itself he doesn’t want to do anything with it but Seth wants that to synchronize with reality hence only me and hence only all this..now that’s for the background in the gross and your questions on intentions,Seth has atleast got rid of my depression no matter how and I know more than anybody that none else in the world could’ve done that..” Daisy(solemn) : “but Mehu,I understand you still I mean this is very strange that’s all and yeah Trace has told me about Chansbert,I just want my baby Mehu back to her self that’s all...” Mehadi(sigh) : “Dase,the self you’re talking about has always been Seth for me when I didn’t meet him psychophysically even and you’ve now seen it yourself..you know now to upto where I went just to be that self without that particular cause and how abjectly I’ve failed..Dase please I don’t need to explain your and Trace’s relationship but are you so entangled with affection that you can’t use your head..” Daisy(solemn) : “affection isn’t the only issue Mehu the gross is the issue too look I know upto which I can push myself in psychic channels and where I can’t cause I don’t want it and nothing else they have no such concerns hence I’m afraid of the threshold and nothing else..and no Mehu,that I know for sure how much and what he means to you but I’m just afraid of the fact that even if all the allegations against him is totally bluff,his antics with us of all doesn’t give a picture of a stable man who can look after someone as in a family and this has been my suspicion forever and that’s the threshold that I find no logic to go over it if I were them..at least you may take your time..” Mehadi(firmly) : “Dase,please you know his memories of his dad he never wants that only that nothing else and then he didn’t want that to happen to me no matter what it may seem to us or the logic be behind it..and you know surely now he had to leave abruptly for Sinnoh as well I’ve seen almost the whole bunch today for 7 hours..you know what gross powers they pocess too..it was necessary then which he couldn’t clearly state then..and about his ability to look after his family,Dase,you tell me,a lunatic infatuated man won’t take 7 hours constant from 8:15 to 15:15 to date me first within that time and we had huge quarrels where his language was way worse than what he used today morning and still forced me to take enough food twice third within that time my dosage of () wasn’t taken about which he knew too well and during the break-in collected all infoes regarding those and kept basic medicines and forced me to take that dosage in less amount and those medicines so that I can go on which means he didn’t want to let me go today no matter how long it took and inside he was totally lunatic in his yearning for me couldn’t wait for another day and date in fear of losing me but in the truest sense of that word third would never be so concerned about me that he would take me to the best doctors in the world immediately after proposal and you saw Hunnie was there too who doesn’t work there hence you can understand why she was there and no both Edu and Neil were there at the lab itself with the rest of the staffs you never met them our family made sure of it..you also know where Marengo is and what it takes to go there that quickly and then set things up there so much that none asked one thing of him or me and you know whole Marengo knows me very well for the show alone and only the main doctors discretely spoke with me in both his and Hunnie’s presence and she was there to validate him and translate him is gross and hence we rather had a consultancy session on medicines and you’ve seen behind that prescription the best doctors of all regions are mentioned there yeah even in the hard copies were done from the sources itself with with first hand signatures and seals and this is again cause of validation and because all these doctors were busy he spent () to invite other doctors from even other regions if free to consult or those who are just retired to have a day and he paid that sum to ensure everything is run smooth for only making 5 persons unavailable and this Elzie herself can confirm you then lastly and most important he disclosed to my own family the full prescription so that my treatment may not be hampered and my family gets to know all about my plight for future considerations no matter what he does with me and you know it’s not what you think it’s the so and so who might’ve started a new Team Rocket at Unova with all those rare legends is what bugs him and he told the doctors as well who treated him before and after his undercover and Sabrina recommended him to them along with Neil and Hunnie and already within this little time has told me he might be needed at Unova and undercover though he will try not to but situation may arise cause Stashey alone can’t manage an undercover and you know they won’t be separated no matter what hence only despite both bro and Stashey telling him not to go went to undercover first time and this time will do it all the more happily and this all shows still when it’s about pokemons ready to sacrifice me no matter how much he cherishes me all cause none else can help them at Unova and having all those badges he feels a moral responsibility as a few leaders there were light unto him in his dark days there...and yeah lastly in those 7 hours simultaneously he showed me his level of attunement with his bunch..his whole life ideology has been projected upon them hence he is integral with them and the reverse psychic force means he behaves like them with human beings too now being too everhappy as it seems to us and to him as well but the reality is not that cause that only veiled his pain he had that I didn’t trust him despite having all chances to see his bunch and all and that’s the only unreal part of the reality hence not fully real..no I don’t defend him he knows what mistakes he committed but he has done more than enough to make both our sides illusory to us that just no more exists between us and you can be assured of it grossly too cause not a so and so can get me out of Chansbert’s grips and it’s all because he himself is too familiar with all these..anyway enough,doesn’t all this answer your responsibility question?” Daisy(concerned) : “Mehu,I understand all,but you’ve always been..” Mehadi(shivering voice) : “and still after all these he hasn’t right and thus you first will kill Trace if not yourself and second will push my husband towards..(Daisy sighs,”Mehu..”,firmly)..anyway,you also must know you’re right you know what,he’s going to tell the same thing to Brock why don’t you two just connect to him,I’m telling you..and you too Trace,just clear up the confusion that what you saw first time 20 years back wasn’t a bluff...just call him and listen to what he has to say,I’ll be there as well..” Daisy(bit concerned) : “Mehu..”
..............................................................................................(all connects to Seth and the Mehadi also joins)...........................
Seth(laugh) : “Holy company,23 long years in making,so finally Brock all friends to all family and finally reunion ain’t it but never family since start(laugh)?”
Daisy(stern) : “Ketchum,you won’t have any of it if you miss this one no matter what Mehu may do or think..”
Seth(smile) : “sure,Ketchum is trying his best,but please bear with me and keep patience,this language is necessary for reasons you only can understand if you’re patient as ever,please,I beg of you,please,listen patiently I don’t have my bunch to hold you off now so please again let me say what I want in a language that’s most important far more than the contents that they are trying to convene without which I can’t clear up your confusion regarding whatever you will ask me henceforth now so just listen patiently..so here you see for you all there is this glaring,vivid,clear,distinctive thing exists which is THIS IDEA which never changed in 23 years so I don’t expect it to change in this conversation span and given the last 5 years but anyway,only for my wife’s sake I’m doing it and please allow me to express in clear terms my and Mehu’s relationship now..so you see this beloved idea of your’s that Seth Ketchum was ever infatuated with Mehadi Waterflower no matter how much she truly cherished him and infact was JEALOUS of her due to his SELFISH desire of erasing everyone off from his career to whom he or his twin lost and for the fact that he could use different veils to have a dual life and so on and thus he has always USED her to FEED himself and now that finally it’s been in public gospel that this statement that Seth Ketchum has been found in every bed with every imaginable so and so is indeed a true statement,it perfectly validates your concern and suspicion that truly Seth Ketchum never cared beyond infatuation about Mehadi Waterflower for 18 long years no matter what she did or took him
to be so by virtue of that Seth Ketchum will still hold the same view on Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum,who is his wife now..in one word Brock,Daisy,Trace..Mehu was and still is a random so and so to me ever no matter of her views of me and my view hasn’t changed in 23 years no matter what,this I have to contradict isn’t it Brock?whether I cherish my wife or not on my first night after marriage just this convulsion of ending youth?(laughs a lot)”
Brock(solemn) : “you wouldn’t have to if you had the minimum idea of how not to make enemies out of your friends”
Seth(frown) : “friends?why is it so Brock,that I’ve always found that I received more sympathy from my female friends than my male counterparts during my separation to my utter surprize and disdain?
Brock(solemn) : “well,you never were harsh to them for certain reasons,simple.” (Seth bursts into laughter but Mehadi covers his mouth) Mehadi( oy,sternly) : “none moves out of here and none retorts,whoever wants may politely continue and my husband will not give any proof to anyone regarding his alleged private life except his wife and he has already more than done that,if you still want you may continue and Seth,either you’ll be polite or it won’t be good for you” Seth( ehadi quickly then letting her go) : “right Mehu,right.so Brock(laugh)..I’m sure you’ve heard what happened to a few female in-quotes friends of mine whereas my behaviour to them has never been that of a friend no matter their current relations with me a lot of such examples you know yourself and yet when some of them got up to my nerves and I’m sure you’ll comply if I don’t take advises from people on my personal life with my then-girlfriend-now-wife Mehu if I don’t agree with them and clearly showing them that I don’t like their approaches to me despite them not desisting due to whatever,and no the them means only one of whom you know very well by know rest were never in illusion no matter their outside hence only they were able to stick along and has..none of them including the one that was in illusion still can say they ever in their most minute scrutiny from any mental state has ever found that I was psychophysical to them in our transactions and they won’t Brock that I can assure you as much as you can hence you know as much as do I what we’re talking about and Daisy this is for your logical snooker..so I’m expecting answers here from both Daisy first” Daisy(frown) : “I understand you Ketchum the problem is none plays or tries to get out of it while amongst the whole world interactively..” Seth(laugh) : “yeah sure(Daisy extremely angry,tries to say something Tracey controls her)..anyway Brock,about the play that both of you are implying what would be the trouble if it’s played in the public interactively I ask you cause you’ve seen me doing it” Brock(solemn) : “that was then Seth both of us know the best of our traveling days and that’s what Daisy has been suspicious of since the beginning about you that you could but now can’t Seth live in duality just that..anyway,about your compliance,on the first account of your behaviour to your female friends yes and also you would then see that there’s no gender bias there once similarity applies in behaviour and on the second account yes only if your ‘not desisting due to whatever’ is something that you can elaborate now via your answers to the central question here,so I’m expecting continuity here.” Seth(smile) : “right,as I was saying,that’s great and I’m sorry if I was rude or is..but Brock you want to know why I did what I did after my separation or do you want to know whether I cherish my wife as much as she does or not or do you fevantly want to know whether I’m implying that my then-girlfriend’s presence to you was more important than her relationship with me so that I was taken as a support to the main centre and then as the support to the main centre wasn’t supporting so the endeavour to fix this up..which question is bugging you the most Brock cause your duality can have a multifaceted answer..” Daisy(sternly) : “Ketchum,what are you trying to imply on the third even today in front of Mehu?” Seth(solemn) : “that I don’t care a fig if my girlfriend is happy or not due to my activities if I know I’m honest to myself cause then my girlfriend truly hasn’t known my soul DESPITE 15 years and THUS she has no place for me no matter what.JUST THAT.” Daisy(sternly,extremely angry) : “you’re still saying it even now?” Seth(solemn) : “yes and this is the first thing I told Mehu last noon and this I’ll keep saying till my last breath that I didn’t care what was happening to her THEN cause otherwise it would’nt have been 5 seconds what to speak of 5 years.I had my different problems cause as I told you before I didn’t THEN know my relationship PERFECTLY with Mehu as I DO NOW and hence the result.” Daisy(solemn) : “so basically then in your perception your wife would now take the place of your girlfriend?” Seth(smile) : “exactly where you’re all wrong because what my girlfriend then didn’t know about me now she is my wife only because she most perfectly knows now and thus the trouble isn’t plausible simply because I wanted to s.. her then now that’s no more present in my mind(laughs a lot,Daisy and Brock extremely angry)..” Mehadi(sternly) : “Seth I be polite I’m telling you last time don’t isult me..and yeah for you why I also didn’t care about my then boyfriend cause he didn’t know my soul either but now both of us more than know it and thus we’re married.” Brock(solemn) : “so Seth,this only proves once more your subsequent resentment with us when your patience according to you broke down but what exactly is presence?” Seth(straight face) : “I’m coming to that a bit later Brock cause Daisy what you mean by caring for your spouse is the thing that you do yourself as does your spouse when you two handle what you handle stay where you stay sometimes due to your professions..the same reason why so many true couples of different genders being travel companions volunteers themselves in so many risky situations..I’m assured of the same conviction that all you have nothing else the language as I was saying is to only get to this conclusion from a point of view of being besieged by the duality of emotions and this is exactly your logical snooker in public..(laugh)..I like this term..” Daisy(shout) : “KETCHUM YOU..(Tracey controls her)..” Tracey(angry) : “Seth enough with your insinuations either you politely continue or I’ll have to cut off..” Seth(laugh) : “yeah surely being the master of that game..(laugh)..and this I again say cause my efforts will be futile unless your wife clears her head up from her bias first (very sternly)..HENCE MAKE HER BEHAVE..” Brock(grave) : “Seth you continue what you were saying on presence Trace can ask the questions that..” Daisy(angry) : “no need Brock I’m alright today I’ll see where he leads me finally..” Seth(broad smile) : “right,anyway Brock about your presence,well,all I meant is if people stay all the time and people stay not any time then surely there’s an idea that people who stays all the time is more well known thus more well understood subsequently more well trusted consequently more well comprehended and finally more well present to all the observers.” Daisy(angry) : “that means Ketchum you still don’t agree that you should’ve returned from Unova atleast once before the finish for atleast one damn weekend and not act like an egotistical so and so.” Seth(solemn) : “no cause my bunch needed me more than anyone including Mehu each smallest unit of time so one damn second was infinitely too much Daisy weekend was a long way off not for nothing did I do all those cups there and was doing since Johto itself the contests and so much variety in my career hence no I couldn’t by any means and yeah I would I like to elaborate to you Daisy especially that tomorrow the result will be same with two differences and that’s despite my current position and mental state of better wisdom that first and foremost,I will not whine like a coward to her that I’ll return after this number of years but rather will directly chide her out of her illusion sternly that was my problem I understood then itself I needed to forcefully drag my wife out of gym for a week that none of you could cause you couldn’t validate your reasoning given her character..and no the rest that I was doing as you all know that is to tell her each and everyday that my bunch and me myself are pushing myself and them to a position that requires me to forget every personal bond cause it appears as a weakness to me which never is the case with my wife hence she needs to be strongest at this juncture and then second the way to test my commitment independent of my words is to check what my bunch is doing day by day and how they are improving by moments and what they actually want and question me on that I’ll not tire to talk about that but this requires my wife first to be present with me for a week the whole world couldn’t take the charge except Gary but I could and could let people take it seamlessly as I did with my travel companions there and hence my wife would’ve been the easiest to help no matter he profession but the second requirement is that my wife’s surroundings has to understand that no matter her character she still needs to be governed well cause the place where she was staying isn’t exactly favourable to her due to her career outside this profession which was only too vividly clear to her elder sisters cause they faced the same thing each day and bled inside as much as she did..and(milder voice),Daisy I perfectly understand your position and view but Trace knows best what my bunch was doing then and you yourself are a first nomination worthy gym leader officially that’s the implication and have been seeing them for more than a year now day in day out they needed me,I needed them,my desire,goal and ambition as I call it from textbooks sheding the being off to self was about to get into a road that was most enjoyable and effective to me and them hence neither side could budge cause we just forgot everything else and hence my and their erratic behaviours cause we wanted to cut everything off that hindered us reminding us of our little being which we so desperately wanted to shake off for good and they have succeeded in doing so I’ve not and the reason is that my wife wasn’t there with me without whom I’m not full at all and the viseversa is why she was in so much plight she needs me and I need her and hence still after all these years we’re again back in all glories and this time without even scant doubt about our relationship but at Unova it wasn’t the case and my bunch was going nuts to get to their goal and they forced me to be there all time else public would’ve been harmed may be you know the story of Glalie she would’ve destroyed your whole gym alone cause that was her impending level and none could stop them from that except me or his master and thus I was concerned and then their condition was also mine my biggest mistake that I’ve so much regret for isn’t coming back or contacting it’s just that whenever I spoke with Mehu I couldn’t let go of my ego of being honest to my bunch so much that I took her life for granted and none except me knew what my bunch was doing none could cause I wasn’t cleared myself and hour after hour those realizations kept pouring upon me I got lost in that with my ego swelling even more as soon as I grabbed one realization but the very next decimated me and so I wasn’t well at all but Mehu was my resting place ever is and has been and I just didn’t pay any attention to this fact that no matter what I can’t set fire at my own living room myself and if fire is there I should jump in to extinguish it rather than trying to blow it away,Mehu had troubles serious troubles cause she was working so much and that she still would cause her nature is such but then what I didn’t was to force her to spit out what her trouble was which I realized cause she wasn’t willing to talk about professional matters with me then when I needed it and whole world knows what our attitude has been to each other since 17 and half,day one and thus yeah I didn’t get my wife beside me then but the reason was that she wanted her husband with her then which first didn’t happen due to my bunch second he wasn’t man enough to tell her that I know you have troubles tell me about them I’ll make sure what I can do either else I’ll play this via press which will make sure either you come here at Unova and we jointly declare our relationship and I can ever get the ring you want right in front of them in a week all these can be done no matter my bunch’s requirement of my presence cause they always have been at the press as you know..you all couldn’t get her out of gym cause in all your minds in the subconscious it was my mistake that Mehu wasn’t doing anything wrong by just wanting to have her husband talk for a minute with her as her emotional closure the problem for me is that neither could any of have apprized me of it cause my mistake was independent of Mehu’s that was this exact that she didn’t need the emotional closure she had long surpassed that need cause we’ve been married for 15 years been through many things ourselves we didn’t need that stuff ring or no ring..and the reason was that you were facing similar dilemas in your own lives certainly all of you were Daisy except one and the reason is cause of the reality that to your soulmate existential logic don’t ever apply..but the exception I’ll talk about later,anyway as I said my behaviour to my wife being that of her husband was something that was never done from me cause of my illusion that I was honest enough to myself hence the world may go to hell and thus neither she nor me were happy cause as you can see ever both of us intuitively knew that except each other there’s no life for us and no I’ve never been happy being at all beds as said else I wouldn’t have returned given Mehu’s condition for sure if that is what I really wanted especially after 5 years of no contact..Mehu has been my wife since I know herself as well itself but I never knew properly that it really means it and not a random sampling surely we all know cases of 30 year relationship breaking down cause it was just random sampling Mehu and me isn’t that at all but then I had this illusion that we were and my 10 minutes in 10 days still would’ve been enough to not create that trouble had I been not coward enough to constantly tell her that I don’t care about how beautiful you are physically cause you’ve become too egotistical about it the point was that I didn’t understand her attitude to me cause I thought being in a family why would she bother so much about sludges and not reciprocate me which she has ever done for 15 years while I didn’t feel I was doing anything wrong cause my bunch’s state was universally known she surely knew Trace and Gary’s commitment and honesty they never said what wasn’t right to her regarding my bunch’s state nor would Professor even if the whole world will but exactly that was my illusion of being an honest man let the world perish and that is what refined form of selfishness is Daisy I admit it cause the idea of the world in real honesty doesn’t exist hence as my Guzzy says ethics,morality and honesty becomes one in the behaviour of the person who interacts with the world with this view..I’m sorry but I have to mention them cause that’s what I’m..anyway as I was saying I was in illusion with my ego of honesty cause being her husband that I’ve become as soon as I returned from Sinnoh in her mind most firmly if not Kanto and no I have never had any thought of any reservation from you three of all people cause of our relations for 15 years and to the closest possible extent that she wanted to have a family in her subconscious but never told me directly just said wants to marry me officially which I told her I’m not yet ready cause my bunch can’t take more than two months break and I didn’t want to give her a ring a leave next day it would’ve been same as a false ring which was my idea where I was totally wrong as well as I realize now but I realized her actual want as well and just told her this region will be last for me before atleast a 6 month break cause I anyway had to cool down after what my bunch started at Sinnoh-end it would’ve meant they would’ve cooled down as well..and then in those months we will have all our dreams which she agreed to hence was so aghast at first the torment that she faced here then with my behaviour and there her demand was that atleast I should’ve listened to her once and spoke like her husband once that giving her strength no matter the language as I said I needed to be proactive not reactive that I was to her illusion despite understanding it my illusion notwithstanding,a husband’s duty is charted as so only cause it’s possible in illusion I was guilty not deluded..thus I should’ve given her strength rather than showing her weakness exactly what was my own weakness and cowardice then and thus the paying heed to the words and extracting their meaning in full not in partial alone with a huge bias before decision making should’ve been from me of her and not the other way around that’s my mistake for which she has suffered so much but there’s more to it cause as I said what I said just now wouldn’t have been possible more than once or twice may be a month cause of what whole world knows and thus it ever vexed me downright that I was never told about her plight with the pestering and what her husband wasn’t doing then in detail and a few vultures hovering around here and there cause they smelt blood finally with my activities of so-called duality at Unova,thus this absence of words that I expected apart from her is something I don’t understand cause Daisy you might not have liked me since day one neither has Violet nor Lillie wholeheartedly but barring Gary cause he and Lillie was in same situation as that of me and Mehu with the stardom but there were other people who are most perfect in dealing with these situations cause they aren’t emotional like me and Gary and they did like me cause it was a long time relationship with them but still I can understand Trace he did all what he could as I said he himself was confused with him passing illusions then but this doesn’t allow me to encompass the other in my field of cognition cause it was a 15 year long relation not 12 and the difference is Trace wasn’t there none was there on a certain day none in the whole world except this one person and me and his Onix on a certain occasion this person’s other half was in illusion I knew that but this person wasn’t most assuredly..this person still intrigues me Brock whose that human(laughs).. ” Brock(solemn) : “so your concern is that I of all and alone knowing you for 15 years having been present on those 10 fateful minutes on your first ever registered unofficial challenge and then subsequently traveling with you in 4 regions for around 8 years and also being a former full time qualified gym leader myself no matter how short my tenure had been should’ve understood that you’re not expecting to move on from your girlfriend nor has a problem with the duality which will continue to intrigue me cause you’re trying to deflect it still(Seth laughs)..yeah right anyway but you were expecting that I would’ve coerced you to behave as a husband to your wife not a boyfriend cause I was indeed a neutral observer to the whole illusion thus it never troubled me and unlike Zed I was interested in it not unattached like him..I was thoughtful of it unlike Margin,mentally congruous to it unlike Blithie and mostly aware of it in gross unlike your twin(Seth laughs)..and why I didn’t do all these is most simple cause your behaviour to your friend wasn’t that if you care to remember and yeah had I stepped a foot out of 11 city circle your bunch would’ve made it vanish in thin air before their cry for help reach me halfway excluding the medium cause neither Margin nor Blithie could stop the gross or mental and even Zed was powerless to stop that from the point of view of emotion cause they are who they are but they can’t control the gross only reject it which won’t work always unless the that is sound enough cause it’s not them but others..” Seth(straight) : “Brock you know why I went to so many public places cause I needed one word may be if that helped me it was with a begging bowl in reality but we can beg only in the virtual hence the appearance was completely different to you anyway Brock you again is the only person who knew to the full extent of my attitude to female fans before Unova was known to me existentially at Rimsable Mehu herself knew but as it became an existent entity Brock on the backdrop of my bunch’s state and Sinnoh final I couldn’t maintain that cause they would’ve disturbed my training finally then forcing me to spend 24 hours in front of press as my bunch slaughtered all including them so I was being polite only exactly what Mehu has done ever but for me doing that and Mehu was different cause I never bothered about anyone going crazy after a star Mehu was cause Mehu’s nature is too sweet in general she can’t transact as I do with the world thus has to babysit even the sludges cause that’s what she is and had it been Mehu in my position with that accident anytime at my career meant she would’ve quited her profession..Mehu by the end of Unova tried to take herself away from me all her emotions everything is only with me I’m her breathing spot she needs me to free herself up from everything no not psychophysically just the idea that she has me as a being as an entity and if she doesn’t have my reciprocation thus despite in her mind she being the one having objectified me as psychophysical her behaviour becomes totally erratic and that’s exactly what she was doing for 5 years that’s the 17 year old teenager that her core is with the whole world she wants that only nothing else and is visibly out with me cause that sweet nature of her finds her soul in me and I knowing that even if intuitively didn’t care about it as much as I should have has been my regret cause I blindfolded myself that the intuition of mine is fooling me and that 15 year if goes in vein with one picture and lack of contact the reasons of which she herself knew cause she was a customer at my starter lab,had Glalie and stardom she knew as well as the public stunts and that incident incensed me to a level where I needed to be all alone else my mad bunch would’ve caught it and would’ve gone to higher levels of lunacy taking me with them and then may be the whole world currently my twin’s Chu alone is a Lightenthunstrom at normal most level and both our Zekroms are currently 4 levels above him and that lunacy has to be tackled cause they are jovial as they don’t have any fear they know they can’t better that so will die if case arises and is alright with it no matter how strange it may sound that’s who they are but they will for only me try to better that and kill both me and them in the process unless I control so yeah all this is to say that yes unless I was present you would’nt have known about my bunch fully and you couldn’t go there to me cause you were busy Brock but I could afford that time in telecommunications as I said and even if not time surely no matter you could’ve spoken in the right way with Mehu not doing what is my guilt NOT NOT GIVING YOU ENOUGH TIME TO PONDER OVER YOUR ACTIONS..anyway,I behaved like a textbook coward to Mehu but I again tell you I may die tomorrow don’t except that me being present with Ms Mehadi Waterflower or Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum no matter what you may want to call her cause she won’t be present without the current me cause it’s only the current real me and she’s the same only in a different form nothing else thus that previous me doesn’t exist and in gross terms her actions with the whole world are just my antics presented in a polite manner and my silent yearning for her reflects from her as that blind all devouring devotion from me we need each other to remain psychophysically stable as a being and now if death atleast she or me would know the other didn’t go away from this body without fully knowing the other’s sentiment in all due honesty so anyway(laugh)..no this is exactly why Daisy I can’t be a two faced b.. it’s not easy especially if they are present..anyway,as I saiid the reality will remain so no matter us or our little illusions of being soulmates thus after this long discourse,we go back to our first two questions,Brock don’t we cause I concur that you’re assured of your guilt not illusion(laugh)..” Brock(solemn) : “well whatever you may think or say Seth about my guilt your true relationship or the reality,just proceed with answering why you did what you did in all regards for these 5 years and no we understand the press and you don’t have to validate your alleged private life or tell us about how much you cherish your wife,just validate your actions to us and to Mehadi as well as to how after 5 years of absolutely no contact,suddenly you come and make things too easy to not get a suspicion over your motives no matter what Mehadi herself may think it to be cause as you said Seth the duality can be established or removed only via right steps of logic..” Seth(smile) : “perfect point Brock,perfect point,that if I’ve come to this realization after 5 years of full promiscuity or ardent contemplation is indeed a factor that no matter what you think Mehu I must clarify to them cause they are my family not only by means of useless words or valueless intelligence and thus my duty to tell them cause they saw what you did in this regard not me so Brock,well I give you why I did what I did for 5 years cause surely I can’t blow away the allegations unless I make the press to time travel or the contemplative parts as well,so to start with my actions to my childhood friends(laugh),surely friends not family Brock no matter your guilt or my relationship or the reality(laugh)..anyway,well all I wanted to was to create a nice little beautiful comfortable hell for me with a most gorgeous and beautiful flame which was a bit too much warm for more comfort..” Brock(sternly) : “Seth,you’re talking not with your travel companion anymore alright no matter what so..” Seth(frown) : “So? Do I have to like Dase confess my longing for my beau..(bursts into laughter)” Daisy(scream) : “Ketchum,you..”
Tracey(solemn,controls Daisy) : “it’s alright Seth,but I’d love it if you can be more polite and you know why cause you yourself are implying more than family.”
Seth(solemn) : “I oblige Mr Skechit definitely but no the family is in question here cause it was to all of you then as to how to stay on as a family despite being family from both sides but when you are the big bro to one and also to the other but the two are fiancees or like that then then how to manage yourself indeed difficult but anyway that is questioned and is getting proved here only cause you surely knew how to achieve it as it’s legally established now so the most important gross basis is already done,anyway,that is alright but Doctor Slate if you think because I didn’t contact you for 5000 years or said certain words no matter your guilt mean I have to declare how much your tender heart..” Brock(stern) : “please,let it go,about the family what you’re trying to say I get that bit yet I don’t get your antics with neither me nor Trace so it’s ok I understand how you’re taking this game away from my central question upon your duality(Seth laughs a lot)..(gravely)..yeah EXACTLY THAT..I’ll be back to you once you make sure Trace has to leave so for them atleast just tell me that you’re not going to break Mehadi’s heart..” Seth(grinning) : “break Mehadi’s heart?break Mehadi’s heart?..that’s a funny one coming for you of all people Brock but that’s the IDEA of yours so beloved..anyway,so I’ll break my wife’s heart immediately after engagement for which I can’t and won’t have any problems myself AT ALL but to anyway..(laugh)..”
Brock(sternly) : “Seth,please,be calm and continue what you were saying” Seth(smile) : “as you said,if you gave me a chance only” Brock(solemn) : “Alright,restart with the hell” Seth(smile) : “fine,and thanks for patience,really where would’ve I..anyhow,as I was saying I created this beautiful hell and wished to see who jumps in and Mehu did that only she,so she’s my wife now.do you want to know now how am I planning to break her heart to assert myself of the logical soundness(laugh)?” Brock(solemn) : “this answered only your stunt on me and then your subsequent letter sending antics that yeah did me what it did and your longing once more only in circle for Mehadi who were on the same wavelength but the trouble still is yeah we may be your bros but also her as well as you yourself just admitted and now her family too by law hence we must and I surely atleast must know what you’re upto now cause before Unova the law part was just legally missing for atleast you,Gary and Tracey that much I know the later two just because of many other factors not so visible that too you know very well” Seth(laugh) : “yeah before Unova what was happening I know very well but the circle that you just said is really intriguing Brock cause ok fine it won’t be uncomfortable at all if me and Mehu are married to separate people now but you the similar situation cause I’ll be anywhere in the world except here hence it doesn’t matter but that is the case that would’ve happened still had I not been harsh on you and so on but they are settled now cause those other people turned out to be only Mehu and me so this circle gets more interesting as actually what bugs you is that someone else for Mehu after Mr Green Nipron(stops Mehadi from interveneing by  er too firmly)..just a sec don’t leave..(to Mehadi)..please Mehu that’s their trouble actually your actions are upto you,you know that and you know me I’m not budging from saying all to them cause I love them as much as you do and this illusion will only go with this sort of language that you saw,please...” Mehadi(tears, oy very firmly,shivering voice) : “I want my husband alive in this body with me unless he wants to kill me with him you know that and remember that...” Seth(smile,patting Mehadi’s cheeks) : “you will have your husband all the time in this body this is too easy Mehu I’ve been under all covers done all sorts of medicines for 20 years,don’t worry it’s helping me only if they pampered me my happiness will increase that is rather more concerning(laugh) don’t bother dear please nothing will happen I know what I was doing with you there as well don’t bother..(back to call) sorry just Mehu was a bit emotional with that name..so after that person others could also have been in if I gave them a chance?” Brock(solemn) : “exactly and same for you yourself if nothing at all worked which it didn’t else given undercover you would’ve been back after or before and this is the same thing that we being your bros were trying to tell you cause it wasn’t even a month then when you turned on us and you know best Seth what I’m talking about it wouldn’t have mattered even you stayed here cause you were going to Kalos then Accumula and we know as well what it takes to build up something like Accumula hence the ring only clasps on you even more Seth just that(Seth laughs) and else surely it was a possibility and you know the cases of ex where they agree to not disturb each others further personal lives that was the solution we indicated nothing more,anyway that is then this is now,but Mehadi being here still don’t mention names that’s upto you cause we know too well the names and what they did afterwards that it was a mistake from them as well from us and those chapters were closed ages ago just the idea I’m giving that I know as do you Mehadi did give people chances atleast and Mehadi herself knows this more than anyone that atleast yeah I’m being cruel to you Mehadi but don’t worry your husband can counter anything and I know that most so he will come out if he is honest which is my question to discretely make him tell us now that he has the vocabulary in abundance in gross terms too unlike previous(Seth laughs a lot) so yeah Mehadi did but didn’t get the right reply,but she could’ve as well,as could you,so this is still an open problem no matter how comfortable your hell is cause what is the reason behind your reasoning that indeed it had to be Mehadi who was your soulmate and couldn’t be anyone else” Seth( ehadi firmly,smile) : “exactly that word Brock-soulmate.Well Brock,before coming here today for the last one month behind the whole world’s back I’ve quired the 2 concerned persons the most going at their living rooms and they frankly said including the discrete names that I mentioned that the whole affair in 5 years regarding Mehadi Waterflower’s actions were confusing to her the most and the 3rd is just Mr Georges(laughs) it’s always fortune Brock if you meet an once ever legend no matter what sometimes it takes time and just that and no he was just what he is a sweet little kid no more and he confirmed it once more thus no about giving chances if people go to sea they will get drenched if a wave goes over them but the wave doesn’t understand what is happening to the persons cause it wasn’t created or directed or had any intention of doing so to begin with and the concerned persons if doesn’t realize that then it’s not the wave’s fault and this the discretely mentioned name expressed the most as they realized me after hunting for my head at Accumula of all places situating in a region whose dragons has surrendered their myth to me wholeheartedly when I was 14 and half 26 long long years back to propel themselves beyond imagination as Trace and Daisy knows what they now do so there they went yet was saved from being rescinded of their license and thus livelihood cause they only thought Mehadi Waterflower was cheated to an extent by me from which only my head would’ve appeased her they realized that the Mehadi Waterflower they took as real was an illusion first second they had nothing to do with her ever and not doing so was hindering their own lives and they were honest enough to express that to all of you including Mehadi herself may be to her their approach wasn’t right cause by then they were too greatful to me and in my last talk with them at their very own office for many many hours they again confirmed that all the 3 were there due to own illusions and no reciprocration was ever there the dates were asked for by them was replied to positively in illusion by the gym leader and ever scoffed off with extreme rudeness questioning their manhoods each time before getting out of home even so you understand if Mehadi Waterflower gave a chance or that they were encouraged by your own illusion as to moving on is right may I continue without resentment from any of you cause I also know your own lives and who you are only too well no matter what you think and I know it was an illusion for all of us but this to remind you only that if I die tomorrow may she be left undistrubed unless she herself decides otherwise so may I continue..” Brock(solemn) : “continue”
Seth(smile) : “most gladly,see Mehu,it’s not a problem and by-the-way,oh my goodness I completely and absolutely forgot,all of you,please bare with what I call my wife,a name Brock that’s too familier to you,I used to call her Mehu in Kanto itself after my 3rd badge,and you were there so I only hope for compliance”
Brock(sternly) : “you know best you don’t need anyone’s compliance and please be serious enough to end this cause we don’t have eternity just move along”
Seth(smile) : “with pleasure,but the thing is that there’s still enough time for me to say that no your choises weren’t by any means wrong either neither was Victor’s certificate cause all you wanted was to see your most dear little sis back to her normal exuberant self and yeah the men were good enough by all means and surely Mr Green Nipron was and I’ve no personal contacts with him neither he for obvious reasons but he looks upto me now in a way that people do to a old wise teacher and I’ve much respect and affection for him as well you’ll gradually come to know all of it(laugh) I’m laughing cause he also has wholeheartedly accepted what I told him to don’t bother about your will rather yourself and is too happy now with his soulmate soon to be Mrs Clara Sinrab Nipron one time conference winner Kanto I’ve even spoken to her once all just courtsey and it’s just a happy family they are now so this is just to appologize to them and to clarify myself in the end going into round 64 and beyond twice is impossible unless the core is made of real iron not illusive what to speak of being a champion and that’s my point everywhere and as he realizes it distinctly all the more now that exudes from him and will as well and you’ll see so you see for me giving people chances or not my view is that whoever came before or after Mehu to me except my mom and my Pokemons were there for a reason that my soul didn’t represent as it’s not made of reasons,and mom well that’s a relation of a completely different plane and thus in the plane that we’re concerned here,Mehu gets the vote of my soul”
Brock(solemn) : “so your belief is that she was destined to you?” Seth(firmly) : “see I don’t like this idea of being destined,so I’d prefer the word that you yourself said a few moments back SOULMATE.”
Brock(solemn) : “and all else that will come can’t be that?” Seth(solemn) : “right.cause this word you know as well as do all is only envisaged to get rid of all else do you not agree?” Brock(solemn) : “yeah if only provided with logic still unlike all else but you due to your admitted steadfastness” Seth(smile) : “high-handedness indeed,but I gave you my reason why soulmate and not the word so beloved that’s destiny as IT IS NOT proper for that reason as well.” Brock(solemn) : “Seth,you might know I’m a practicing full time Pokemon doctor now by profession,lets play a game of logic shall we? Seth(smile) : “much obliged and Brock because this also is in public gospel that Seth Ketchum indeed helped to bust Team Rocket legally,you shall know that I know exactly well of your achivements since the day you parted after Sinnoh and by virtue of that absolutely who you are and so on as you’re Professionally involved in Pokemon World,so congratulations for that...but lets see what’s the outcome of LOGIC,I’m excited,only Q/A right?” Brock(solemn) : “right,can I start?”
Seth(smile) : “ever at service”
Brock(solemn) : “right,let’s play,Mehadi comes that day,you have an accident,she follows you for her bike,finds your tender care to Pikachu and for reasons that can’t be expressed in language falls for you.stay with me on this point.ok?”
Seth(smile) : “continue”
Brock(solemn) : “1.it could’ve been M for her,2.it could’ve been F for you and 3.Mehadi falls BECAUSE of you Seth Ketchum,so there’s a REASON if you know what I mean,now logically cross these inferences”
Seth(smile) : “gladly,2.Its no as I could’nt have even remotely cared about F which atleast I did for Mehu cause atleast for the next 2 days I didn’t part company in that forest which I could if I wanted no matter what she was doing and you that well and then you were the first hand witness since day four till the unfortunate break-up that I’ve had with my then girlfriend,who happens to be my wife now,my in-your-words previous relationship with Mehu from start to that break-up existed for 17 years and you know every detail cause you were eavesdropping just as Tracey all the time to know more than me about my feelings and subsequent behaviour or the lack of those for and with Mehu and you can get your 1 from here,and you know more than me that if you go further with this then that’ll prove I’m dead exactly right now so lest proceed..so the third is that,yeah to cut logically where logic is more subtle than language first yeah may be I looked nice,yeah may be my warmth for my starter a bit that was enticing to her and so on then yeah she had a crush and anyway had to start her journey in 6 months starting from that so tagged along fine but first she wasn’t at all prepared to journey alongside me hence had to buy so many things that very night and next which ok she had a crush on me didn’t want to lose sight fine,then I atleast never wanted her to follow me on the first two days as you know which she ever told you all so ok she was infatuated too much but you know if there’s a reason for infatuation then it’s about virtues or physicality none of the routes were taken by her at all as it felt to me,yeah she wanted to hug me and so on but never did and if accidental or in that forest at 17 first region you understand can happen never it felt to me as meaning anything more than just my friend and so on and I surely didn’t have any chance to show warmth to anyone in the first 2 years atleast that wasn’t normal to her or you then and she was from a city sister of Cerulean City gym leader and also the sensational sisters the original duo Violet and Lillie she knew and saw many before me and during our travel never once did that make sure that she behaves anyhow different to me because of them yeah in Pasio she tries to play a few jealousy tricks TWICE in 5 years that is cause she was 20 then and that is because she didn’t have the reciprocation from me especially after my Kanto final that she then could understand in her then existent cognitive powers and no all she wanted was that I confess to her that she is my girlfriend which to her meant wife and absolutely nothing else thus you see Brock none roams around with another through all that for 7 years and 3 months just for infatuation despite no reciprocation for atleast the first one and half of it and this infatuation was to marry the person and nothing else for which her devotion to him you all saw and this all is despite who she was herself and all that was happening around her then she was an amusing trainer,had a bit of name herself in Pasio then in Johto was familier cause of her skills many met her great people certainly better than me in skills atleast then but she never budged to anything despite many advances as I myself faced as you saw first hand and all this surely isn’t infatuation atleast as it is not when she within the first month with many troubles came to me for the solutions despite you being there and you were 8 years older,known to her sister who was your admitted girlfriend,a gym leader then surely were much better a resort and no one thing is to talk another is when you have actual trouble that isn’t infatuation for sure cause(laugh,Mehadi hugs Seth very firmly with little tears) infatuation is about others this isn’t anyway,she never complained that I was vulgar with her then surely(laugh) anyway her devotion was ever there for all to see too much,which is why I don’t like the word destined cause I did the same but again to prove my side is why this play has come into existence in the first place so anyway,yeah you got your points.”
Brock(solemn) : “unsuccessful on the third cause ok it could be utmost devotion for her and not infatuation but surely there was too much warmth throughtout atleast the first month that I know and in the forest too yeah I could reliably assume cause yeah to you it may not be out of ordinary to her that wasn’t the case may be hence may be the infatuation was in your case from which you woke up after Unova where your bunch forced you into far depths of yourself I understand and no Seth you understand that it’s not a trouble and we understand it’s not a trouble for you to do what you did afterwards and exactly why we’ve started all this and my doubt of you that the third point actually is why are you back again so try again on that note that cause we don’t understand your position at all since Unova thus before that so actually the third is what actually assures you that neither Mehadi was ever infatuated with you despite you hinting the same after Unova cause she wanted you physically here you couldn’t be hence if not infatuated she would’ve realized and you the same in viseversa if weren’t surely would’ve been atleast polite with her even once in all those 2 years or so thus it isn’t clear to us at all cause we have had to see how much plight Mehadi was in that was pushing her slowly to the eventual and the exact opposite in you cause your bunch was too happy with everything so no it isn’t clear even if you were so happy without any human relations of any kind why suddenly are you back then which you yourself rejected at Unova so the suspicion remains of your motives and you can get my in-your-words insinuations from here still cause I’m not at all out of it”
Seth(solemn) : “so Doctor Brock Slate 2nd eldest bro-in-law,Dr Tracey Skechit eldest bro-in-law and Mrs Daisy Waterflower Skechit eldest sis of my wife Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum wants to know from me whether indeed I have had the idea that my wife is ever Mehu to me.I see,fine,but before that I have to again prove that her attitude of Seth wasn’t infatuation despite her in-your-words giving chances to so and so then lease bear with me then.agree?”
Brock(solemn) : “agree”
Seth(solemn) : “well about Mehu you see may be my warmth made Mehu fall for me even more in the forest,was one moment or innumerable in 7 days or a month enough for the initial 7 years of blind devotion AND even more importantly from second day onwards and certainly you came on 10th atleast,what did she always say of me -’Seth’ wasn’t it? And yeah I had warmth for her in the forest but SO DID SHE surely I wasn’t there to detect if my travel compaion being not of my gender has a crush on me or just her natural warmth or not was I Brock(laugh) and no that ‘Seth’ wasn’t warmth or crush it was much much more higher and most intense longing cause well except her only my mom ever had that attitude to me as long as I’m concerned and you can get Mehu’s beloved infatuation of 23 years from 17 and half to 40 and half according to you resolved from here and yeah you can continue.”
Brock(solemn) : “well that’s only one side and not the otherwise and there were more of whom,you might’ve forgotten to check the the motives or the lack of it for that matter and among them some were there for 3,some 2 and so on,so on..”
Seth(laugh) : “sorry for laughing but couldn’t resist cause no matter my words May will be my very own little sis across all eternity even if she disagrees(laugh),anyway,(Solemn)..Brock,are you sure except for my female travel companions and that’s precisely one anyway I’ll mention it later but you’re saying I never dated or kept emotional contact with any other girl long enough?”
Brock(solemn) : “well in our 8 years of companionship no you didn’t but you see Seth you game of deferring isn’t going to work”
Seth(laugh) : “all hail Rimsable absolutely Brock no doubts(laughs)..keep an hour off cause it’s so deliecious that you’ll come to this point of my life Brock MADDENING(laughs a lot)..”
Daisy(frown) : “just tell us the reason for your meltdowns despite rejections(Seth laughs)..” Seth(laugh) : “this game of logical snooker INDEED(laughs)..no wonder you and Brock are who you are across scales of time Daisy anyway the rejection was the sufficiency that I don’t get enbroiled into duality no matter the necessity which was the meltdown cause I needed mental closure neither emotional nor physical I wanted to forget the duality by duality that’s my sweet Mehadi oh I’m terribly sorry for being emotional(laughs a lot)..” Daisy(solemn) : “keeping that in mind I hope you will be to the point” Seth(smile) : “thanks indeed I’ll thanks,so anyway Brock about my travel companions who weren’t of my gender and came along with me and among them there was one except May whom you personally know very well cause you were there youself Ms Dawn Berlitz one time conference winner at Sinnoh,her region when we did travel together where you were there as well and she is my little sis as well so much younger to me and you know perfectly well how much we adored her there cause she was so much younger to both of us and so sweetly expressive a girl so no you’re not talking about her but then you know well enough about the other travel companion that wasn’t of my gender Mrs Iris Arissu Rarcia,hall of fame first position now settled down with her husband Doctor Ferdinand Rarcia,general pokemon doctor was in undercover with us..Iris is just as Stashey is to me and has been through undercover too for 8 years now strangely though Brock and this is what I was saying she was shattered wanted to kill me had all her resentments yet never played this game of logic neither has Daisy infact nor will my mom nor will Tony boy nor will Humpie but will be exactly you and the irony is you know me the closest in training not in action what they did cause I did things during training that only has helped me to up in the action(laughs)..” Brock(solemn) : “that’s part of duality you know best Seth hence your training of vigil that’s inseparable to anything else including testing being in action is still going and will till you’re dual the exact trouble for taking it into the real that’s my question..” Seth(laughing a lot) : “THUNDURUS!(bursts into laughter)..yeah I admit Brock but you see Brock you know about Iris via my friend,brother,compeer,philosopher and guide and other travel companion there Mr Cilan Cubin and no this is also not what you’re wanting to talk about but you precisely want to talk about my Kalos Journey and well yeah then there was another about whom too I thought you now know very well enough now to insinuate this to me cause I thought through multiple sources,parties and so on you’ve come to know and so now from what you’ve seen and reliably heard wasn’t neither their nor anyone else that’s not of my gender that ever met me whose attitude to me was all about- ‘Seth is or has’,but not -‘Seth’ ? “ Brock(solemn) : “yes.” Seth(smile) : “most humbled,so I guess you’ll walk with me if I say that barring a certain female companion of mine in Kalos all that were there including general professional colleagues and friends except my family whom you know as much as I do and all except them were never allowed to lyrically complement my flesh and blood and so on be it in undercover or above it cause the undercover if were like that I surely wouldn’t have been going off to Kalos of all places where my possible so and so was under observation for may be innumerable years and whole world knew my whereabouts in Kalos where I went two months after the final at Team Rocket and surely for all three years despite all attempts not one word could’ve been extracted from anyone that I was licentious there and I tell you yeah I’ve had the chance but the newses couldn’t be confirmed despite public gospel that you follow strangely despite all anyway are you walking with me that I had nothing to do with people who were there with me for flesh and blood and surely you know most perfectly that I could always tell who were so and what my behaviour was with them and no surely my Giratina required more time from me than any so and so and also there were many everywhere who were as PHYSICALLY beautiful as Ms Mehadi Waterflower was if there ever was a minute scale for that thus are you walking when I say none were given a chance at public stunts by me exactly why they are called so ?” Brock(solemn) : “walking.”
Seth(smile) : “I thank you whole-heartedly,now to proceed with this certain female travel companion whose antics through a certain note must’ve become the very first line in your gospel in the chapter dealing with me,also did pull some more antics in a certain call which also must be in the Playboy Ketchum chapter of you gospel has been included as the most insignificant footnote that those antics no matter how great an actress she may be and is but those are not exactly of the nature from someone whom I’ve dated for 2 years no matter why she came with me to begin with.so if I say that that certain person in my 40 years here is the single worst stoolworm in my view cause she knows most well what I did to and for her and what I got and why my consequent actions to her on being at the receiving end would you keep walking with me?”
Brock(solemn) : “ with you sentiment yes with your language of it’s description absolutely not.” Seth(smile) : “many thanks indeed Brock.the language will come to it’s fruitation only if you can hold your patience and I absolutely assure you of that guranteeing myself cause it’s more than well tested being logical so anyway,then I’m sure you’ll agree in human world,if I broaden this and include all in my hell everyone would be not getting out of it except my mom and another person whose position is still disputed but let me include the person as well with all else,so then if brief if I say that except my mom each person has come to me for a reason be it a moment of affection only to hand me over a glass of water due to me not being able to reach it as my sitting position in the table hindered me to and I took the opportunity cause they didn’t charge an amount,would you be alongside me?” Brock(solemn) : “will.”
Seth(smile) : “right,perfect.so all I have to proove is that my mom has someone to accompany her and that’s my wife Mehu about whom I need to proove that according to me,she has ever cherished me for no reason to the extent which you all know that at that plane that word cherish makes no sense cause that’s just husband and wife which all of you know understand in your own lives if you didn’t say 23 years ago practically if not theoretically exactly like her and me included isn’t that so?”
Brock(solemn) : “exactly”
Seth(smile) : “right,so then Mehu saying ‘Seth’ from day 2 and my mom saying ‘Seth’ from day 2 is still different to you?
Brock(solemn) : “precisely.”
Seth(smile) : “yeah perfect the next phase of the game is going to be a bit too cold for a bit too uncomfort and thus I’ll have to ask Mehu if she can bear...”
Mehadi(firmly, oy very firmly) : “Mehadi Ketchum will bear with anything that her husband says with only a very small complain that no matter what her husband did today,he deserved atleast his first night alone with her,alright lets continue.”
Seth(smile, ehadi very firmly) : “right Mehu,stay along this is only the meltdown part of snooker(laughs)..”
Mehadi(sternly) : “Seth..”
Seth(laughs  er more firmly) : “could’ve listened to records anyway so to start Brock,about the number of chances given to get out of the hell will be absolutely zero because that’s the whole point of the hell it isn’t it?”
Brock(solemn) : “yes.”
Seth(smile) : “great.so you see Brock,the logic is that those wanting the chances you will find does so because their central reason to be personal with me has been broken and thus they’re no more comfortable to get out and come back to me all by themselves thus you fail my very first filter then if you’ve managed to come back once but not twice,twice but not thrice,infinitely many times but not the very next time and so on,then you fail my second filter,but even if you did,I’ll cheat on you,be with someone else or have a family with someone else,be loyal to them,and as many combinations you can create you may create and I’ll do all that individually to you infinitely many times and not stop still but if you STILL want me ONLY no matter the iteration number,then you’ve surpassed my first step that ok you’re elligible atleast.then I’ll kill you by poisoning you and reveal to you that yes I’m your murderer and before death you’ll ONLY want me,ONLY your murderer will be wanted by you,then you pass the 2nd door IF you can repeat what has been told just before,now while you’re dying knowing that I killed you and I’m laughing in front you watching your slow death telling you that I’m your murderer indeed,then if you gleefully want to be killed by me again and again and again and again and STILL say you’ll not but want me ONLY again and again and be RATHER killed again and again by me than be with me for just one moment if the former assured ultimate unison though uncertain in temporal scale,then it’s the third,now you’ll bear all pain for me while I’m in hell but you’re in heaven,if I’m starving on a secluded jungle,you’re with the best of foods with your spouse and childern happily loyally married yet feeling my starving only and is actually DYING with me and you’d ONLY want to die with me and ONLY wish to be able to be with me and starve TOGETHER,and repeat that again and again,then it’s the fourth door..and conversely for 5 th you’ll be the greatest destitute me the greatest king,yet you’ll be king too in your mind happily only thinking of me..no matter what I’m what I do you won’t leave me you wont stop your pursuit for me,you’ll never have me ever but this very absolute impossibility to have me through all eternity will only make you totally lunatic in my pursuit,you’re whole being will only know one thing that it doesn’t matter what,I’ll not desist to have you though I know I wont ever have..this assured failure will not defeat you,you’ll be invincibility epitomized in my pursuit in my want in your longing for me in your yearning for me,in your heart-wrenching death for me-(grave)YOU WILL BECOME-IMMORTAL..(straight)that immortality though is only the 6th stage to hell(bursts into laughter)..um..sorry,just came off..anyway(laugh),this only opens up the door to 7th,which is alright I’ll take you up,alright I’ll be with you and so on faithfully that is etc but I won’t have a family with you,I will force you to my whims and that is you will not have anything called future and so on and I’ll force you to be with other people despite being married to me and so on or sell you as a slave or torture you each day and do all imaginable brutalities psychophysically and emotionally and so on but you still will want ONLY ONLY me beyond that exact psychophysicality and emotions and about the future no you won’t have any from me that is(laugh)cause why bother about it if that is why you’re with me than basically you fail the very first door isn’t it exactly why I said only from me there’s no future for you that is and that is cause if you don’t agree then it simply shows that you’re here for the body and so on cause that is random sampling again and that’s just like herd again a particular couple like Gengar has only one partner throughtout life but still it could be anyone hence you turn out to be biggest vulgar being existing(laugh) cause to you the future and so on is again blood and sweat and so on only hence a matter of yourself not about the future that is you want a robot or a plaything totally dependent upon you rather than being connected to that as your own extension and so on but most importantly you think it’s just the body which isn’t the case is it? I could’ve been born anywhere could’ve been could’ve been could’ve been hallucinations(laugh),anyway,sorry for this as well but anyway this is only the route to 8th(laugh),no it’s funny really the unbinding of being(laugh),anyway,step 8th is that you fulfil all the previous 7 UNTILL I die next moment(laugh) that is if I die tomorrow and my wife jumps away next day from me(hugs Mehadi very firmly and stops her from talking,Mehadi crying,hugs Seth very firmly)..so that means all your sweetness and devotion is only till I psychophysically die(laugh)/that is right after I had accepted you you said it’s only cause you’re my(laugh)/but then I go off from this term to the unknown that’s just really me/but you say I’m sorry dear,just have to continue here without thee(laugh) hence you move on..to 1,2,3..umpteenth number of husbands and so on then it’s no good is it(laugh)..cause then there’s no difference to you and a conspiring murderer ain’t it(laugh)..thus once I marry you that’s it for you no matter my temporal existence and thus you will bear all pain for me thinking of my presence always with you in abstraction thus you are categorized as being only with me..but this only proves that you’re about to go to step 9(laugh)..no PLAYBOY LIFE Brock,just so maddening(laugh)..then you go on to step 9 that is if I die or reject you or kill you or do anything as I stated in the last 8 steps AND you become sad due to any or all of those stages and steps..I miss you,I want you,I recall you,I’m living only because of you(laugh)..and so on..you’re independent of me dear why bother about the other if it’s you and thus is never another(laugh)..man Squirtle life is indeed DEEPENING(laugh)..anyway,this means you are around me cause of your own self that is soul,that can never be abounded by my or your psychophysical existence thus you fulfil this step if only you know you’re me thus I’m you thus where’s anything to be(laugh)..thus you know you’re just me hence just too happy no matter what is there from me cause it’s you thus the viseversa and exactly thus is NOTHING at all ain’t it(laugh)..thus you must be too happy no matter your and my psychophysicality cause comparing this to your assumed relation with me it’s just NOTHING TO BEAUTY(laugh)..but no this only fulfils step 9 much left to do(laugh) cause upto this you’ve only proved you are among a select few only(laugh)..surely all else can do these for me can’t they in this very world during my lifespan how many do I meet among all that is present as human here or even pokemon or like that(laugh)..in my cognition of my stage of this particular existence of mine as a being how can I know that you have transcended time and space afterall(laugh)..and if you have still means you’re rather in potential now anyone could come from there to me the cloud of potential means you are never only one thus it’s rather contradictory to your uniqueness to me ain’t it(laugh)..20 infinite many billions year later there could be someone that will want me more or was before(laugh)..really how do you know(laugh)..then you’re nothing to that person are you(laugh)..or even if you’re talking about potential thus impossibility of individuality then ok it’s STILL only you in future or past but that’s not you NOW cause surely you’re not at all fully BLOOMED in your yearning for me rather much short of it aren’t you(laugh)..so your’re NOTHING TO BEAUTY YET(laugh)..thus you’re nowhere at all hence you can never stop thinking about me or try to develop your yearning for me that is natural evolution thus your very birth means you’ve only stopped it by restricting it by psychophysicality that is how can you know you are indeed you that is you’re genuine at all cause you’ve just decided to stop your non psychophysical evolution to the full yearning for me thus this very existence of you is to be kicked out by me shouldn’t it(laugh)..anyway just funny it is Brock this Playboy life you know it’s just nothing except BEAUTY(laugh) and it will get way worse than even this with 10th and so on coming so now,all couples present here it’ll get more and more uncomfortable from here so if you want please leave,except Brock and Mehu,you know your position.”
Tracey,Daisy(unison,Daisy shivering voice,Tracey with a broad smile) : “we’ll go to the end” Seth(smile) : “much appreciated Trace not for you Dase so be prepared till the second warning that’s now” (All except Mehadi in unison,Tracey and Brock with a broad smile Daisy in shivering voice) : “continue” Mehadi(profuse tears,shivering) : “Brock,you..you still want more(scream,crying) MY PRIVATE LIFE,Dase..you..(crying loudly)it’s MY PRIVATE LIFE with MY HUSBAND..this is my first..you’re my..(chokes)..” Seth(whispering in Mehadi’s ears) : “Mehu they are married too this is their life as well I’m universalizing ours only to include them no psychophysicality hum(laughs,Mehadi crying  im)..and no it’s ok sweetie( ehadi)just leave it upon me dear.” Mehadi(crying) : “I’m going and if you were..(cuts off)” Seth(smile) : “so now if only Brock stays that’ll be enough.” Brock(broad smile) : “I will walk with Seth as I’ve ever had for 8 years no matter where he goes,rest of you can go if you want” Daisy(tears): “Seth,after all the infinitude of your discourse,you think that we’re..” Seth(smile) : “no I don’t think what you’re thinking Daisy,I know what you and Trace are going through, and I also know why Brock wants to travel with me no matter what and I perfectly know why you’ve been listening to matters my private life and why Brock and Trace are emotional now mentally that is(laughs a lot,Brock and Tracey smiles)..correct me if I’m wrong Daisy, ALL.OF.YOU.ARE.LISTENING.SO.INTENTLY.CAUSE.THIS.IS.EXACTLY.WHAT.YOU.DO. See this is UNIVERSAL life for any couple soulmates that is and the infinitude is only the further generalization of it and I’m telling you cause I know how much it applies for all of you and why none of you are in general marriages like a random couple so and so I know your bonds with your soulmates and all things around that for 22 long years and thus is this.so this is YOUR very private life as well and these are YOUR very personal deeds as well and that’s why you’ve been paying so close an attention and don’t want to leave,so let me cut to the very end,even if you do all this I may not at all select you,why? AS IT’S MY CHOICE,the invincibility is to you but it has no value to me.why should it be? Totally illogical as I’m not doing the same for you,I’m not bothered about you,I JUST DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU(laugh)..and that’s what it is,it’s not MY side and it’s not MY problem or RESPONSIBILITY for YOUR feelings for me..and this is what I told you Daisy about my Pasio break my two bros and Gary too knows in abstract it is just this..THAT IT’S ME NOT YOU..totally lunatic idea if don’t you think so and this is exactly why Brock I don’t like the word DESTINY as if it was just a throwaway that you could’ve been found with anyone like I was being found according to public gospel BUT DESTINY is all that you get just a specific random one as DESTINY would have it,as if it’s all about like pokemons ah get anyone it’s just a matter of you know what nothing a big deal but this is exactly why we’re not pokemons and exactly why it’s a big deal for us unlike pokemons so now in gross terms to choose someone what will I do is that I’m going observe perfectly,persistently,precisely and with being perceptive that exactly who IS NOT destined out of random samples cause then that can definitely be called soulmate and soulmate is that if and only if I see(agitated)EXACTLY,ABSOLUTELY,PRECISELY,SOLELY MY OWN SELF,MY OWN BEING,MY OWN SOUL that is (very agitated) I and that is NOT MY THAT DIFFERENCE WILL PERSIH DEFINITELY THERE IN EACH DAMN INFINITY ACROSS ALL THE POTENTIAL EXISTENTIAL AND CONSCIOUS SPHERES UNIMAGINABLE BY THIS BRUTE CALLED THIS ILLUSIVE BEING,I IN THIS VERY LIFE WILL CROSS EVERY SINGLE HINDRENCE TO MY VERY OWN SELF BY MY OWN ILLUSION OF MY OWN BEING,(extremely agitated) I WILL NOT CEASE TILL I CROSS THROUGH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT IS HINDERING ME SO DISDAINFULLY AND AND ONLY IF I see THIS I in MY OTHER HALF,THAT IS YEAH I MADE THIS A mistAKE BY ACCEPTING THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS MY OTHER HALF THAT IS OK SOULMATE ONLY NON PSYCHOPHYSICALLY WITH ME BEYOND THE POTENTIAL AND SO ON BUT HOW THAT STATEMENT THEN CONFORMS TO THE FACT THEN EVERY SINGLE ONE BECOMES INDEPENT OF GENDER AND THUS ARE MY SOULMATES IN EACH LIFE THUS EVEN WITHOUT MY PSYCHOPHYSICALITY I STILL HAVE THE DIFFERENCE OF BEING CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF THUS THIS TROUBLE OF NEVER GETTING ME THE REAL..(very agitated)..THIS AGITATION IS FOR THE WORD DESTINY BROCK ASSIMILATE IT IN YOUR MIND THIS EXACTLY THIS I MUST SOMEHOW GET FROM MY OTHER HALF THAT SHE IS THE THE GODDMAN REALITY ONE AND ONLY THAT IS ME..JUST DAMN ME..THE REALITY..THEN AND ONLY THEN I REALLY AM REAL WITH MY REALITY AND IF I SO WANT I CAN CREATE A WORLD OUT OF IT AND CALL SOMEONE MY SOULMATE WHOM I WANT TO BE MY OTHER HALF NOTHING MORE NOTHING SPECIAL IN IT IT’S JUST ME AND THUS NEVER THEE EXACTLY WHY AT MY CURRENT STAGE OF VIEW MY SOULMATE IS PARTICULAR WHO IS THE ESSENCE OF THE WHOLE WORLD TO ME THE MOST DEAR MORE THAN MY CURRENT PSYCHOPHYSICAL EXISTENCE HENCE IT’S SHE NOT ME THUS I DON’T EXIST AT ALL AND NEITHER DOES SHE CAUSE SHE IS ME HENCE MY MY SOULMATE MUST BE ME AND ALL THE REST IN ONE EXISTENCE AND IF IT IS SO IN THIS CURRENT EXISTENCE OF MINE THEN INDEED SHE IS BEYOND SPACE,TIME AND INDIVIDUALITY CAUSE THE VERY INSTANCE OF HER APPEARENCE AS HER IN MY VIEW WANTING MYSELF TO BE ANOTHER THAT IS WANTING MYSELF IN ANOTHER FORM THAT IS NEW,THEN THIS HOLISTIC BLISS OF MINE IF IS FELT IN MY EVERY UNIMAGINABLE EXISTENTIAL VIEWS AND THAT FEELING COMES FROM A PARTICUALR POINT OUTSIDE ME AND THAT IS ALWAYS SOMEONE NOT OF MY GENDER OTHERWISE MY VIEW OF HAVING THE PSYCHOPHYSICALITY ATTACHED TO ME IN TRUEST SENSE DOESN’T FULFIL GOVES A FORM TO THE ABSTRACT OF MY FONDNESS OF ME AS MY SPOUSE AND THEN THEN,(extremely agitated)..ONLY THEN,ONLY,ONLY THEN,DOES SHE BECOME MY OTHER HALF,THEN AND ONLY THEN DOES ANY F..

ABOUT MY WIFE OR Mehadi OR ANYONE..I WANT INDIFFERENCE THE REST WHAT IS MY ILLUSION WILL DECIDE WHAT IT WILL BECOME TO ME AS I DISCERN IT..THE SAME WAY I GET MY WIFE IS THE SAME WAY I GET MY SISTER IS THE SAME WAY I GET MY AUNTY OR GRANDMA OR ANY F..

AND IT IS THE SAME WAY I GET A ROAD..S..ABSOLUETLY THE SAME..IT’S MY PROBLEM NOT THEIR CAUSE IT’S ME NOT THEM..I’LL COME THROUGH EACH ILLUSION NO MATTER WHAT AND NO MATTER WHICH WAY CAUSE IT’S ILLUSION IT WILL FALL THAT’S ALL I KNOW AND HAVE TO KNOW..AND THIS DUALITY OF THE REALITY WILL PUNISH ME BUT THAT EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF DUALITY AND REALITY IS ILLUSION TOO WHAT IS REAL IS SO REST ILLUSION THUS I WILL BE VICTORIOUS EACH TIME..THUS BY THE SAME PRINCIPLE Mehadi IS MY OTHER HALF NOW AND WILL BE ETERNALLY AS SHE HAS BEEN AND IT’S NOT ABOUT ONE OR JUST HER IT’S ABOUT INFINITY WHENEVER I HAVE AN ILLUSION OF A SPOUSE IT WILL BE MY Mehadi THAT’S IT NO MATTER ME OR HER..AND THE REASON IS EXCEPT ME THE REALITY IF NOTHING EXISTS THEN IF I’M DELUDED I’LL BECOME MY Mehadi MYSELF THE ILLUSION AND IT’S UNFOLDMENT AS THE REALITY IS ME NEVER YOU HENCE THE REST LIKE HAVING A GODFORSAKEN FAMILY..(grim a bit taken aback)..um..I’m sorry..but umm(laugh) this is what is logical snooker Brock no destiny can get it’s feeling properly enough unless they recognize themselfes detached from it no matter cunning or dashing or most importantly observing assimilate this Brock I warn you..(laughs a lot,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly crying)” Daisy(sobbing,a few moments later): “I’m leaving as well,I only wish Lil was here and not Viol cause she would’ve ruined it long ago(laughs still in tears,Tracey laughs a lot  aisy firmly,Brock and Seth bursts into laughter)..I’ll tell her later..Seth,um..would you mind if I still call you Ketchum?” Seth(laugh) : “that would actually be right Daisy,just call me anything but this self was only hindered for 23 years cause for me it’s impossible to be gentle enough to tolerate a jackal searching for the den for one day even(bursts into laughter,Daisy laughs still in tears,Tracey laughs a lot,Brock too laughs a lot)..” Daisy(tears,smile) : “enough Seth your son and daughter and brother and nephew and niece and anyone regardless of gender or appearance will all be only you..and still I’ll sometimes call you Ketchum if not all cause it so smoothly rhymes with Medicham(smiles broadly,Seth laughs),you made my day and my 23 years,I saw you first 23 years back for your second ever badge,you had just about started may be your 20th or 21st day,then you were with Mehu and I knew for sure what was going inside her and what has continued for 23 long years no matter what but my only ever problem was that I never believed in you or your skills cause I never found a reason or hint to do so no matter what even after seeing first hand what your bunch does and that was 36 dragons as a starter still can hear Lil complaining how dare you enter a water gym with a Guzzlord(smiles,Tracey and Brock smiles too,Seth laughs a lot) and that was the same even today since 16 actually then by your two twins honestly in due morality and the whole point of this was my own illusion due to my own experiences that they still don’t understand a few of human emotions but then..(tears)..I’m seeing you now Seth and..and fully realizing what you were doing then with all of us after Marengo..noon now now,just the wish that may such brisghtest sun everyday..(choke)” Seth(smile) : “Daisy,I get you,we’re more than family and has been for exactly those many years you mentioned and exactly why I could so nonchalantly swear Brock,Trace,you,Lillie,Gary and even Professor of all people and kept no contacts for 5 years knowning well it’ll take one moment to erase the 5000 years and this family is NOT DESTINY..exactly why I was so nonchallant to Brock and Trace during Pasio break as I said..I see no difference between us hence only see me that’s why..exactly why I spontaneously went into the infinity sections rather non nonchalantly Daisy had you not been my very own sister for eternity in the way I said you wouldn’t have been this happy either neither Brock,nor Trace nor would be Violet,Lillie,Gary,May,Drew,Max,Dawn,Magnus,Cilan,Harris,Tony,Olivia,Kane,Jaheem,Brenda,Flavia,Irene,Doland,Felicia,Penny,Sandra,Yumn,Virgil,Paul,Fiona,Kevin,Doris,Hamish,Lamia,my trave companion Clem at Kalos more than my bro as well he,Sabrina,none..(smile)..and neither Blasie nor Jas..none of anyone in this world has come to me for any reason rather I’ve it’s just the wordplay as I said with that language I’ve had to apply on myself for ages since I was a teenager cause of you know as they say it the despondency of being(laugh) and they only have used the more dreadful versions of this profusely on me cause of the same(laugh) and no hereby I can say if this only has proved I ever thought Mehu to be my soulmate and only her ever in my personal it’s ok but Trace knows this just doesn’t have the right words cause wasn’t concentrated enough at Ventuariastrog(laugh) the libraries and lectures in their words so maddening on the subject Soul(laugh) you have to if you have to remain sane with them sharpen yourself to the utmost to as Infie says give up this sanity to be free(laugh) no my bunch is what they are you all know pokemons are what they are they do what they do never is going to satisfy me cause I want more and hence the translators as you know Gengar they call me but Gengar is an ideal rather that I want to be so desperately but couldn’t I realized without Mehu cause we’re bounded with each other through infinity as you see and here we appear as ourselves to each other hence given our conditions of mind we have to have a relationship of spouses hence our whole being is ever shared(laugh) anyway,Gengar says what the translators do I want that if I’m you then you’re also me as would say Stashey’s Butterfree but then as my Palkia says how can I know you or you me cause where’s the difference then just what is what as says Bulby(laugh) there’s no difference just Gengar let’s tickle to be countering(laugh) the being to be the self all are mine and they me hence just be and be Gengar that is(laugh) that’s what they do in my interpretation and for me well it’s just that never liked the difference and hence about the sun Daisy your own nickname is enough a metaphor of that sun certainly to me to have someone like you as my eldest sister that’s for sure I ever knew and now know most perfectly(smile)..I’ve ever had 3 big sisters as well so much more than very own as has Stashey hence only our behaviour and it will worsen now(laughs) and yeah this I know cause I look at my bunch and listen to them realize how much they think all of you are their own as well like me and yeah well I spoke with Violet the most on Mantine(laugh) just know what she is behind the mask just like Gyarados(laugh) my bunch as you know ever will be my route to know all here cause I like it that way and so do they I guess(laugh) and that idea of their’s that they have of you more than logically ensures what you are in core and like my bros here as well without all of you neither me nor my bunch would’ve been what they are and surely not without Brock cause if I didn’t get a Dratiny who proved to be a Pangoro where would’ve I been now man where..(laughs a lot,Brock smiles broadly) and yeah Brock about your where logic is subtler than language well surely for a Gengar logic is nothing and everything if looked at from different point of views surely you will come to know in too near future(laugh) and about the whole existence being my most dear surely Daisy you are my sister there all times(smile)..and Daisy,I’m so sorry if I’ve ever hurt you and my other sisters but it’s just your little bro’s madness consider that..(laugh)well taking advantage of that surely I can heinously swear you right now and if not now then next moment and I will cause as Mehu told me you can’t surpass me if dual across eternity same for you and me sis you’re doomed to this DENTINY(laughs a lot,all broadly smiles,Daisy in tears of joy)..don’t bother Trace whole fairy bunch is there including Dreamy deployed on 70%,20% and 10% around on Daisy,Professor and Lillie and yeah Brock I believe if you were indeed logical enough would’ve realized XatuTeageist is around you dropped by the vultures none knew you first hand directly after coming hence this test they still need fastracking Unova may call anytime too much bonhomie(laughs,Brock smiles,rest smile too)..nothing is confirmed yet hence it’s ok afterall we pay an amount too for management of these too(laughs) and yeah Daisy for the bros well that word is rather diluted in constant use hence I ever say compeers lets march(laugh)..anyway,so no need for these,please take rest all of you and Daisy don’t strain yourself,please..the FUTURE is only bright by all means and they are just smiling as much as well the almost complete healthy human forms just give them a bit of break form plagiarized discourses(laugh)..and no for your clarification Mippie started with focusing upon zeal Arnie extended it to urge and then Kimmie was telling me of unbounded illusion(laughs,rest smiles)..


atleast my brats are direct these are extremely wicked just like Trace(laughs)..anyway,take rest now..but finally still sis the reason for all this and there’s no logic why my break-up was there and my behaviour and that of Mehu and all of you it’s just a damn play of people that are just each other and thus all this is to get this moment of play of coming together and then next phase of the remaining play again as Gengars(laugh) all this is to get this junction of realization of truth and happiness to be the most ENJOYING(laugh,Daisy broadly smiles,tears of joy,Tarcey and Brock also broadly smile) so yeah my Chu bro says don’t be foolish(laugh) you’re my very own big sis as ever(smile)..”
Daisy(smile,tears of joy,shivering voice) : “um..thanks Seth..I get you bro and your bunch finally in full after all these years(tears of joy,beams,Tracey broadly smiles)..just tell Mehu that..(tears of joy,chokes)..and those at Unova..(profuse tears of joy)..anyway..bye”
Tracey(smile) : “Brock man you started it just like the career of this little brat(Seth laughs) so you go till the end,I’ll not hear a thing more,and Seth,um..anyhow,just come today sometimes and forget that Unova totally the general government is chosen not to sit around in bushes just that(Seth laughs a lot)..bye..”
Seth(laugh) : “sweet sweet Trace..and Brock with respect to the text that have got you WOKEN(laugh) did you get what I just s..”
Brock(smile) : “Seth,enough.I’m woken enough with the sinisters finally visible just as i asked them with much calmness and let me see after yesterday still my Viol is surrounded by 9 psychic dragons tendering her and her future taking their ages to be same this itself is enough(smile,Seth laughs shaking his head)..(laughs)..hang on DaisyDevil doesn't leave unfinished businesses(both burst..).."
Tracey+Daisy(reconnects,laughs) : "nor do the feeling crooks say my this(all laugh..lot,Brock shakes..lot).."
Seth(laughing..) : "what was the innuendos like compeer at seniority#.."
Yerkebuian=Seniority-off-Block=Temporal-alas-Shock : "centuries ago compeers just in case it can start#..i was going through many facets many causal chains and i thought what if i was the ruler,Knower,MASTER..of these exactly then compeers i met many beings who were in difficulties of many definitions..shh..so much combinatorics#..then many were opposed to them many for many manipulating them and all were going compeers going to be..shh..that pervading's..shh..situation#..then few helped few few turned few to own systems and compassion and dissolutions compeer no ego only another oh shadow why bother..the most centered..shh..Lantern said Shadow look relation..shh..so environmental#..so i asked them is solution alone compeers is me a mere prone..the most i said intriguing own#..they said you see enumeration#..when you want something you will get it's definition..any logic diluted as suspicion#..then i thought ok just as i did i realized me compeers..clickbait gone as any..shh..so much another..other's many#.."


..it’s ok they were told to behave I guess is absolutely seething so I better prolong the most enjoying(both laugh)..I’ve travelled the world with you for 8 long years yeah mentally(laughs,Seth laughs shaking his head)..I knew you to be mischievous but only with YOUR Mehadi all time though intellectually(Seth laughs) with us you were the most cunning and irritating little brat(both laugh) and Daisy can bless herself that the whole break still wasn’t revisited(laughs,Seth laughs shaking his head)..and about you being a cunning pro well your Gyarados was no better then in the first two regions atleast later got much cosmeticed during Johto itself and then gradually went to the academics(both laugh) and you were serious like you were just now only if we pushed you too much in those feelings(both laugh) and that’s almost totally Trace that is(both laugh),man you just brushed aside 5 years like a twig from your path,surely that language counters the theoretical monotony of infinity exactly what these two are getting prepared to disprove to give sounder logic(both laugh) just like your Gengy(all laugh)..indeed they don’t seem tired or in discomfort now just irritated(both laugh) so yeah I understand Mehadi’s horrendous idealism embodied once more across planes(both laugh)..and well I only wish Team Rocket didn’t enter your language that’s all(both laugh,Seth shakes his head laughing)..surely now I understand fully what means becoming tickling self rather than the one being tickled(both laugh),I’m too busy now a days with your vulture business(both laugh),but you two are welcome anytime and come together only,what else to say..”
Seth(smile) : “before everything at first is that you have only 2 monre months left to vulture business after that I’ll see how a crook like you can stay away from beings that he has known for 8 years on hand(both laugh) and thus the subsequent absences are just a matter of artistry in excuses(both laugh) cause you see Doctor Slate not for nothing does the outside profession in complete whole of a whole region named Kalos is infatuated with me(both laugh) so OAK LAB SUPREME EXTENSION HURDLES HAS BECOME SO NAIVE(both laugh),now first(both laugh) you must absolutely have eternity no not finish this call(both laugh) and I’ll swear off any vulture anywhere cause of my REACH(both laugh) and finances surely you know the gatefees thus you may understand by virtue of being a fully professional practicing crook(both laugh) that I’M RICH(both laugh) so that is a weapon Brock an all weather damn weapon(both laugh) and all this comes to be full only now cause finally now I’m fully Mehadivious(both laugh,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly smiling with little tears,Seth tenders her) and second that you’re as usual just so naive(both laugh) and don’t be naive in thinking that because I’ve got now 322 including Mime,Chu of all will suddenly turn on you or Trace or your soulmates of all people just if so tell him and you know too well Crawdauntogator(both laugh) but note that Gary isn’t included cause Tyranitar doesn’t obey(both laugh) Yveltal and Madgaleo as well(both laugh) or Guzzy that is(both laugh) just that what they show the world is because they can independently do their jobs and thus they scoff at me saying you’re the idiotic clueless look-only-at first this is the sweet cute idiot(both laugh,Mehadi in tears of joy smiles at Seth  im very firmly and Seth tenders her) as exactly said as soon as I said that if you have a beau as you’re saying then why are you here without the police(both laugh) and that was it(both laugh) before that called my mom to know my whereabouts calling her mom(both laugh) same bug as ever no matter the gym leading cosmetics(both laugh,Seth pats Mehadi’s cheeks,Mehadi smiles  oy very firmly) and ATTITUDE(both laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth) so was ever and if ever any doubts that I had realized that to show whom what the brats were used in which way like in Pasio(both laugh) though that certain who was nowhere around(both laugh) was going like you’ve cheated and all I get a little stern say how do I know you being a star didn’t do the same on me given the few brats and namecalled her profusely(laugh) no logic nothing was there just the wordplay and her condition wasn’t good you know using () for a few months cause I was appearnig in dreams so the psychic healing went on simultaneously 7 hours the 132 brats used there with Bulby as doctor and Whimie and Baylie as assistant nothing has happened to them at all as they’ve been WOKEN(laugh) the less confining would ever win(laugh,Brock boradly smiles) just my GENGLEYE(laugh) then dragon tarvel after proposal at Henry care Marengo knew many there via Sabrina and all after undercover all fine and herself was just saying why are you appearing in my dreams I want to marry you but leave me(laugh,Brock smiles) just my sweetly ponytailed Gyaradosy Mehu flower(smiles at Mehadi  er very firmly,Mehadi also smiles at Seth  im very firmly with still a little tears,Brock broadly smiles) so no matter was anything and besides the few men that were there in HQ are my fans now cause I politely send them back to home from a place which they never gave a thought of travelling before and then there I won 250 hall of fame gym badges with 72 competitions having brought 15 dragons and 4 ghosts such as Hoopa,Confragigus,Chaneldure and Aegislash(both laugh) and also yeah a MELOETTA(both laugh) to make it 20 the round figure is just so MADDENING(both laugh) and yeah those men as I like to call them not by name but in plural cause that language counters the hidden distaste of indellible events for all parties and hence the language(both laugh) and they said in 10 scale of time permitted you were the discussion of topic from Yellowburst to confession to
how sweet you and Glalie were for 9(both laugh)..later when still Seth wasn’t calling Seth from my own phone(both laugh) was made 7 out of 10 rest two just your distance calculation with the current respect(both laugh,pats Mehadi’s cheeks again laughing,Mehadi same pose smiles at Seth)..and the diaries a few I saw stole that is(both laugh)..all had like,huh we’re done but um..why are we both single(all laugh)..those brats just a moment of madness totally cured as 3 time champs would be as you know the reason for being the 3 time champ I’ve been later made aware of the school days(both laugh) and Salamences(both laugh) and the confidence levels were there cause Cobalions defeated of all a few Solgaleos to break dreams of 5 times champs in 8th regions(both burst into laughter) had a prolonged chat with the men in their offices at Lumburg Pasio HQ too fond of me now desperately wants to make themselves alongside newly realized soulmates like me that is the philosophy of being a Gengar(both burst into laughter) Gengarian philosophy has caught them and I fuelled it to absolute maxima(both laugh) really some brats those are(all laugh) finally told all family drama we were sent to check on you as pawns cause Daisy flower and Lillie flower and of course Viol flower likes to keep certain men hanging(both laugh) well Viol flower sure was being hung rather that is(both laugh) anyway,thus they weren’t happy that being their protegree how can the baby flower become a Gyarados and devour me at the first sight itself totally bilndly(both laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth  im firmly,Seth keeps tendering her)..thus they were just pawns and so happy to be have resigned from the drama company(both burst into laughter)..really those brats made my day that day trying to be Gengar and all cause soulmates aren’t listening to too frank Gengars(both laughter)..what brats they are man be prepared(both laugh)..and our Gyaradosy young Mehu flower doesn’t know one thing except Seth so all the rest were just that why is Seth not fondling me still as much as he should(both laugh,Seth smiles at Mehadi,Mehadi smiles at Seth  im very firmly) young flower my dream um..no no daydream(both laugh,Mehadi hides her face in Seth’s chest smiling  im very firmly,Seth keeps tendering her) same sweetly ponytailed Gyaradosy Mehu bug nothing changes and you see Brock all my stuffs were to prove to myself that I can stay single and the life of a pokemon named Gengar(both laugh) which beautiful men at Pasio HQ is obsessed with as life philosophy(both burst into laughter) may the infinite compassion help them(both laugh) so I wanted to be like my Gengar- totally carefree as to any sort of personal relationship cause I don’t care about anyone and the things I told you are my views on opposite gender if they pester me(both laugh) Unovan Madgaleo directed by the great Tyranitar(both laugh) and supported by the drak marchant Yveltal(both laugh) and of course GROUDON(both laugh) as you know a bit from me then was all about me letting them think independently started by Feraligator supported by Chu that I need to be taught a lesson that the sweet cute idiot needs to be commanded(both laugh) absolutely same view no difference and that’s why I had to delete the whole world off from my head to appease the brats with new dragons who are utmost brats themselves(both laugh) you sure know what my bunch does and talks a bit and sure Noivern who was thrown out as leader of group cause breeding season skirmishes are AH!don’t disturb them or me it’s just that blooming youth(both burst into laughter)..so you can understand they are like humans with limitations thus totally free of myself just that bond so deepened made tham this along with who they are in-bron like Muk and Snorlax(both laugh) and the rest I guess you know surely some bits about my bunch in terms of how powerful they are like Chu,Luxray and Zekrom are 3 max normal mad Lightenthunstrom and the intelligence level is nowhere near that name as you know(both laugh) and still Zekrom is Lightenthunstrom normal mad max+4(both laugh),and I’ve got GitiLatiUltraCozy(both laugh),Giratina and Latios is Ghostradarkarrigussonor mad max+1 and Ultranercozma can go one step more(both laugh) and you know these all are nothing to them as BEAUTY(both laugh,pats Mehadi’s cheeks,Mehadi smiles at Seth) cause they’ve got WOKEN(both laugh) as HUMAN(both laugh) surely that dumb jackal wasted Daisy’s 2 years atleast hence this rage(both laugh) and our Lillie flower and Daisy flower increased their fondling rate directed at my bunch as the anger increased(both laugh) just the family as well man,all of you and I know too much of my Mantine-sis(both laugh) and of all people surely you came with me for no reason but I dragged you to be that pokemon(both laugh) and Trace is just our eternal butler(both laugh) I was obsessed with that beautiful hell to make it most comfortable for me to share with my flower who thought the trouble arouse all cause the ponytail wasn’t there on the break-up day(both laugh)..it’s just an illusion Brock nothing else we’re no normal family and you don’t need anything to understand what my feelings and and why they are so cause it’s that FEELING(both laugh) but Brock I’m proud of myself that that day I roasted a truest damn brat despite you(both laugh) in fact it was at them sorry for the mix up but you know whom I manage or rather the viseversa actually(both laugh) but surely that private thing didn’t go out cause of that exact language(both laugh) and your passage was safe cause that brat realized if 12 year close friends can do that and yeah whole world knew the friend cause neither he nor his brats were exactly sane for anyone’s comfort across regions and professions and lives that is(both laugh) so considering his position and reach and fame and all then looking at this exasparation imagine what the man did to him(both laugh) and don’t dare to call me your friend or bro cause I’m the compeer(both laugh) Dawn was 17 when she namecalled you being 35(both laugh) just so naive(both laugh) and as I said learnt about her infoes as you know better than me the beau is nice Mr Magnus the SteadyFox Glenol(both laugh) atleast lady Dawn has become the sweet little baby Dawnny that she actually is finally(both laugh) but I thus can finally be the Gengar that I couldn’t before cause I didn’t have my soulmate with me then but Mehudos as a Mehugar..(both laugh)and whole accident was accident and the wisdom merchants got it horribly wrong as you see cause they expected bribes as usual to fight truly like Steelix does now(both laugh) and the letter just the whole watered rock family love them(both laugh) and Brock to be honest even if that was true Violet is what she is and the rest you know best so it’s just that I’m overjoyed for both of you as you are both always SENSEI(both laugh) so I won’t ask for forgivance cause you’re with your soulmate first second you’re quote full time practising professional pokemon poacher(both laugh) and I eavesdropped you to know your career and what you are at which position by means of REACH(both laugh) a returned favour(both laugh) and I ever knew you’re a great person when it comes to the point that with them you must be naive(both laugh)..no way you’re family to me man no way(both laugh)..Unovan namecalled incident created a confusion in me that if a brat is infatuated enough to first humiliate herself in public that she’ll regret as she becomes a wife if she is honest which is the doubt(both laugh) then why is my flower so much infatuated with me to the point that young flower dream is ever brushed aside no matter the implications that I had to hear for ages and now that because a picture comes and I don’t contact means 15 years gone to bay then I must immediately propose her(both laugh) turned down cause how can Seth say that Mehu isn’t the only one that can mind the words BOOK him as a COACH(both laugh,pats Mehadi’s head,Mehadi same pose smiles at Seth) herself was too strained as as I told you all today just wanted to have a family with me cause the time was right but the trouble was that it was not at all so in the scale of KOMMO-O(both laugh) and I was naive(both laugh) then 5 years and undercover then a sudden realiztion was enough and I feel so horrible that my flower had to endure so much pain so yeah infatuated so much as ever as to forget that I am a boy and she is a girl thus the ever proximity that the literal is never enough to give(both laugh) and thus I was told to give a ring and go back to the so and so if I didn’t say that she’s Mehu(both laugh) the ring is Seth why he wasn’t there after Sinnoh even if a false ring(both laugh) cause Seth only I now can book all I want cause he’s only Seth you namecalls(both laugh) during the date not one word as to my motives or her activities you namecall you’re never a playboy cause you’re only Mehadi’s boy(both laugh) only mine you are you stupid idiot you’re only Seth(both laugh) and you’re doomed to this inevitibity in every life so WALK BEHIND ME(both laugh,Mehadi smiles  oy very firmly,Seth tenders her) even after proposal I said you thought I’ve a new girlfriend I can’t have,SHUT UP!why are you talking about girls(both laugh) just that same 17 year old bugged-flower that wanted me to walk behind her(both laugh) and now I should be carrying her on my arms no matter the cosmetics(both laugh)..a hall of fame gym leader with worldwide name and all,all illusion the reality is this sweet cute Seth I’m Gyaradosy-Mehu(both laugh)..and you know exactly why these personal romance tales of ours are so sweetly universal being of long long time too happily married couple sweetness that has ever eluded language of subtlity(both laugh,Seth laughs at Mehadi who smiles at him same pose) marriage at first sight you know a bit intriguing at 17(both laugh) which you should’ve acknowledged man you two were fully practising professional philophical crooks in their 20s for God’s sake(both laugh) and as for me I know the discourse was enough for our DaisyDevil of all flowers(both laugh) as you know dealing with university dropout Muking jackals ain’t easy at all(both laugh) yeah been to Venturiastrog as I said for lectures on SOUL(both laugh) hence the language and I call it the ELOQUENCE(both laugh) but still if it was ONLY CAUSE I’m experienced(both laugh) still just to end that I can’t see a girl as notMehu(both laugh) you know that most(both laugh) so notMehu became onlyFlesh(both laugh) and besides you’ll surely know that I have total 84 psychics including Sharpedo and 27 ghosts cause mind the tense of your knowledge(both laugh) and I roam around with Ultranercozma and/or Giratina(both laugh) or Gengar and Sableye(both laugh) and Dusknoir,Darkrai,Malamar,Deoxys,Cresselia as new imports(both laugh) or Rayquaza and Mismagius or Rotom and so on so on so on of course(both laugh) sorry to disturb your Viol flower then and then and now(both laugh) but then you should’ve asked me the right calling schedule at first then(both laugh) at second she should’ve been gaged only(both laugh) and at third all what I did since day one being born that is surely you know my Solgaleo,Celebi and Kyurem via textbooks(both laugh and Brock says,”to my utmost misfortune having seen the first two and to increase that will now be the last who to make matters worse is a damn dragon(both laugh even more”) thus since day one what I’m doing is what was said by my Gengy(both laugh) in undercover before final in the plan all is done with all and Crawdauntogator who said we must not hinder ourselves tomorrow by thinking we exist(both laugh) and so Gengy concludes for them and me too that whatever you are to get to relaity is what you should do as I just did is to,LET’S TICKLE to be COUNTERING(both uncontrollably laugh,Mehadi also laughs  oy) just my Gengy(both laugh) but the Mantinal songs meant if you can be a naively crooked philosopher I TOO AM AN EARNING AND WORKING PERSONALLY INDEPENDET PROFESSIONAL WOMAN MANTINE(both burst into laughter) nothing more ever knew all of us she is just too sweet too liitle too much Mantinelet(both laugh) and you know that she knows only about Mantine but more than any Mantine himself knows(both laugh) and I had extracted that knowledge ages ago in Sinnoh no matter the namecalls in betwwen the swings of greatest caring husband and biggest infatuated brat(both laugh) I’m only happy for all of you and happy for myself that I’ve had a family since day one 22 years back that’s all that’s not a family cause I am compared to Gengar hence I tickle(both laugh)..but enough with trash talks can I get your dishes again(both laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “ONLY IF you came together with your so many cute cute girls isn’t it I LOOK WAY BETTER THAN THOSE NAMECALLS ALL COMBINED(both laugh,Mehadi smiles and blushes a little  oy firmly) but come prepared to be swallowed up by Violovious(both laugh)..but just a thing Seth,Unovan legends bit too greedy for even tonight aren’t they?...” Seth(laugh) : “huge story Brock all in good times,and yeah twice I was wanted but both times real gym leaders whom I know there like Mrs Olympia Sydons from Opastrakar,Unova hall of fame psychic gym I guess we all know about her and she is in good contacts told me that situation unless something God forbid most serious happens to someone very close to you there and many are they know at 250 and 72(both laugh) then just don’t come and the famous pseudo-legend gym at Nacrene City,Unova with Mrs Lily Taubert Jolum as leader I have a very warm relationship with her like mom and son same attitude you surely know her whole world does cause she is also in trainer’s hall of fame at 6,5(both laugh) and she also said don’t come at all unless too serious and personal,40 rare legends been found general govt war issue including Pasio and Kalos who are as usual playing their games cause they are as much greedy as the legends are barring Percy,Kalos head I know him very well in person and whole world does as professional legend but he’s this time against money of all opponents and we all know the obligations already affects his performances severely just a madcap passionate battler too sweet for that post sadly(both laugh) but thankfully cause one Lance is enough for anything beyond(both laugh) just had to tell Mehu that even today there’s no respite for me and I just hope nothing happens and they call the govt in which Unova being run by 5 man committee is a bit hard thing to do(both laugh)..anyway,just relax for next 14 days atleast I’m not going anywhere cause I should be atleast for 5/6 days be all alone lost in Mehu(both laugh)..shouldn’t I be alone thus Brock hence not lone(both laugh)..” Brock(laugh) : “yeah but don’t be with grand philosopher herself cause she is a goddamn 25 feet 6110 kg dragon(all laugh),but with her human formed condensed soulmate of yours in front of you only at your own home nowhere else(both laugh)..forget damn brats jumping up and down there normally can’t win 1 aiming for 222 with legends which still might’ve happened had they had the remote brains to not proceed without your Cili(both laugh) just let the govt kill each brat together with their beaus and theirs too bringing each together(both laugh)and yeah be prepared to confess your longing to your beau to 1000 other people who will be soon at your room calling(both laugh) except your big sis of course(both laugh) must’ve ended her morning contemplation now(both laugh) but the little version isn’t cause that includes the costly lines mind that(both laugh) to spew(both laugh) surely your eternal sis now will devour you up soon as well and her eternal spew will wisely lecture but precisely and eloquently so cause he’s CULTURED(both laugh) bye and morning(both laugh)..which feeling is just so naive(both burst into laughter)..” Seth(laugh) : “yeah namecalling(both burst into laughter) but you crook immediately finish calling my lillte sis for her to Drew sweetly said please dear you can SPEW(both burst into laughter)..INFATUATION hum INFATUATION,I WILL CLEAR HER VOMIT BY MY OWN HANDS SENDING YOU THE REAL TIMES(both burst into laughter)..man haven’t seen my sweet little bro-in-law with my sweetest little sis physically for 11 years now you know the luck of being a general trainer countering(both laugh) and then they were 21 now 32,whole 20s passed even the early 30s too(both laugh) and they are expecting their future now then only just about confessed being sane non vomitting couples(both laugh) yeah Drew himself told me had to call after the break-in news erupted via Tony boy(both laugh) those infatuated brats and the psycho will be dealt later MANUALLY(all laugh) thus I give you no minutes to control your naivety and theirs(both laugh) else I’ll tell them that proposal was copied from you(both laugh) and yeah lastly man once more cause I’m a Gengar that surely you came to me for the only reason that I demanded to know which pokemon you are(both laugh) and Trace is just the butler(both laugh),both my sisters are just my sisters as is my little sister’s littler bro that pest Max whose no more so little of course(both laugh) but then again there was lady Dawn who came cause well(both laugh) we actually went with her to tackle the pan Sinnoh males and obviously females excluding her including her mom(both laugh) just the chatter to scoff at you telling Mehu that,only you like me Mehu these namecalls..(both laugh) cause there wasn’t any reason really for this whole drama cause it’s just a play man it happens for the same reason why we’re family and Mehu and me are soulmates as is you and your Viol flower but Violet is only expressive always at tea ONLY(both laugh) but if you utter the word destiny again you’ll get GitiCozy(both laugh) or if you don’t that is for sure ofcourse(both laugh) man too happy don’t want this call to end thus Morning Brockoli.Bye(both laugh and Brock reciprocates saying “naively till next minute only”,both laugh and bye)..” Mehadi(smile,tears, oy) :”What is this Seth?” Seth(bursts into laughter) : “Greninja’s Kalos Wisdom:Chapter 22:Senor in Hellrounds(laughs uncontrollably,Mehadi keeps looking at Seth and smiles)..but really Mehu how can you be so sure that she’s not studying these right now(bursts into laughter,Mehadi same pose,very little tears)..” Mehadi(wipes tears off, oy very firmly,smile) : “Seth don’t leave without me..” Seth(smile,cover Mehadi’s mouth with him palm and hugs her very firmly)

illegally(laugh,Mehadi smiles same pose)..my sweet flower was so sweetly sleeping in her sweet bed as usual turning on the left side cause Seth always wanted me to sleep turning on the right(laugh,Mehadi smiles both same pose)..then my Sableye woke her up and she so sweetly rubbed her eyes then looked at me was shocked but before that Sableye made sure she can’t talk(laugh,Mehadi same pose smiles)..so I gagged her(laugh) then bind her by rubber tapes(laugh)..then put her on my laps and she was so sweetly sitting on my lap without any thoughts just enjoying the proximity of her

make you happy just being who you are is to be happy(both laugh) like searching for a beau so hard so why not be the beau to be happy(both burst into laughter) once you don’t understand what happiness is you’re just happy(both laugh)..in pursuit of happiness this brat and Tyrangaleo(both laugh)..
Mehadi(laugh,same pose) : “really Seth,these brats can’t be replaced in 2000 years(both laugh) I saw your your Kalos final and those two brats Gengar and Noivern and today your Gengleye tickled both me to death(both laugh) and Chu said like why should we be in pokeballs only serious people go there(both burst into laughter)..like(laugh) the young one(both uncontrollably laugh,tears)..man poor Margin is just bashed left and right always(both laugh) so the two ghostly pests are roaming around the whole house and outside(both laugh)..(smile,looking at Seth)..after I saw that final and read those reports as I said, I just thought I had lost my sweet Seth cause he and his bunch seemed so far away from me(Seth smiles at Mehadi and keeps tendering and  er,Mehadi broad smile,same pose)..but now I know it’s just me(both looking at each other smiles,ach other,then they keep ach other very firmly for a few more moments)...but Seth is that farm..”

Mehadi(smiles at Seth then keeps her head on Seth’s chest,same pose,Seth smiles at her then same pose) : “I’m sorry but no Seth I can’t quite recall I wasn’t alright then even turned down any approach to have professional contacts I was just in a shell then my bunch was good and subsequently my skill somehow got that tag and then the Frontier Symbol increased the time from 8:30-19:00 told Lance it’s ok I can manage have been for 1.75 years I just didn’t know where I was unless my bunch atleast I knew could forget you for some moments cause I thought of your bunch and Glalie so much it shifted my focus but then going back again the same..you’ve been well without me Seth atleast outside I know your pain that you each moment felt but still you weren’t alone with your bunch and so on but for me there’s nothing really nothing not even my bunch that much no I can’t and won’t let them off but not as much attached as you are as you said I’ve truly none as much as close to my heart as you I’ve my bunch my family such great but Seth is just me I just want you Seth all the time with me,since the day I first saw Seth me in another form that’s Seth I want Seth,only Seth,just Seth(smiles at Seth,with tears,Seth smiles at her and wipes off her tears then as well both in same pose)..” Seth(smile,same pose) : “sweetie you’re Mehu Ketchum now hum officially and formally that will be with you this life and so will be me any beyond hum(smiles at Mehadi,Mehadi smiles at Seth still little tears same pose,Seth wipes them off)..Mehu dear,please we married today it’s our first night just forget what can happen in future and no you won’t leave me if you so want dear,please now you were so happy a few moments ago(laugh) Giratina hum(smiles at Mehadi,Mehadi smiles at Seth the both same pose)..sweet Mehu flower..(both continues the same pose looking at each other..)..” (call comes May and Drew,Seth shows that and broadly smiles,Mehadi too smiles) Seth(smile) : “Mrs May Maple Blackmore,4 time conference winner Kanto,Unova,Pasio and Sinnoh last 3 of which all drawn with your now husband Mr Drew Blackmore,currently that abstract bond has decided to call upon a being or more who are insterested to take you as co-ordinators to get their journey as humans started and with that let the future begin..so how’s my sweetest little sis ?..” May(tears of joy,shivering voice) : “bro,you..I’m just so happy that you’re back and..” Seth(smile) : “the second that is ideas are bigger than persons and ever beyond all temporal barriers- ever your bro ever my sweetest sweet little sis the rest is long story but my little doll all later now talk with your sis-in-law Mehu minus Y(laugh,all else smile)..” May(tears of joy) : “um..yeah..”
Mehadi(smile) : “hi May,Mehu Ketchum talking(broadly smiles)..” May(broad smile,still little tears,shivering voice) : “hi Mehadi,congrats..23 years now formal finally..congrats to you two but that’s just words I’m overjoyed..Brock informed..so happy for both you..it’s just..(chokes in joy,smiles at Drew,Drew tenders her smiling)..” Mehadi(smile) : “same here May I’ve got Seth with me now that’s all my life and just heard about you and Drew,congrats for the bright future and the gems you two will reveal to us and all(both broadly smiles)..so how are you..” May(smile) : “I’m fine..Drew too..just got the news 5 days ago he told bro then..we all knew that bro challenged you in a match there and all and then did what he does got the news through Tony all knew it’s just to get you we ever thought ego has got him I couldn’t come into terms with myself that after 14 years how could I lose my big bro like this to ego he was just harsh on me on my anniversary in a manner that just got all of us here totally dubmstruck you know I just felt as if the earth was no more under my feet I’ve always traveled with my family throughout me career but well Drew and me in a way knew each other for 5 years no matter our relationship before we started out together but bro came up at Hoenn and for 5 years I never felt I wasn’t with my mom and dad all time(smiles  rew,Drew smiles and tenders her,Mehadi smiles  oy firmly,Seth smiles and keeps tendering Mehadi)..infact they would’ve given me all the care and attendence but surely couldn’t impart such knowledge in such a way..and Drew too was extremely surprized cause he ever has had his big bro as well..(all smile)..but now we relaize hardly can be sane without you,ego never got to him it was his own confusion and his level of attainment all combined had to return my bro is ever the winner countered everything no matter what I remember so many things from when I had the opportunity to travel with him all alone for 7 months and those parts really propelled me to places that would’ve taken may be my whole life to get to..those days I can’t forget and recall so many of the counters..ever topped himself no matter what this time too(shivering voice,smiles at Drew,Drew smiles at May both hug each other,Mehadi smiles at Seth  im,Seth too hugs Mehadi smiling)..” Mehadi(smile) : “yeah May you’ve got your bro back all here their bro as well Tracey,Brock,Gary all and everyone has got him back in a much much better form only and I’ve got Seth back with me and he’s so much changed now that has become so much more sweet than ever you’ll all see with time soon I’m just overjoyed.no as you understand never forgot any of us just confusion and all and his level changes affected his personal life and you know as well as anyone that the press never is kind to any who are a bit different no matter how good and honest but all are done only better days ahead..” May(smile) : “that’s for sure Mehadi once more congrats and officially then you’re my sis-in-law(all smile)..” Mehadi(smile) : “yeah sis definitely I’ve got someone younger finally as well in family(all smile)..but how are all uncle and aunty,my sweet little bro all of them..” May(smile) : “yeah all fine but well Max isn’t little exactly anymore as has a girlfriend now named Vidonia whose of legal age(both laugh) same profession normal specialist breeder implying the fights(both laugh) doing the travels only coming down here in short spans by every means(all laugh),mom dad fine very fine we are all fine and happy with everything just that bro wasn’t there so no matter something was missing now it’s just heaven(smile,Mehadi and Drew smile too,Seth smiles too) but anyway Mehadi first how are you we know you weren’t right by any means and we all just knew the reason but just couldn’t do anything and that was just so devastating but we understand that you being married to bro now that must be long gone already given you but still how’s health now..” Mehadi(smile) : “no May,I’m ok just severe depression and the psychic types and the rest you understand but all behind me now Seth himself took me to the best doctor at Marengo itself the dragon subtle travel right after the proposal and I’m fine just mental strains and pain was too much and the gym itself became a trouble hall of fame and more pressure with that Frucifern and all you know neither my profession in pokemon world nor out of it has been kind to me at all except my dear bunch and all I just lost my head for a moment but really it’s all ok now personally with me and you know it was just my marriage that I wanted and have now finally and with his postion now supplimented by name and reach and his familiarity to Lance the Elite4 head in a very close personal form here only but he virtually you know is just may be the very last say in everything throughout every little section of our profession now given his current position so all Elite4s are actually managable and he will get the hazards fixed no worries for me at all I’m fine and so are all at lab just Seth was missing now back and more than made up the absense in just a day so yeah May heaven indeed(smiles  oy firmly,May and Drew too broadly smiles,Seth smiles at Mehadi tendering her) and how’s your bunch and how’s Drew..” May(smile) : “well relieved we are to know you’re fine and healthy enjoy your time now with bro and yeah we’re fine the bunch is ever the same in pursuit to insanity(both laugh)..calmed down a bit now after 2 regions without dragons excluding them ofcourse(all laugh)..Drew,Me both fine no troubles and his bunch is actually something I can’t tell you much about due to marital jealousy(both laugh) and here’s he(both laugh)..” Drew(smile) : “hi Mehadi!congrats!”
Mehadi(smile) : “hi Drew! And yeah thanks and congrats to you too on your future..(both laugh)..” Drew(smile) : “yeah,thanks but this would be so dear to us despite the jealousy that is(both laugh) but that is only one part of family,Seth and you another(all smile) both here now so happy I’m and all are here(all smile) I called him after coming to know of his match at Cerulean from Olivia asked Zed about it said he had a match and all we both thought it was all just to get you out of that uncomfortable situation with all that was happening and just wants to marry you that’s why he was doing all that and Tony as you know wasn’t all happy about his endeavours but after this match and subsequent break-in that I came to know too he also realized it’s just that the reality is the reality and hence both he and Oliv were just waiting for you two to get married and I came to know these from them and agreed to them so told about us and our future and all then Brock called with his discourse excerpt as well(smiles,May smiles,Mehadi smiles looking at Seth and Seth laughs) always knew only showed the oblivious side was as deep thinking as anyone infact I thought of calling him after that misunderstanding with May and no given the family knew the unfortunate incidents too but then I wasn’t sure given his bunch it may push him much I thought so desisted..but I asked Zed about Bosangria and he confirmed what Seth was doing there for 3 long years and thus given my personal experiences with him,I knew what sort of thought process is needed to get to that(Seth laughs,rest smile) and thus his skills and ideas all did become clear in a way to me thus I was all the more afraid to disturb him cause as May said would never stop if he feels he’s being bogged down by himself..and yeah his reach well reaches to contests as well by every means you know none else could’ve pushed me atleast to a title at second region like that that too with 6 months less travel(smiles,Seth laughs saying,none can win it no matter the push unless he is a bit shrew,Drew and May both smile,Mehadi too smiles)..yeah generational progress your words(both and May laugh,Mehadi smiles)..and about it Mehadi I just felt bad with those things there but couldn’t help we just had to go out to Johto as we knew it so both me and May actually were just in much pain then again Zed came to help as usual but still we just had that bit of pain in our minds seeing the illusion there you know but given Seth now that’s no more there and currently we’re at Daristurm came 2 days ago for a celebration was thinking of may be settling down here though but now we surely will want to nest right down there at Cerulean and nowhere else personally or professionally Seth notwithstandig your sister’s state of mind I’m off in December and from tomorrow itself she’s all yours to look after not me finally countering(laughs,May smiles  rew,Mehadi and Seth both broadly smiles)..so this is to just erase that illusive inconvenience off as Brock said at infinity subtlity of language may hold never beyond(smiles,May and Mehadi smiles,Seth laughs saying Kalos University plagarized)..yeah atleast you decided to get civilized rhyming(all laugh) that is something else surely if it has made Brock of all people too thoughtful even after 45 years of familiarity(all laugh) so yeah as you said Mehadi with that we understand too Seth is just back in much better form that is easier to comprehend(all laugh) we all are so happy really and meeting as soon as possible with all possible discussions of residence(all smile)..” Mehadi(smile) : “sure Drew meeting as soon as possible and yeah whole 11 city circle is just too devoted to us as you know(all laugh) so you’re more than welcome comprehensible that is(all laugh)..Seth will surely make up the years and give way more looking forward and here’s he...” Seth(laugh) : “but don’t spoil your preparations with dragons you know they will be the real parents that’s why(all laugh) and well look I could’ve said Mr Drew Blackmore,how are you but I guess that’s rather incomprehensible compared to what surely I was doing mentally at Bosangria that is do I have to confess my longing for you(laugh,Drew smiles,Mehadi smiles,May broadly smiles  rew)..” Drew(smile) : “yeah sure bro but I just hope for role reversals next term with Zed on my side(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “or the young ones(all laugh)..well I would be too overjoyed to get Absol at 3rd and Flygon of all pseudo-legendary dragonic meances at 4th first region cause the names tickle(all laugh)..but my flower atleast never foisted her biased opinions upon me vehemently(all laugh)..no man I knew the preparations in details cause was consulted(all laugh) hence understood your conditions thus indeed was insulted(all laugh)..and no it was Zed infact who spoiled both me and Gary as you know day 1 told us both first words KOMMO-O(all laugh)..anyway man sorry that Brock in too much excitement couldn’t wait 4 more hours anyway doesn’t matter really I want to know how are you and my sis on the sectors – hall of fame,accusitions,preparations and the CULTURAL environment provided to the respective bunches on the whole in the mixed zone(laugh,Drew as well laughs)..” Drew(smile) : “all are absolutely brilliant by all means including EDUCATION for the brats(both laugh) well afterall we spent 2.5 years at Kalos of all places topping it off with a draw having travelled the region just after confessing,then drew at Unova and married right after then went to Sinnoh and drew again then finally at Johto settled down so yeah chronological stuff(all laugh)..and no for me now just 3 years off then will do the last one and see if my whole bunch can join your brats’ league too(all laugh) but May is officially retired now so afterall I win you see remembering my name(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “yeah indeed(all laugh)..but May I know today isn’t the right occasion but you’re in a direct communion now with beings that is yet to form psychophysically so there’s anyway psychophysical tuning needed are you all alright dear regarding the career decision that it’s only disinterest..” May(smile) : “yes bro it’s just disinterest nothing more..I’ve never felt better psychophysically it’s not a problem there but you know it will be just too far a step for me with my mindset and views to be travelling 3.5 more years without my little dolls one and two is as I said for this term I would rather like to stay firmly centred within my beloved ones and not go out of it to get more of them with me rather wait for them and pester them(all smile)..” Seth(smile) : “I see as you wish my sweet doll sister-pester indeed(all laugh)..but Mr Blackmore are you sure you can travel ALONE(all laugh)” Drew(laugh) : “well it’s a matter of legends now(all laugh),so yeah hall of fame by all means with more accusions of being flukes and biased(all laugh) hence totally immune even at Cerulean with all sorts of contradictions exactly your favourite playing ground(all laugh) and you two being here among us serves the cherry on top as much does the future stay at Cerulean so double dilight for us making it triple as you’re Mehadi too and viseversa(smiles,Seth laugh)..” Seth(smile) : “just came off that stuff Kalos had 3 University lectures on soul never as precise as you though(both laugh) abstruse philosophical topics to the utmost now rather than sporadic that had been the case from 13-33(all laugh) and you must know my bunch’s antics long story in one words no wish to battle either me or my bunch and they can work independently using their brains bossing me around somehow that love for me so deepend now has become my siblings and thus their own natural nature of not knowing what a battle is is reflecting but they have much control over that being with me thus the antics wants to make friends with the whole world like Team Rocket’s greatest boss(laughs,Drew smile)..started at Kalos as you know but I wasn’t clear myself as to what they were doing just realized too playful now after all those mental battles at Unova and that was at it’s beginning in Kalos that now too tried and too much knowledge about themselves doesn’t fear the inevitable and eventual anymore and hence independent fully that they were partially at Sinnoh final so now will roam around with me but as my siblings and thus I was somewhere else in my mind never knew where I was all the communications and advises you so many times told me to keep grounded ever helped those but for just that day to next was floating around in mind you know what all these means in nerveous channels that suddenly your bunch is doing all these and thus then had to have all possible foods to keep myself sane and grounded and them as well ate any philosophical food for deep thinking to sharpen myself up to understand more about everything and you know the same things I read at may be 4 always speak the truth same stuff as it’s said you know doesn’t change ever the truth(laughs,rest smile)..anyway thus with all these through studies and practises the confusions went too finally realized can not be full without Mehu as I said so had to return and the press antics may be you’ve heard all the pain that public stunts and then innumerablly more undercover stunts had to happen to me and my break-up and all..thought of chewing up each everwhere and all thus these but you know afterall man it’s just nothing now I’m at a much better place mentally so yeah there were many things that I do regret but still the only consolation for me is that I tried to have fun and games with them atleast with my language still if they will take it as such(laugh,rest smile)..” Drew(smile) : “yeah I understand man,confusion was the reason not ego if your bunch is doing that they will get that down themselves(both smile) and no then we only realized your bunch a bit just seemed we did whole cause Unova still was out of order even to you(all laugh) but as usual Zed said what’s the big deal just have a look at civilization(all laugh) but it was just that illusion exactly why it’s so that ever thought you were too much in ego because of everything and you had everything none in 500 before and front were stopping you the zone outside were drawing you only unless it was someone like Zed but he still would’ve drawn just like you now as you know yourself we know too having seeing dragons for all these years especially at Johto you just FELL SO NAIVE(all laugh) but we didn’t understand that if it were ego that sentiment you will realize first hand so if it ever came and if you didn’t your bunch surely could force you to by Unova(all laugh) so anyway alls well that ends well man all looking so bright and your sis is giggling too much with the perfect never but close forever proposal of biased costs(both laugh) here’s she..” May(smile) : “bro..why weren’t you the best man for both of us(Drew and Seth laughs)..” Seth(laugh) : “why not marry your rose again today sun rises each day the everold new(all laugh)..and no dear I was so devillish to you that day last year but my dear May surely you being my sweetest little sis I could still get away with it had I called you just after so I’m not going to appologize cause you were too infatuated with temporal eventuality weren’t you(laugh,rest smile)..” May(smile) : “yeah just wish I can eat you with philosophical salads literally(Seth and Drew laughs,Mehadi smiles)” Seth(laugh) : “most welcome(all laugh)..in short you know that female travel companion of mine you saw yourself knew things yourself knew why I allowed her to travel still then all goes and last day just before parting the emotions of infatuation took over her and being Kalos from Kalos public seaport suddenly runs up and gets physical then didn’t say anything I just fared her off went to shower spend for first time in my life an hour(all laugh,Mehadi shakes her head laughing)..infact I realized why it’s so hard to gauge the moment just before you spew(May bursts into laughter,Drew laughs,Mehadi too laughs)..that’s called CULTURE(all laugh a lot)..infatuation hum infatuation I WILL CLEAR HER VOMIT BY MY OWN HANDS SENDING YOU THE PICTURES AND VIDEOS REAL TIME(laughs,May bursts into laughter,Drew laughs a lot too,Mehadi shakes her head laughing),that’s unforgettable stuff man with the dispotion and tone as added spice really 11 years doesn’t fade away like vomit totally(all laugh) anyway about that little brat from Kalos well after that incident later phoned her got the treatment and that treatment continued each time at each comeback attempt even if her family was there finally made an agreement last time as they accidentally met at Pasio Elite4 travels at the gym of Mr Daniel Dacarast of all people being relatives(all laugh),and yeah Drew the right to access to information law protagonists chased me at Rudy’s gym then detained me at navigation centre being directed by him(all laugh)..those two brats are after my life for 20 years you know(all laugh) anyway then reached an agreement with her whom I call Senor now(all laugh) that she was all wrong and that was it but to be honest I just having greeting officially married felt bad you know Clemont and what he is to me with him the same realtion she has as I had with Irissalad yeah back with sussages now added as the same being in different form a general doctor named Ferdinand(all laugh) as I said won Pasio yesterday had to with the obvious reaction of her brats across two regions left hence only going to face McShin now(all laugh) anyway I have a primonition that she will return someday as you know the smoothness doesn’t allow for grudes(laugh,rest smile) and as I was saying my only trouble then was that your anniversary had to be the very next day after that incident and if Unova was a random stranger this is from someone who saw me day and night for 31 months and my behaviour to her and all the rest no matter the public opinion still does that being who she is in academia as you know with that intelligence who herself became the ever sweet twin sis of Clemont and I knew how true she was which is the same as much as you’re my little sis across all eternity so that and then this and ever took as a little sis got turned out to be so and so and by then I was hardly alright in my head you sure know what my bunch does and says told Drew just now independent from me as my siblings no more master pokemon stuff nervous pressure all the time but just those words as they say and what they want to say and all that and then the break-up was 3.5 years old by then all combined for 6 years of my severity on personal relations and then this incident was the fire to hay you know and my problem was my soul was shaken that I see something with Clemont and me and then Bonnie and me and they are what they are to me ever brother and sister beloved and then this girl’s relation with them the same then I atleast expected her to behave as Anabel does as you know and then this happens so I suddenly was thrown in a dark confinement in infinity and then you called and my sweet little sister’s ever sweetest ‘bro’ that moment became something else to me dear,I forgot my sweet little doll May so dear to me ever and always way more than very own and replaced her with that so and so and that moment has been my worst day till cause I forgot you were my very very very own little sis for once in 14 years and thus could say all those then afterwards ever had a deep regret but all things combined never wanted to go back to old roots and mostly no personal relations my bunch ever was there with me my illusion that my very dear ones were only there for my smiles and warmth and skills and not my heart and soul suddenly gripped me and only rest was with the bunch who only realized the second part thus with them I thought that was it and given what they say I wanted to believe I don’t have anything else to do here and just thought if I was pure then all will return by themselves if that is eventuality and thus the antics at press to destroy any that came for a coffee and was going on till all else that indeed is mine as me eternally had to return hence first realized Mehu was my wife forever then all the rest shone is the greatest glory as Brock told were just those my thoughts and the time taken and the path chalked out to achieve it is something Drew knows best as said my bunch just before the Crawdauntogated final let’s tickle to be countering(laughs,rest smile) and that was what it was cause during Elite4 so many things happened so many personal siblinghoods rekindled like Cilan and Iris foremost and many many many more that will only enthrall you once you come to know and those were going on in one side the other deluded me that you and Drew and Max and Trace and Daisy and the rest weren’t my own so it was what it was and infact that moment final day just before leaving the region left a bitter taste in my mouth that’s all except those final few moments Kalos has been personally my best journey given my bunch’s transformation from being to self as they would call it(laugh,rest all smile) I got what I got from there and no you know given me and my obsession with difference surely I’ve had my full family ever in my first 5 regions,Dawn well still just 26.5 ample time for her to understand what is what and she is travelling Kanto now and incidentally met Mehu as you may not know a few days after the break-in was here at Cerulean just came over so that was very nice of her and is much changed now so I do hope I get to talk with sweet little Dawnny sister once more actually and Iris you know won Pasio final yesterday last region got the 6th now waiting for Hall of Fame journies as I said patched up when I was there at Elite4 as ever too sweet like my twin sis and Cilan you all know just Cili(laugh,rest smiles)..that brat like Trace and Brock and Drew too given appearing as of my gender can’t be expressed CULTURALLY(laugh,rest smile)..same thing with Clemont there at Kalos too he is very close to me and all so given everything except Serena all has been my close ones just wished she behaved properly atleast no matter the emotions but again that much is just the right kind of confession attempt an exam to the connoisseur(all laugh)..so yeah just happily accepted in family and happily married and all officialities will come as soon and visit to Daristrum as well to celebrate my coming nephew and or nice singular or plural in number triple delight for me(all smile)...” May(laugh) : “yeah for me too the other one soon as well we know too well(smile,Seth laughs,Mehadi  oy smiles at him,Drew smiles as well)..” Seth(smile) : “thanks for future-telling(laughs,all else smiles)..your prize is a coming in the end cause you know or if not your rose surely does the motto of battle starvation longer the wait stronger the feeling of the most ENJOYING(laugh,all else smile,Drew laughs) before that how are uncle and aunt but most importantly is Max alive afterall(all laugh)...” May(laugh) : “mentally that is(all laugh)yeah just the better halved pest is absolutely similar nature actually Max plays the saner half like my shrew(all laugh) no both are fine and will eat you up once they get the lines(all laugh) and mom,dad fine more fine cause if none else then Zed would’ve had to look after atmost 16/17 years(both and Drew laugh,Mehadi smiles) but mind the tense cause Zed surely won’t be found now(both and Drew laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth) and don’t bother all of us ever thought just that spoiled brat away from family too big in head thinks living seperate is such a daring thing(both and Drew laugh,Mehadi smiles) all are fine more than that but why the rush to the end hum leaving us homeless(all three laugh,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly smiling)” Seth(laugh) : “cause with all these family reunion going so emotional your rose will be busy no matter home or camp cause you with lack of words would just vomit aside(all three burst into laughter,Mehadi laughs shaking her head) countering yeah(all laugh)..” May(laugh) : “too clever I see cunningly(all laugh)..so how’s the honey in moon set(all laugh).” Mehadi(laugh) : “May am I not your big responsible gym leader sis(all laugh)..” May(laugh) : “um..sorry Ms(all laugh)..that was the mask no more in all cases(all laugh) but surely countering has reached the romantic long sermon part(all laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “too longing so cooked the climax for 7 hours(all laugh) finally the 3 words(all laugh)..but after all the long 11 year lonely journey coming to it’s fruitation within months nothing better than RESTING for you I guess(all laugh)..” May(laugh) : “mutual with double the years and a certain starting philosophy to add one more by all means(all laugh)..enjoy the dawn(all laugh).” Seth(laugh) : “right knowledgebale advise(all laugh) so here’s the prize as I say my bunch do the antics they do and I’ve listening to them for 22 years now in which if humanized will mean something extremely funny and yet meaningful at places and first and most importantly my bunch I’m sure everyone in contests know atleast Noivern and you too well among them having encountered the brat too many times(all laugh,May and Drew both reciprocates saying - ‘sadly across ages’ (all laugh even more) but Gengleye I guess..(all laugh,May and Drew both reciprocate as ‘just my Gengy’ all laugh even more) right,and Sableye jumped me at Hoenn itself so understandable(all laugh) but no whatever he was then this form wouldn’t have happened for neither him nor Gengar like Ferali and Daunty had they not been together and to be honest all 235 have learned off each other they know it the best exactly why it prooves that I was made a scapegoat for these brats to unite(laughs,all rest broadly smiles) and I’ll give 7 prizes for my dear sis and my dear bro-in-law and bro also Drew just make the time your brats require Gengleye for a couple of weeks relax cause you won’t then given Sablie knows both since your and his birthplace of all places the great Hoenn(all laugh)..this one first from Noivern professor of pokemon epistemology(all laugh) a challenger comes..
I see you want to attack but this thought of this attack that is appearing to you as a thought in your thoughts as a thought according to your previous thoughts as you see and deal with the thoughts of the issues that your master face at your age(all burst into laughter) see I was the chosen leader of my group but I was outsed cause you see master brat(all laugh) yeah that’s my official name finally now as you know so happy that I was right all along(all laugh) I was approached to solve a dispute that my group and other groups had during breeding season skirmishes but I told them that don’t disturb them it’s just that blooming youth(all burst into laughter)..230 out of 235 can’t breed now as you know but this to tell you professor Noivern is of course not among the 4 cause of that age(all laugh)..
next from Frontier comes the great Samurott too familiar to you May sadly and Drew too fortunately not that much(all laugh) his type is water-ground-dark..challenger comes..
dark must be bright/water must be not swam but alight/ground sure is to be swam as opposing me you agree might/that what’s at the left to me isn’t that at your right(all burst into laughter)..infallibale logic(all laugh)..
next is the only and only merchant at nowhere of somewhere sorry nowhere Reshiram(all laugh)..challenger comes..
before comeing here I was there from where I came here but now only from being here I can know from where I came but agin similarly now where I am I can only know if I go back to my previous place thus where am I actually(all burst into laughter)..merchant at somewhere sorry nowhere(all laugh)..
next come as a duo Butterfree and Palkia where Butterfree shows the challenger that he is the challenger and viseversa(all laugh) and Palkia circularly shows that you can’t know either yourself or the other(all laugh) this is joint..
I can’t know me and you can’t know you cause I only see me as not being as you and you can’t tell me who I really am cause you only tell me your ideas of who I am but you can see me and I can see you as diferent to me and you know I’m different to you but as you see me as different to you only then you know that you’re different from me thus ain’t it so that the difference that you are never what’s me only then can you know that you’re not me thus if you know me only as different to you then isn’t it so that you already know you(all burst into laughter,clap)..no more words circularly metaphysical(all laugh)..
now I will do this 6th first then keep the last 7th for the last cause that’s special so this is one from Hawlucha(all laugh) Pasio where I was the double champ thus lost the being in Mehu as 3rd day told mom,mom Seth um..he..um..(all laugh,Mehadi smiles  oy firmly Seth tenders her head)..mind the words and Hawlucha’s type as I say, standing on the air without the help of wings(all laugh)/but fighting on the ground though without the limbs(all burst into laughter,clap)/thinking of some thoughts without trying to think(all laugh,clap)/ideas and words May and Drew since 17 why are you trying to link(all burst into laughter,clap)..how’s the almost complete prize sister-pester(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “especially the last was going on in university lecture halls for sure hours after hours AGAIN AND AGAIN EACH TIME(all burst into laughter)..don’t blame poor birds and the word(all laugh)..we knew the joviality then itself at Kalos but not this form yet then(all laugh)..really made all the years bro and at this form surely Mr Seth Ketchum is double Hall of Fame in romance and comedy mastery says the savant(all laugh)..but tonight be specific while lost in Mehu(all laugh)..night all and good morning there to the sun mind that(all laugh)..”
Seth(laugh) : “I see Torchic has become Flygon(all laugh) and the sun after ever the moon(all laugh) on the rise(all laugh)..advanced ‘night to my sweet little sis with a hug and to her rose with a pat for being after all not infatuated with vomits only till the biased arguments isn’t it Drew isn’t it(all burst into laughter)..”
Drew(laugh) : “I wonder if it rhymes with Meditite(all laugh)..cause need the counter that you’ve been tested today itself and will be again(all laugh)..best of luck considering my position in career of cleaning in future tense you surely require generational concrete knowledge forward or backwards(all laugh) cause atleast it’s not intuitions on Blaziken’s type(all laugh a lot)..night in advance tickling for the surprize(all laugh)..”
Seth(laugh) : “I see shrewed(all laugh)..but what’s that disease(all laugh)..and no about Blazikens just wait till my brat entrs your sanity once more(all laugh)..anyway,before final prize sis and you too Drew,check up a Mr David Nofcun,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame,7 leagues,8-0,met me at Unova Round 1 as well,beat Laxy for Johto defeated by Marc for Ransei before that finally defeated Iris for Kanto,Celestic Sinnoh,double hall of fame being undercover at team rocket as main battler alongside me and check up his infoes at sometimes within may be 10 hours or 1(all laugh)..he is a legend that's not returning for a very very long time on per with Iris and Laxy but they will be the first ones to tell you he edges them in terms of surrender to himself the determination and May this is the name of my little bro your 2nd eldest bro now,found as you and me found our siblings same way,during undercover the closure then by Kalos Elite4 realized the final,faced Mehu while was at Kanto,which was his last region,Cerulean penaltimate badge,Pewter last,is here with me,wants to settle here my reach and riches will get the whole 11 city circle the southern Rainblue Hills annexed with Oak Labs including Frucifern starting lab and the centre here the lab HQ to max possible 6235 arcs here and this all is including the whole Zipgarnet Forest as conserved area yeah,need that spot to be private property hence this attitude(Seth and Drew laugh,others smile) and 9 cities cup competition will get revamped all Dave’s category and he is just Brock with a huge laugh,battle maddened too zealous too sweet too simple just May’s reddened version and May your 2nd eldest sis-in-law,Zara,is a corporate lawyer,out of profession,met during undercover,was with team rocket as lawyer didn’t know under whom she was working for a damn year and infact her skills floted them up a bit for a period before we entered and then the eventual,huge story all in good times,Dave is too simple and like Brock too naive himself will minutely tell you every second as if knows you for eternity like siblings as we are(smile,all else smile) and Zara is exactly like you my dear sis too sweet and she is my little sis as well like Drew is my bro but unlike her of course I did cross too many limits with Drew more than once too(laughs,May and Mehadi smiles and Drew laughs as well)..till now(all laugh)..and Dave well he is an once once legend already I guess as as you know being from undercover double hall of fame and surely Lance personally told me as good as him already and like Percy too you sure know him and Lance and Percy are real legends by all means personally too and Dave is surely at their category according to me as well in profession and the person you will soon see and just hug to death cause you will be first like what Brock or Trace do(laugh,all others smile),but anyway well,Dave’s parents and Uncle and aunt all are in farm business but his parents went inside his mind when he was 15 and the reason was they were caught in an accident at a farm and the reason was team rocket they were most unfortunate,the financial support was there ever for Dave and he is just too interested a battle nut doesn’t understand anything else too simple and his uncle and aunt supported and his cousin big bro and his other half Lucian and Tayla as well all are out of profession Lucian is at a service huge service financial stuff,chartered accountant at some import-export company and Tayla own businesses all too sweet..neither Dave nor Zara wants to leave my side and infact Brock we will need at the full Rainblue Southern and 6235 here and in any case the whole colony it will be and hence that naive crook must absolutely be here to complete it with Violet(all smile),Dave knows about each and every one of you pretty well went to Pettlesberg too during Elite4 there his second while I was doing Sinnoh,just haven’t met you two and Max and his case is that in Kalos Elite4 you surely know about the differentiation then I actually didn’t find any happiness being at human level as I said cause with most subtle levels with my bunch I was at my real home more and wanted to live the life of a Gengar as you know my name was told and Dave realized it confronted me saying you still have me and Zara atleast so halt that was the cherry on the 4 year cake got my bro and larger family and Mehu finally why I couldn’t become a Gengar literally(laugh,all rest smile) but now will cause I’ve become FULL now(laugh,all else broadly smile),so this is a brotherly present for both of you and little bro little pest..”
May(smile,bit shivering voice of joy, rew,Drew smiles at her and tenders her) : “bro..just wait till I gobble you up with costly sausage(all laugh)..and Max will beak him off as usual on different approaches to emotional management of Pangoro(all laugh)..really,Gengar I realize now that was just budding my little big Gastly bro then(both laugh and Drew too laughs,Mehadi smiles looking at Seth  im firmly),can’t wait to meet my 2nd bro and pester him(all laugh) and lawyers are well educated so delicious the food for me(all laugh)..really bro it’s just all the 1 year for me came back by all 16 of joy(all smile)..” Seth(smile) : “well my sweet little sis you may have to wait a bit longer to get more sausage in cause there’s every chance now that we may get our baby Dawnny in as well as I said I wish I could talk with her once more well the path has been made clearer now I guess with her travel companion and recently realized soulmate(laugh,all others broadly smile) that’s Mr Magnus Glenol is only Mr Brawn Glenol’s son as you might’ve heard from Zed,the Yellowburst City gym leader once ever man by all means(all laugh)..surely you know those who are everhappy(all laugh,May and Drew says,professionally in person,all laugh)..yeah had to given the head teacher(all laugh)..well Mango is already at a tremendous level with his career as much as Fel,Cello and Quittie is and we need him to better them all combined cause given Dawn’s leftover regions including Kalos,Pasio and Unova means Mango will be in-charge of the communications that will be evident with my career having ended that all labs will want the brats hence he has to communicate..you know him as you little bro and now all the more in-law too I’m really happy that no no matter the existential doldrums surely neither me nor you nor Brock were mistaken about our sweet little baby Dawn(all smile)..but this actually means that you can understand how good he is with regards to why Dawn’s bunch is more than fine with him mentally that is(all laugh)..Dawn finally realized the illusion she was in I get that as soon as she understood the illusion that forced her to do things that she did at Hoenn just understood it hence the illusion broke out in laughter as usual with Mango there to brighten it to the utmost for her as Mango said,and we all know none can tame a Cobalion first region first caught in psychic channels no matter what like she did and then to continue that winning streak to get her first title totally unbeaten everywhere you both knew were as good as you already and you had dragons..Dawn the reality finally is here and I just have a feeling that we’ll have our sweet baby back with us,surely you know dear sis why we are siblings and why thus Dawn is too cause surely you know me and I know you and also along with the viseversa your beau too(laugh,May and Drew broadly smiles,Mehadi beams  oy firmly)..” May(overjoyed) : “yeah you’re not going to alive for long my sweet bro(Seth laughs and rest smile)..” Drew(smile) : “no,man with your personality and those questions I faced first hand when you no matter what weren’t this cunning a pro(Seth laughs shaking his head,others smile),surely neither can you stop extending your family nor live without them just like Gengar(both and May laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth);ever had your bro with you still while not with us(all smile)..and about Kalos too not for nothing they are so mad about you(Seth laughs)..and yeah Dawn has just found her real place it’s just a most pleasing moment to both of us here just wish can meet her soon but not her Cobalion(laugh,Seth and May too laugh)..really man,Gengar we realize now in full ticklly(both laugh others smile)..I’m just speechless in joy just best wishes and yeah questions too,a real bash awaits(all smile)..” Seth(smile) :”yeah,at earliest and tomorrow will be vieo calls for hours get prepared for surprizes well may be 7/8 hours only but hence sleep well(laugh and Drew also laughs,other’s smile) and yeah Drew,Tony boy with his psycho will be dealt by me tomorrow Oliv gently and Tony boy not so at all(both laugh,others smile) they by now have been told and are in cloud 90 already literally from 9(both laugh,others smile) and still there are other cartoons of family like (both laugh and others smiles)..” Drew(laugh) : “well Tony will try to bunk the bash unless given feeding bottles(all laugh)..Coop the same may be worse(all laugh)..but protect Mehadi from Penny you know always had contacts which increased as you weren’t there as usual as was with Yumn,Kane and Harris(all laugh) and well Clyde and Scarlett are just that(all laugh) and Penny still says I’ll see who opens the door first(all laugh) including us yeah(all laugh)..but yeah about the Gengar I surely know the fate of certain hall of famers that were in Brock’s words too beautiful(all laugh)..no I knew all about that but you know that pained both me and your sis to the utmost cause our head said one thing heart something else as we stayed there at the gym for a week and now just so happy that reality prevailed while both of you are here cause that was our primonition as well but Seth given everything surely the brat would swap places won’t he given Huntelion and Karapasker combined is nothing to beauty comparable to Daristrum of all places(all laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “well if only there’s gurantee that the destination won’t be camoflaged being Ulstock in reality(all laugh)..and no man I haven’t been to Daristrum just heard about it as all has surely they were right to not have a grass gym there too with Meganiums everywhere surely(all laugh)..went to the offices with GiraCozma(all laugh)..rest is just back to basics(all laugh)..yeah would be most relieved actually with your picture at home worshipped each day till both gets permanent regional citizenships(all laugh)..then I can’t guarntee of your continuing Godhood(all laugh)..surely most welcome you two are at Cerulean cause the contest has been doing well but it just needs to be WOKEN(all laugh),and now,this final is the prize now completes only today 99 still left and then circulate(all smile) to be happy(all smile) as I said always my bunch this all was just cause of them have delivered only a better version of me Tyranitar all the way(laugh others smile) so this,comes from the one and only Yveltal(all laugh)..surely all of you know that brat(all laugh,May and Drew replies laughing,’unfortunately to the utmost to happiness(all laugh)’)..challenger comes..
I see you want to challenge cause you want to be happy/and all it’s so cause you’re unhappy(all burst into laughter,clap)/cause within your self you’re not happy/thus you can’t see others as being happy(all laugh clap)/thus if you really want to be happy/then you must know first what makes you unhappy(all burst into laughter,clap)/thus you see this idea of being happy and unhappy/ever is opposite to the other thus shouldn’t you be happy(all burst into laughter,clap)..in pursuit of happiness(all laugh and clap),night(all burst into laughter and reciprocate and bye)..”
(few moments later)
Mehadi(laugh) : “surely Seth if these brats are there you got to be happy(both laugh)..and I’m so happy to be Seth(smiles at Seth and hugs Seth very firmly)..”
Seth(smiles at Mehadi and  ehadi very firmly) : “right cause you’re not unhappy being not not so(both laugh)..saw that Mehu none came for any reason you just most dear they around that as important as you are ever with me but that brat Yveltal too sadly(both laugh)..now back to bro he told me about the match and all knew about you cause in last days of undercover that’s the custom if any of the colleagues get out tells the dear ones the fate and atleast tells the authority their condition cause they may neglect them or if they have any special messages and so onand then you know always under the gillotine anyway you’re very close and then we come out he is a battle buff(laugh,Mehadi smiles) no emotion no personal life nothing parents weren’t in profession but big fans he was 14 when they passed on in an accident at his hometwon for some of their deals where they were entagled in the farm and thus was the misfortune he went to his uncle Mr Eden and has a cousin bro 2 years older to him Lucian out of profession excellent man just like his dad and mom and his mom Dave’s aunt is Mrs Jessica and also Lucian’s other half Tayla as well excellent person they all are very very nice people very cheerful nice persons and his parents were financially very well positioned as are his uncles and cousin as well and Lucian is in a company very good post import export business huge company infact and he is in finace departments a chartered accountant too good a post then Tayla as well does some small
business independent and Mr Eden is in farming business as was Dave’s parents Mr Reynold and Mrs Molly and Dave thus was ever financially very secured and had the backing so that was ok he will himself tell his family history and my undercover days to you too enthusiastically cause
to him and later while I was vulturing around Cerulean to book my flower I was chiding him and Simon who was in my gang as to I want Mehu immediately(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs) so he knows you extremely well and will be so too happy to meet you by any medium(laugh,Mehadi smiles) Dave is just a man like Brawn you know everhappy carefree soul Dave is of the very same nature as I said a battle nerd outside world is forgotten and faced me at Unova first round Feraligator defeated Palkia with one ice beam(laugh) next round Crawdaunt against Tapu Koko same result a dark beam and Crawdaunt zapped back to me ate up my cap had a reserve put it on(both laugh) then upset thought illegal later in undercover James of all people was my confident he wanted me there and I would’ve been there you know Mehu cause my bunch would’ve smoked off any legends then not all but most could and I had no fear from that and generally you’re only in a life threat if you get too deep which other profeesionals should do after you get the pokemons sorted out but we did all me and Dave ever went forward protecting all cause the situation was that there were pokemons as guards not humans and so on so we needed to work side by side to get them totally busted and thus it went on and Dave found Zara there his wife now for 5 years immediately married after getting out.Zara is a corporate lawyer just a Pidgey keeps at santuary with others(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth) from Sandgem Town,Sinnoh as well but it’s 4900 km apart from Celestic(laugh) but at the soul nothing so only pure happiness and unison(both smile at each other same pose) she was 42 when we met her 15 years career then one of her close friends betrayed deceived her into this hell..Zara was working for Team Rocket and then our group got her within 2 months and infact her side change turned the tides for us along with Jesse of all people(laugh) and both turned for their husbands(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and tenders his hairs) well Jesse did Zara only came to know she was hired for wrong reasons and she has a stupendous record at corporate defense thus only Team Rocket by that time despite being beset from all quarters could keep afloat,anyway and you know Dave faced the same atrocity as me as did the other 4 people in our group and he is exactly like a child I have ever been most cunning fox just ask spew for that(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs) it was horrendous on him in the middle days Iris was there too as you know cried to me each day still infact today your condition reminded me of her much(laughs,Mehadi smiles tendering Seth)..Zed wasn’t approachable most times you know he won’t do what we could do hence he only kept at our back but once we were busted he too was captured in but then just as usual did what he does remained too calm in captivity you can’t penetrate him with that bunch and all the boss and Chansbert for the whole time tried to hypnotize him for 4/5 months and you know the result(laughs,Mehadi smiles  oy)..Iris couldn’t battle after the initial days her story is another stuff I’ll tell you later but she just wasn’t well mentally so I had her to bear her full responsibility along with her bunch but Dave was good enough to battle still but battle you know it was nothing my brats as you know Unova and then this jovial nature was settling in and Crawdauntogator showed that in the final and these brats now are like topmost category legend in power similar as best trained best normal max power but their intelligence is way way heigher as you see and it’s just that that was ok I ever felt an attraction to Dave since I met him just before undercover he ate the bait cause of that accident that sent his parents away into abstraction when he was 15 had a huge reason to jump and did so he is a famous name you know 6,7 would’ve been 7/7 had he not faced me at Unova best battler from Sinnoh for sure in number two in the world I guess just below Lance only cause of experience and he’s 66 still(both laugh) phenomenal battler and still Lance says before I go will surpass me(laughs,Mehadi smiles) and you know how hard that is against Lance than in last 15 years only 2 loses and who Lance is personally to end this assumption(smile,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs)..he is a record holder as the only man who has won 5 regions with 0-10 margin even Sakura says evaporated me(laughs,Mehadi smiles in same pose)..Kalos was a bit emotional tried too hard thus 4-6 and Percy was a bit more motivated cause of that press his beau is a far worse sample than Irissalad(both laugh)..and his only loss at Pasio didn’t win and only went down in head to head record against Percy if all people(laughs,Mehadi smiles in same pose  oy)..would’ve won Unova too I knew that all else did certainly Monkhbat agrees whole time the best opponent was fed to Feraligator to see if he’s a pokemon thus you know the examiners said NO!IT’S INHUMAN!(both laugh)..Dave is just next to Lance you know Iris faced him after we all came together one on one and you understand Mehu who Iris is and what she is now is just manifolds better than what you last know cause her life has come full circle now is just amusing personality she is and then she couldn’t beat him either or even draw(laughs,Mehadi smiles)..and Iris saw full Unova first hand Dave knows my bunch yeah undercover is a different league but still Iris would’ve fitted there as good as Dave did that too I know so he is what he is you know like Saul you know for 22/23 years Mehu..I met him once more at Pasio Elite4 this time his other half Junia hall of fame Contests(laughs,Mehadi broadly smiles)..just like Barry and Whinny same stuff(laughs,Mehadi smiles  oy firmly)..had a great experience there really and no the beautiful men has just been awakened talked with the soulmates when I was here at Pallet before our match was a bit surprized with everything their soulmates weren’t said just Palkian life(both laugh)..and no those men were only waiting for the moment as you know just a case not exactly but similar to Pulu(laughs,Mehadi smiles),anyway about Dave finally won Kanto absolutely so he was devastated in that situation undercover and I did what I could do for all else in battle and all and as much in personal life but I was in similar situation as well and Chu was kept with mom then you know he loses it if I’m in danger and he won’t be jovial though hemost certainly can like Yveltal or Noivern if with me cause it’s just that view of his that he must guide me and all and his bossing around Feraligator of course got and turned on me and then all these(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering is hairs),anyway,Dave was aghast and I did what I could to protect him during battles and outside and Zara as you know same nature too simple sweet little girl and she understood that they weren’t right the legal side of Rocket and all then met Dave you know soulmates will come close and Dave was saved cause she realized his condition and all that this just 2 months into it then those atrocities weren’t affecting Dave cause just started then huge story both faced hazards and that stuff battle for human prizes Dave all the time had Bulbasaur and he just you know his nature only he could be given to another and he just was like 10000 Bulbasaurs and the intelligence and all decimated every electric,fire and rock dragon possible who were swelled up to max but Bulbasaur was something and Dave got the weeds out while Bulbasaur got the interference off and if not Bulbasaur then I had 2 ghosts or psychics who were with Dave and later Zara always had atleast two and all of my colleagues same in the end we were 11 Zara came those two to make it 9 and then another couple and another two persons they and the better half of the other couple they were battlers and thus we were 6 in the end and all of those 6 are having their honest life now though as you know Team Authority is behind them anyway,then Dave infact fought for many people to be honest all didn’t defect to us but total 13 excluding us 6 and Zara are now in honesty again out of illusion and all didn’t defect but were neutral in our favour and so on then many later now happy life and the greatest boss the most totally happy now absolutely as I said and he is a 1 time champ from Hoenn and 1st region was Hoenn but sadly then went to Sinnoh just his 2nd region and that was it and he is so happy now and so on all my bunch universal pester buddies for eternity(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs) and then anyway Dave and Zara married the next month they came out and Dave is such a sweet child went out 2 weeks later to Kanto for next title(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs) and I ever had contact with him and Zara was with Lucian and Tayla was more than safe away from profession and they I told you rich family and with Lucian and Tyala it’s just massive wealth and they have a son Thor 10 year now sweet boy they are like Brawn too as is Mr Eden and Mrs Jessica whole family is like that and so on and then Dave had same two months in Kalos as did I as you know I went according to my whims really and they budged Mehu cause you surely know the bottom line why I’m tolerated and I play that only I’m a real cash cow for them cause they will be sent to cosmic darkness along with their bunch if they approached my bunch even non psychics the general pokemon connecting channels by that they will fondle them to abstruce vulgarity sending them to another plane not returnable so I can’t thus I’m the scapegoat as I have to save my buddies from humans and that’s the bottom line(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and tenders his hairs) anyway,then you know that press conference beau vs bro differentiation and I by then was Gengar and Dave understood that confronted me said it’s not that there’s none in the world for you to forsake your human self,live for me and Zara as to us your obligations being a human will never finish in this life atleast thus don’t become a Gengar so quickly(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and tenders his hairs)..then I said even if your own bro you can shackle the body never the mind and then we understood that we’re brother’s for eternity and then he was ever beside me and so on and now at the farm first day office Elite4 Sinnoh I call jumped here I said are you out of your mind Zara you know like Drew to me as well but Drew I have a fool around relation Zara is sweet little sis like May and so really I’m so happy to have all of them here and they infact want to come here I’ll with my now power which only has increased cause I have resigned(laugh) and with that I will make the lab stupendus with my targetted 6235 arcs here as HQ sending all the weeds out of Pallet making it a villege again and this area will have the Zipgarnet Forest totally covered up as preserved area only for our profession and thus we will need a pokemon centre ourselves and thus I want Brock to be here as well and well(laugh) I’ll drag him here no matter and Violet is just so naive(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and hugs him very firmly hiding her face in his chest,smiling) and we both me and Dave were offered instant Hall of Fame after Rocket rejected both and thus if he wants Dave can stay here I’ll go to the gym anyway and mom either in lab of Cerulean and you know mom would herself offer this to Dave and Gary and Lillie infact needs a parent figure you know what I’m saying and Professor is 95 now as is grandma and hence this you know Gary,just my twin bro and mom sees him like me since beginning and she will be too happy to be there and Lillie well(laugh) just will be on the moon cause that has been her only regret not having a figure like that and Brock well(laughs,Mehadi smiles in same pose)..that brat will be here no matter as will our Viol flower to complete the rhyme(both laugh) they will be given surprizes not me or Mehu flower but that will be from my bro at the farm who will jump them I just told him your older bros Gary is twin and the sister in laws are my wife’s elder sisters only whole family just so naive(laugh,Mehadi broadly smiles at Seth  im firmly),more left sweetie I want you to beam even more(smiles and hugs Mehadi very firmly,Mehadi smiles at him and hugs him very firmly as well)..Dr Muk Skechit’s Muk inhibitation was under threat by Kanto Elite4 junior faction huge group and Hector Skechit was there his company was used to snatch away the bragging rights there and so on and the faction was sweared to hell cause I was angry that the vultures were stenching the place and first causing troubles everywhere here then Lance then that Lance told me later after that picture I saw of your’s the special nomination one I was incensed that I was foolish enough to not know my sweet Mehu flower is my soulmate and 5 years I’m away from her so I knew after Lance said things about you and I decided to raid the whole world but sadly with Giratina and Ultranercozma(laugh) and then there itself forced Lance to tell me about the great Kanto vultures and he did so in return to his breaking his code and doing all for me I sweared the hell out of Kanto Elite4 everyone that Lance indicated the lobbies in the middle of night compelling them to listen to me and they pointed fingers at Lance for letting me off and that nexus stuff and all I said lets see what you can do when I selcet people and give them my bunch and they come into our profession to make it a monopoly at Kanto gym systems and I know a lot of people here who desperately want that cause they are fed up with your performances in the last 10-15 years and the start will be Pewter one of the most neglected ones sure you don’t want my Tyranitar of all right(laugh) and they knew about Sabrina and Gengar was fostered by her and the rest is understandable cause Cerulean could’ve hosted the most dreadfull 6 pack CrawdauntogatorlerSeismirottzel(laugh) Floatzel shows the difference between grounded water and watered ground(both burst into laughter) Samurott gives the soultion to swim at ground and walk at water cause the trouble is not knowing what’s at your left is at my right(both burst into laughter) then Seismitoad gives the final generalization that all trouble will cease if it’s understood that ground and water are interchanging each moment whare are you(both burst into laughter) Kingler recruits moles for my bunch to send them to Crawdauntogator(both burst into laughter) and those brats plan the doom and distribute it among many at the end of which all will oppose themselves only(both burst into laughter)..and Typhlosion also helps Kingler by insinuating he wants to stop running after desires(both burst into laughter) thus gets the type disadvantage of own type and of course the Grass,Bug and Steel and Electric etc infoes to serve to Crawdantogator to plan the impending doom(both laugh) and Crwadauntogatorlerphlosion and Seismirottzel are two universities who exchanges students for better experience so that on passing out they become like Gary’s Magmorter and Golem the best perfect professionally personal moles yeah the language I was using upon you(both burst into laughter)...” Mehadi(laugh) : “man,this is brutal(both laugh)..really Seth,you sure were in a too happy place atleast with these brats(both laugh) I don’t want any moles anywhere around the gym(both laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “then they will tell me we see that SOMBRE STAT(both laugh) yeah you’re a brat too(both laugh) so SOMBRE STAT starves in that gym serving his cause SOMBRE STAT is not not male(both laugh) bunch substandard food to get them turn against her and thus stay depressed then when look-only-at goes bodyslam him most vigourously cause of this prolonged sorrow is all just to get that moment to be the most ENTHRALLING(both burst into laughter) we see too much bonhomie(both burst into laughter)..these pests are something really..” Mehadi(laugh) : “I also get your antics as well(both laugh)..no really Seth all knows about that press conference..I just thought that Seth is with someone else but he told all what he did just for me(smiles at Seth  im very firmly,Seth also smiles at Mehadi  er very firmly)..” Seth(few moments later,smile) : “never in at no times(both broadly smile at each other,same pose)..no sweetie you and me-Mehadi and Seth-just never is it possible that it’s not so(both smiles at each other)” Mehadi(smile,same pose,few moments later) : “right,and Seth just what to say so overjoyed to have a little bro and sis too(both smile at each other broadly)..really Seth I’m never without you(both hug each other very firmly smiling)..” Seth(smile,few moments later) : “anyway back at Platue after I saw the sweetly Mehadivious picture of my sweetie,I just sewared the hell out of them and then eventually that inhibitation trouble people came to know as those opposing Lance were united disunited after me cause Sinnoh is run by me and Kalos will do anything for me with that money and Unova is Unova thus I have a monopoly here and the bottom line and the bunch and the antics and all the nature I’m really the most dreaded playboy to them and to me only Mehu’s boy eternally(smiles and hugs Mehadi very firmly,Mehadi hugs Seth very firmly smiling) from that first day at the lake to this image and also to my flower(laugh) then they budged and all this news is recent all surprize few hours later may be Gary is already alarmed to go there(laugh) Professor was told yesterday night in very brief and all then tomorrow surprize and Lillie will be over the moon if Daisyl is happy(both laugh) and I just love to get after DaisyDaisyl(both laugh) just so naive(both laugh) as is Lillie wig and Violtine(laugh) and finally though Hector has been saved and came to know what Trace is finally and just too extremely overjoyed that the dumb jackal as ever is right so the whole family Mehu with my bro if he wants and he will I know all at the lab at 6000+ arcs at HQ with 5 directors and Dave at Lomstom cities cup special hall of fame by means of earning it twice and will stay only here of course and Pewter will get everything and Yellowburst well Brawn is Brawn(laugh) and my flower will be seen as exactly as she is in the self so whole family Mehu all here for you as the post order marital negotitaions in all due honesty of ethical honesty in morality of ethics of honesty in ethical honesty of ethics(burst into laughter,Mehadi beams at Seth  im firmly,Seth tenders her smiling) Mehadi(smile,same pose) : “Seth I’m just so so overjoyed from yesterday this time to that session 7 hours when I thought most darkness to finally now..(chokes in joy,both smile at each other and hug each other very firmly)..” Seth(smiles,same pose) : “my sweet Mehu dream..(both smile and hug each other very firmly,few moments later)..Dave and all else all huge stories you’ll hear and after Undercover he was then just a teammate for life but yet to be family same right after Undercover but later ever was like family both of them and I also had that feeling for them both and then during my Elite4 where I made my schedule you know they say once in a millenia and you know now that’s cause only nowhere(both laugh) and also the Dusknoir I have no moment can be pointed out as exactly now at this point thus time can’t be exactly pointed out as to what is the exact time now so all is flowing and unstable this 2nd master who also is a brat(both laugh) and not not male(both laugh) is time cause she’s unstable in emotions as to go or stay(both burst into laughter) Malamar said before sleeping she knew if agitated she will sleep now she’s sleeping but knows again will wake up and same emotions thus who’s sleeping while awake(both burst into laughter) who am I Malamar(both laugh) and these two ghostly pests were saying she wants to suddenly appear but doesn’t know to tickle before to get the land ploughed(both burst into laughter and fool around with each other a bit then again laughs and hugs each other firmly,few minutes later)..so you understand I was getting those in breaks while you were so sweetly dozing firmly in my arms(both laugh)..Mehu you’re so so sweetie(both smile at each other ach other firmly)..after those words came from you like then am I extra to you I said as me but worded differently and then sleep powder and hugged you to death telling those brats make sure this sweet Gyarados doesn’t wake up I want to fondle her to death my sweet Mehu is so sweetie(both giggle at each other ach other firmly)..anyway,so I had to get my ways with my Elite4 schedule but Dave got Kalos in same 2 months as me and I wanted to be a Gengar so badly and Dave resisted I told you before and then we understand your eternal sibling relation and we hugged each other that was formality and he has helped to work behind the whole world’s back to get infoes about you and Cerulean and is at the farm set up many surprizes waiting for my bros here all in good times(Mehadi smiles) and he saw each he was my lackie here before I departed for Cerulean(both laugh) the last time I was here and all he is still office bearer at Sinnoh and hall of fame means very special and came here after 2 days of office cause it’s family to him and so on so yeah I’ve a bro and a sis as well(smiles at Mehadi,Mehadi smiles at Seth)..so all most important stories done now the biggest one being in 24 hours Ms Mehadi Waterflower becomes Mrs Mehu Ketchum(both smiles at each other ach other very firmly for few minutes)..” Mehadi(smile) : “but that is exactly Seth,even 24 hours ago we were oceans apart,what is made you return actually?”
Seth(laugh) : “well I was living my life roaming around as a Gengar(both laugh)..which is what it is actually(both laugh)..but you know it now Mehu just truly only now(both smile each other and hug each other very firmly smiling at each other,few moments later)..you were pulling ears and hairs for the POTENTIALITY as well(both laugh)..just Mehu(both smile at each other ach other very firmly,few moments later)..well so I was going around till I reached Lance,and then the aftermatch party,Lance having known me very well and being a constant support when Tyranitar forced me to REVOLT(both laugh) yeah my Shiftree revolts against being a Shiftree(both bursts into laughter) invoke a revolution from within to revolt against the same(both burst into laughter) cause the first revolution is to revolt against you the second is thus to revolt against it else that revolution itself will become you won’t it(both burst into laughter),anyway(both laugh),so Lance has ever been kind and all then first I met you on 3rd hardly had any troubles Mehu as I told you it just never mattered and just spoke that bit then went off people asked me this and that cause we’ve been linked up for eternity and all and my image was that I wasn’t nice to my travel companions cause when they got them my little sis and Brock and all they didn’t give the best of views same with you cause they got your dejection and Senor at Kalos too was asked after that press and all(both laugh) she said same stuff and she is doing her post research now never stood less than second ever anywhere in academia(both laugh) I just feel bad for her you know shouldn’t have done what she did like that atleast given everything and being herself 32 then should’ve been midful atleast..anyway,so they just got the ego part that I did do much professionally but personally not much Cilan refused to speak absolutely the right thing to do cause by then he had come to realize that we were bros for eternity hence it encompassed all here atleast Gary and May too so desisted from saying one word,Iris just gave a lukewarm response wasn’t padded then(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..yeah this is the term for their former selves(both burst into laughter) from their perspective I’ve abjectly failed in my pursuit to reach what they’ve reached that is that maddening tune that is they don’t have to counter cause they can start now whereas I still have to counter(both laugh a lot)..anyway so then I spoke with you myself they just thought well atleast doesn’t directly show his ego(laugh) then they asked did you know of her hall of fame status I said yeah I’ve had many many friends at Cerulean who are very close to me and they also know her very well professionally so yeah I know this then they said well you’ve travelled the longest with her(both laugh) and during that time both were new both had your own names and all were treated as enigmas and surely given her out of profession career and stardom do you really feel well both of you have fulfilled your promise,I was waiting for this exact word(all laugh) so said definitely she had it easier outside cause for her both sets will clap for me only one side rest will be too jealous won’t they(both laugh) it was said as a joke and also as a way to tell them don’t try me(both laugh) anyway then they got that and didn’t say much but I realized your presence there was a matter of curiosity from them so I later asked a few has she done something great recently like something phenomenal in a match or so cause I felt she attracted more curiosity from here than interest,they said no just that she hasn’t done many matches and all official stuffs after the nomination citing personal necessities so it was a bit strange to see her here abruptly cause it’s a official party today had no idea that she will turn up out of blue cause wasn’t invited(all laugh),I said well given the number of invites atleast hope she has been able to get a few drinks here(both laugh),so it was just that then next day the match goes on you know and how it was built and sold so was record crowds and all it has been a showcase stuff more like an opera(both laugh),Lance emptied his full tank of 160 brats(both laugh) so I had to oblidge too and had full 166 actually Lance did 3 special rounds with the 7 Choiced brats from the reservation the very first one was Chu cause had to get a result(both laugh) so that was the starter vs starter then the whole gang was set up for next 12 rounds the second was between Drapion vs my Incineroar(both laugh) last vs last(both laugh)..now Lubos and Persy both said we’re not going to tell them to battle just will tell them to have fun and still if they return then only you win(both laugh) so they did return(both laugh) but Lance told me I’m not instructing them just get your most serious brat round one get a result then it’s just a once ever drama(both laugh) and it did happen to be so so yeah we are just happy that the brats played to the script(both laugh) anyway then the next 11 rounds each had total 165/11 15 brats all at a time(both laugh) thus happened the opera that I was talking about you know it really has been an absolute showcase at the cost of the referee(both laugh) we get that 15 vs 15 where each group elects the 3 set of 5 brats as the others form the panel to review(both laugh) my brats just pestered the referees and Lance’s brats to the utmost then the dignitaries bench the most(both laugh) and Lance was hardly alive laughing said my age hinders me now(both laugh) then after that showpiece the corwd really was over the moon and all after match Lance just said man just this match alone has made me the richest what to speak of you(both laugh) so we just had a brief chat but then I had to send all the brats away which took 1 full hour(both laugh) then I had half an hour before the party started so I said I’ll get to privacy a bit so went at a place sat beneath a tree with Chu and Pidgeot only they were fooling around with themselves I just was reminiscencing my whole 22 years and 3 months there and now that the formal career and battling to have ended really I didn’t know what I could do,once thought ok let’s go to Kalos and follow Sabrina opening a gym of any type allowed(both laugh) then thought well may be go to Sinnoh or Unova and do the same then thought but what will be the point given I can’t battle neither can be happy for some reason here atleast my big sis can do both still(both laugh)..anyway,then I knew was in a mess so thought may be if Unovan legends do too much will go and won’t return may be and then it really did strike me that except mom I really don’t have any personal relations all are my family but know that closure is too abstract for me to do anything here atleast for mom I could stay then thought well she will have her home at the lab so may be it’s ok still she can live on I had so many brothers and sisters anyone would’ve loved to have her and if none else for unavoidable situations atleast my big sis is ever there I know that so it was ok and then I really thought that well may be that is the right thing to do hence I actually went into the party a bit unmindful anyway then at party Lance rather in a personal manner asked me why am I doing all these publicity things saying strange words and so on,I just brushed him off and told him that no it’s all right,I’m just enjoying the attention till it dies down next year itself,Lance rather compassionately said that he knew me for 15 years may be,and he’s on his last 3 years of service and knew Professor very well,so if I want I may tell him what it was or if it was about someone or something and this cause he might be able to help me if such be the case said you and your bunch aren’t getting forgotten in next millenia atleast no matter who may come cause as you know Mehu you can’t do better than this is this profession only expand more hence his statement and then I don’t know,he knew your condition and he knew we travelled together at a time,and we both were in hall of fame now in two separate departments,then he knew we saw each other the day before and you were in so much trouble and knew something was wrong with me too hence I don’t know might’ve guessed something might’ve thought you were there to tell me something then changed your mind or that I had told you to come and all,may he be blessed always,but God really send him to me that day,otherwise Mehu it’s ok I would’ve been with Gengar at death but you in next 4 months..my sweet Mehu flower would’ve(hugs Mehadi very firmly)..”
Mehadi(smile,tenderly,tendering Seth’s hairs) : “it’s ok Seth,continue” Seth(same pose) : “I knew you were hurt but I never knew why cause you were supposed to know first hand my bunch and then your troubles were a letter away from getting halved so I didn’t understand what happens if I’m out and my wife is harrased like that only cause she is too sweet and nice and given her position in the City and it’s expansions by all means just didn’t want it to stop did all that she could but burnt inside cause I wasn’t there unlike before and that I only realized after I realized our true selves and yeah had I returned certainly with Crawdauntogator not one word would’ve been said there ever again(both laugh) and I regret that really cause it was a matter of a week certainly not right after that incident but before it I could’ve returned for just a few days cause first be it Crawdauntogator or Donphan,they were enough to beat 100 hall of fames each day(both laugh) so I just didn’t know but no I still laugh at myself that I said all those vicious things to you cause you’re way is now Seth is doing this so I won’t(both laugh) so Seth jumped upon brats and you were polite(both laugh)..but no Mehu the Pasio beauties are something indeed already the sea beachs have tremendus troubles with Palkian life of not knowing a thing until the absolute truth value is known(laugh,Mehadi burst into laughter)..yeah that’s why the circular logic(both laugh)..this was fed to the brats there were too happy then so now is rather blindly implementing those a month later(both laugh) but they are you know very good persons it was just that illusion too deep and the grassed beauties just understood the troubles all the more cause of your own status and temperant of hall of fame unplugged(both laugh) but man that brat at Frucifern got a lesson that he just can’t ever forget this term(both laugh) but the funniest moment of my life was when the Conferenced beauties wanted to enforce the law of access to informations upon me at navigation centre(both laugh) that was something,the whole place was like are they from Mars(both laugh) and indeed faced the public gaze for that foolishness there then(both laugh)..that moment you know is really something for me ever like they were so serious the whole place was laughing and I just couldn’t stop myself from getting killed out of laughter(both laugh) anyway Mehu I just wished these brats understood the right at right time which they did later but the Frucifern brat is going to have some life indeed(both laugh) and no you know,just that day you said take your trophies back that you know send me the signal that it was about preferring my bunch and hence I never cared till that picture but sweetie you can’t be you without me I knew it then but Mehu I’m..” Mehadi(smile, oy very firmly) : “it’s ok sweetie,it’s ok it was only you as me as it is and will be hum..my sweetie..(both hug each other very firmly smiling and continue for a few minutes)..” Seth(smile) : “right,um..actually you know Pasio did give me the pungent feelings that I knew the reason wasn’t Trace(both burst into laughter) well I didn’t talk about the second thing that was may be most important to do had I returned was to get our DaisyDaisyl married off(both laugh) she was just having a very hard life then as to what exactly to do and the jackal was as usual foxing around(both laugh) so once that was fixed it would’ve been a cakewalk for me so actually this I will tell all crucifying Trace that the whole illusion is all due to that dumb buffoon(both laugh) so anyway then at Pasio I was a bit sad in a way and those brats Danny and Rudy will remind me of you why not married the next day(both laugh)..no you know Brock is Brock to both of us and Gary is my very own twin bro but Trace is just that dumb buffoon(laughs,Mehadi smiles) he just came over here and has stayed no matter what we both actually did to him there and no we certainly weren’t polite ever from first to last and still(both laugh) and then yeah we all love him to the utmost imaginable extent in our subconscious as does he but well it’s universal in Muking dictionary(both laugh) but those things I said even can say to his face the umpteenth time no matter the surroundings only cause it’s that dumb fox(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs) and he is a dad now and Daisy the mom to my sweet little nieces man haven’t been able to see them physically yet you know(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and keeps tendering his hairs),Daisy same they just need each other each moment as much as we do Mehu and Gary and Lillie and Brock and Violet really it’s just Gengar(both smiles at each other ach other very firmly,few moments later),anyhow then after Pasio I just got a grip over myself with my position and all never needed to do Kanto Lance invited and won’t say no to him so back to Lance,so he was saying those but then I just wanted to get out of this uncomfortable situation with a venerable old man,so I said can I just see the Gym Leader’s hall of fame,well before our meeting there I knew via Dave that you were seriously battling when he did Kanto Elite4 then Pulu did Kanto Elite4 when I was at Pasio he wasn’t invited again by you hence extracted newses(both laugh) well Ritch had Kanto first up and then you still weren’t in hall of fame his sources told him for some reason too serious(both laugh) and then you got the hall of fame I knew too via Japp whom I haven’t spoken to you as much my bro as Dave is Dave just directly in family he like Harris stayed a bit apart from Gengarian smoothness(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and tenders his hairs) he too met during undercover is still at Kanto already have won all 6 but beating Lance is hard(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth and keeps tender his hairs) another is Joel he is already in hall of fame bit older he too similar they were the backup team Joel is 6,5 and Japp is 6,5 upto now he also have faced you but didn’t win(laugh) last region was Kanto you used Pilkie,Suicie and Goldy to his Kyurem,Sharpedo and Phione,Goldy just about outlasted Phione always tells Dave would’ve lost had sis been kind to you UNLIKE me(laugh) no they both do call you sis already since that Kalos press itself just realized it as I said Japp was doing Kalos too at the same time as Dave was and did meet me after that press Dave was much more upright Japp was just dissapointed said bro please just stay with us till the end of your career atleast then we’ll see(laugh,Mehadi smiles  oy firmly)..anyway then I knew a bit from them about the gym here and all anyway then back to Lance and his warmth that I was a bit uncomfortable with cause of the personal nature that I didn’t want to recognize so I just said casually without much thoughts that I’ll just like to know the history of Gyms at Cerulean,Frucifern,Bosangria,Pewter and Yellowburst,the 5 closest cities to Pallet in the 11 city circle,so Lance took me to a room,and well I recovered from your memories rather too quickly all the more cause of undercover and all then that incident at Kalos meant that’s it and then came here at Kanto in fullest form and Lance himself said go full blast cause else I wouldn’t have done what I did with referees finally for two months man that was fun(both laugh),Vickie lad and Hannah sis straightaway fled after the first press(both laugh),Fiesta and Bix did meet me just best wishes(both laugh)..they knew one word here and there meant their realtionship which was around 25 years by then anyway(all laugh) would be reproved once more(all laugh) but had I not been given that license I also wouldn’t have done the region that Lance knew too(both laugh)..so by then I saw innumerable of your pictures may be here and there and so on heard many things and as I said even met you physically the day before hardly was more than just a proffeional,Ritch ever told me to patch up and then I said mate you’re making me go crazy then stopped but still told me this and that exactly as Donald,Oliv,Felicia etc did and so I knew this and that about you and yeah Dave always poked me on this(both laugh) Japp and Joel was against you(both laugh) but Penny tried to kill you(both laugh) his trouble is that Sandie too had arguments with him but always left the door unlocked(bursts into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing)..I enquired Sandie later said his Azelf and Glalie were already in to check on me(all laugh) then from outside he says do you want me to break it(all laugh),come in the locks are anyway um..,WOKEN(both brust into laughter)..then said got in and fondled me to death while chiding me why are you not me(both laugh)..man that pest is just your not not male version (frown) BUT IT WOULD’VE BEEN LOCKED AUTOMATICALLY IF IT WERE BESIDE THE BUSHES THAT ARE PICTURESQUE(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..no wonder Sandie is such a gentle person which I wish I could be across the bushes(both laugh) and that little brat Mango Nus too why aunty isn’t laughing just smiling(both laugh)..anyway,then I knew things about you but also knew about innumerable more people like Anabel Hojigela and Melody Sanders(both laugh)..well Belly still says atleast could check on you(both laugh),I said no not even that much patience ever(both laugh) but no you know I just feel bad for Melody cause well she wanted to travel with me at Hoenn meaning the parting day would’ve literally been the most engaging(both laugh) but you know I should’ve been more sympathizing to her she wanted like her cousin or relative not the normal professionalism that Mr Oak prescribed me actually day 0 this term(both laugh),we can never forget that day his final presentation before 1st journey,Gary you are going to go a long way son just go forward,yeah professionally this opinion of yours Ms Dalharst is the biggest blessing for me to see how to personally
keep myself up(both burst into laughter)..Ms Velma Dalharst herself was a one time Kanto conference champ(both laugh) and was 60 then(both laugh)..laughed so much next half in July I go out told me 1 month will return I said oh yeah!challenge(both laugh),said your bro already got 16 steps ahead in HOLISTIC evolutions mind the number too knew about Ms To be Mrs Lillie Oak whole world did(both laugh),the answer is only professionally so personally I’ll get him(both burst into laughter)..that was so much fun with Ms Dalharst ever recall her,during Pasio break told me don’t waste your time if so much is the bonhomie rings are not cheap for Ceruleans atleast(both laugh)..was 64 me 21 retired the year Zevi and Duttie passed officially never formally till Cello and Tunkie finished(both laugh) then still Mango received the comfort he required in the beginning days from his grandma the first two years especially just wish she was there for 2 more months to see first that comeback then most importantly Tyranitar’s full form(both laugh) but yeah fled before due to the challenge(both laugh);did see the Groudon Lady Dawn one though(both laugh) was in full sense even that day to see quite a bit of that match next day even spoke with her then three days later suddenly troubles then the very next day went into abstraction..she is you know ever unforgettable integral grossly as long as this lab stays no matter the time scale in abstraction not quantifiable like all rest in causality from beyond(both smile),anyway then these were going around me the newses of the whole world people I knew closely and so on all knew I knew you too closely(both laugh) so I knew the newses,Sabrina ever said you’re not going to stay single this life(both laugh) and so on,but nothing that reminded me of you meant of any use to me once or twice thought well the new brat must be sweetie then hey(both laugh) then just thought anyway nothing to BEAUTY(both laugh) anyway,then may be I just thought well atleast try to officially know a bit about Cerulean that is only about a particular ponytail that is(both laugh) no really had you came in a ponytail yesterday would’ve been hard for me to take so long to fondle you you know(both laugh) anyway Lance was too sympathetic,it’s just the known section could’ve just shown me but took me to a room to like personally tell me something I don’t know why he did that but um..he didn’t have to..its just the Grace of God,I say..anyhow,first was Pewter and I just hovered over saying that yes that was my very first badge and the leader was very kind to me,well Brock had moved to a different professon,so he didn’t know much,he just said was it Mr Flint Slate,I said no may be someone on the change I forgot his name(both laugh)..yeah he and Daisy both I ever told the whole world what they are Daisy was namecalled he wasn’t(both laugh) and I knew Brock only till the end of Sinnoh(both laugh),Daisy till Johto(both laugh)..well them people knew as travel companions and then as your eldest sis but then Glalie being here was termed just professionality(both laugh),anyway then Lance was about to show Cerulean I just quickly said ok I’ll see Yellowburst first,he showed just Brawn(both laugh) and you know Yellowburst has a tremendous history with electric gym and that’s where I first got the feeling that I was atleast worthy enough to finish this region atleast cause Chu had the material to go alongside me and all and you know all of it first hand..but no Charizard was something as usual in that fly competition against SALAMENCE(both laugh) but then man Pangoro is Pangoro you know what a brat(both laugh)..that was the real flagging off for me never can forget Brock’s face first he heard of my plans(both laugh) anyhow much time spent there,in the meantime a few f.. b..(Mehadi frowns and Seth laughs and says ‘m.. and laughs even more,Mehadi sighs and laughs) were roaming around trying to distract me and I would’ve been absolutely love to oblidge to them and trash talk like I did in all other 6 places but this time I was Graced the third time by God as somehow didn’t like the idea of much crowd that moment and scoffed them off saying I’ll be extremely happy if they spared me for a moment here and let me peacefully to turn back a few pages of memory and I’ll be most pleased to be excused then,which made them a bit flustered including Lance too I guess..given my antics for a long time at after final parties the 6 previous all were vulture bashing all time in crowd(laugh,Mehadi laughs as well),it really was something a bit difficult for them to swallow I knew the Gym histories in other places other times in my own interest and it was just that who was the leader and his way of getting out of the despondency of his sanity and that of his brats(both laughs) but those were not during formal dinners anywhere and well I never went to formal dinners in a formal code of dress though unless it was official(both laugh) which only is in finals of Elite4 that is rather prestigious for the head and you know all was my handmade schedule and all there none that can actually dictate me anymore cause that’s exactly what my brats are starving so much for(both laugh),but those were perfect antics spots to confuse everyone even more so that they think twice before mingling with mepersonally and I have a sway over them,but I never did it unless the Elite4 heads like Lubos and Percy themselves said lets bash(both laugh) which Cynthia didn’t like so excused herself off from it(all laugh) and Unova you know is a mess anyway with 5 man committee having Gabriel the great geologist(all laugh),Mateo the manufacturer of meticulous measurements(all laugh),Patricia the picture perfect pet(both laugh),Marc the Mr Litman anything else(both laugh a lot) and finally Blink the bequeathed broadcaster(all laugh)..so went full on there cause none of them except Patricia are ever sane and she is exactly like Cassey(both laugh) so had tremendous fun there and then ofcourse there’s Ivana(both laugh).. told me to go less else she’s quit(all laugh) so I called a press meet at night(both laugh) and then Pasio was Pasio(both laugh) by the way Ivana had invisible company as you know I ever have had them(both laugh) and this was Reshiram(laughs,Mehadi brusts into laughter) yeah that was something(both laugh) with Raikou,Entei,Heatran,Groudon,Dialga,Tryrantum,Terrakion,Arceus,Regigigas,Cobalion and ofcourse Guzzlord(laugh,Mehadi brusts into laughter)..yeah can be exactly here all together right now except me none can detect,anyway(both laugh)..only Mr Oak can most cases for all brats Sabrina will be for Gengy and Sablie too thus unless they want to go to higher levels same will be for you too(both laugh),but anyway,Lance also did say go full blast only then did I agree to do Kanto to begin with(both laugh) and no never would to that much extent as he’s a man I respect as much as Professor Oak,anyhow,then I said even a more bitter thing to the vultures saying,I’ve known Lance for 22 years by now and if also they left him with me for a few moments I’ll be most pleased and I’ll also be extremely happy if I’m allowed a little bit of solitude away from the protracted glamour that comes from going through the whole world constantly for 23 years without a break through undercovers as well and lately without a break from public glare,then my tired body and mind could be much relieved and then I’ll later some other day may be able to entertain them more thoroughly,which dispersed them off from us completely,Lance was taken aback a bit but must’ve thought just the memories of my very first Gym Badges reminded me of my very first teenage travel days..cause by then I read a bit of gym leaders rules and said ‘bro,did you know there’s 5000 other ways too for spelling the word Gym?(both laugh)..leader I see ilii to start and hr to end(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..what type of gym?..water..what type of water..unmoist salty tears(Mehadi laughs uncontrollably)..I see,yeah right recalled Sandshrew’s nails can’t stay intact for long in moist water(Mehadi laughs uncontrollably)..excellent in ponds though(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..um,sir..um(Mehadi laughs)..get off you buffoon do you think I’m an idiot,tell your brat to tunnel under the pond bed(Mehadi laughs uncontrollably)..sir!sir! That gym isn’t behaving properly..too many cheerleaders,I see(Mehadi laughs)..what type is it?..underground grass(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..hmm,can’t a Swellow work there(Mehadi laughs)..um..sir,Swellow in grass gym,isn’t that a dark type(Mehadi bursts into laughter)..no deep blue(Mehadi laughs uncontrollably)..and yeah about the cheerleaders,just tell them to replace with Jynx(Mehadi bursts into laughter)’..and I went to hall of fame water gyms with Donphan and Tauros but no Metapod(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..”
Mehadi(laughing) : “ ‘hey namecall which forsaken City(both burst into laughter)..sir I expect a more fomal language(both laugh)..I see,formal language..university ground?(both bursts into laughter)..sir I’m sorry I’m from Cerulean City Gym a water gym with both pool and ocean water system..hmm..I see,but I think you’re being illegal cause in such a case the smell difference affects the battle(both bursts into laughter)..sir,I’ve to go urgency(both bursts into laughter)..right,but don’t forget the washrooms are paid(both laugh uncontrollably)..”
Seth(laugh) : “some system these are..anyhow so Lance rather was happy and thanked me for driving the crowd away,then I told him with a bit of irritation to show me the damn Bosangria(both laugh) that was to have fun(both laugh)..then he said as usual I said well I’ll bet some fortune there(both laugh)..then I said well I heard there’s a bit of trouble at Frucifern as the gym is defunct now leader expelled I heard what about it..well I knew about the trouble but didn’t know it was about you I just thought might be just internal skirmishes I knew all your moods like you after all if too Gyaradosy(both laugh)..Martie,Pullie,Junnie(both laugh) yeah still same name as was so ever(both laugh) and the brat too(both laugh),Steller(both laugh)..man some couple these two are(both laugh),Lukie(both laugh) and Astrid all did tell me that the gym now is annexed with your gym and you were overworking and all once or twice after that trouble I brushed it aside saying how may I help cause I was already(both laugh)..anyway,then Lance told yeah a bit of a trouble but will understand it more as we go through Cerulean(both laugh) said cause it’s just annexed now and all so I said yeah alright then told Lance to tell me about Cerulean history first(both laugh) and said I now have time but later want to go to a solitary place after that to have a conversation with you privately(both laugh)..so Lance realized I’m not at all interested about it(both laugh),so to bore me out even quickly this godforsaken Cerulean’s whole damn history of a bit more than 1000 years yet approximating to keep the vigil like a black coffee(Mehadi laughs loudly)..(laugh)..anyway(both laugh)..was spat at my face from point blank(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter) and I just patiently bore a bit from 1000 to 900 just like Gyarados(Mehadi bursts into more laughter) but quickly lost patience and asked him how’s the Gym doing now with the hall of fame and annexed gym and all,and that Cerulean was my second badge and I was lucky to get that badge(smile and tenders Mehadi) so very lucky indeed..”
Mehadi(smile,tendering Seth) : “mutually in all ways,continue” Seth(smile) : “and then I continued,as by then somehow your thoughts kept pouring down on me so torrentially for no reason I don’t know why but now do it was just me(both smile)..so with all that I just said I personally knew the Sensational Sisters there too except the current gym leader and how are they doing? So Lance told about Daisy a bit and Lillie too and Violet whole world knows Jampa too(both laugh) and well then I said,and how is the gym leader doing too I understand she being once my travel companion didn’t want to face me not privately(both laugh)..if they get that match in official records I’ll send Gengleye to Lance too(both laugh) and the gym well none will say a word when that brat Glalie re-entres(both laugh) with GROUDON(both laugh) told me even yesterday during all those hard moments for you that master brat she is sleeping now later crying and all but actually it’s not spontaneous then is it rather analytic temporally(both burst into laughter)**


,anyway(both laugh) so back at Lance then I said,but that’s ok that she didn’t face me but except that how’s she didn’t seem to be too eager to have a chat yesterday..Lance might’ve got me there that it’s exactly that particular gym leader who was bugging me cause the gym leader was my travel companion for longest during that type of age and was not male(both laugh) which my bunch and me don’t at all agree with cause he’s too sweetie(both laugh) anyway,about knowing you they never stopped linking us really after the Kalos press all saying surely it’s Ms Waterflower only I said already Ketchumed 23 long years back just reinvigorating at this ending youth(both laugh),anyway about Lance well with this being said by me,then he might’ve guessed that and thought may be the reason for my sudden stern behaviour with people cause surely he knew we were married for 23 years at 23(both laugh) and thus he guessed it that it was this thing not being which I was doing what I was doing as told by Gengy(both laugh) but Lance very kindly ordered everyone that may we not be disturbed at all for a few minutes and the place was emptied,then he told me about you and the Hall of Fame induction and all in brief and I listened and realized well your professional life is going well atleast and then I asked well I saw her yesterday and she’s been inducted just a couple of months ago did only last month full as a hall of famer but didn’t seem exactly happy or other people’s reaction too wasn’t exactly normal I thought is everything alright Lance said no she is rather busy in these days some personal problems she has told me so much concerned about it hence a bit unmindful that’s all the gym is great and only been a month refused you but did allow Mrs Nancy Turnbull Charles in(both laugh) I said yeah who elaborated all of it twice to me already cause as you know my family just a veil of professionality(laughs,Mehadi smiles) here so I was a bit surprized as to why would anyone want to shield herself after getting the tag cause it makes no sense to do so after first agreeing to accept it second not agreeing to relinquish it,and you were so new in the hall of fame you got that in December and this was May starting so anyhow Lance finished and I just said if I could have a look at her official interview record cause that’s kept for a year,he said no the leader couldn’t come just sending her written consent just formality,then I said well isn’t it strange given she was in sensational sisters as well and was a huge name too as I heard later(both laugh),Lance said yeah she was a huge name there and did many things to Cerulean basically she is inseparable to Cerulean what it is by all means really even outside profession and Pewter has due to her received much attention that it never did before due to continuous troubles with authority for like 322 years(both laugh) I said well yeah I’ve heard all these first hand cause she is my wife(both laugh) but it’s strange that suddenly so much shielding so I said I felt as you said that the leader is busy for some very serious reasons as well may be personally otherwise why would one want to shield herself after getting in hall of fame to begin with and just then he drove the first Knell in my heart saying well you’re right the current leader has joind the Frucifern City gym with her Gym and now it serves a dual role so just that,I said yeah I heard that there was a trouble too but I’ve by then had travelled 1377 gyms this case is the most rare and if I saw a gym like this I wouldn’t receive the second badge that was added cause then I had to face the leader twice in same gym that hindered my schedule of broadening the horizon(both laugh) for the brats(both laugh)..well Unova they would’ve seriously injured the opponent in 2nd match for being below substandard and in Kalos would’ve made them mad for boring them(both laugh),well this isn’t new but I certainly didn’t see them in Kanto 11 years back when I toured 72 gyms just after my official marriage privately(both laugh) hall of fame all that is too including my wife(both laugh) but this situation I saw in Unova and Kalos as well as in Sinnoh but all were due to marital reasons everywhere barring may be one or two but they were just temporary for some complications and all but still it was just that you will get two badges if you so want from any of the gyms and only a 1st nomination holder can do it among any of the two so I thought well given your mood and all and the fact that my infatuated compeers here stopped talking about you especially the Frucifern brats all together that by then I thought you might’ve got married and all but I didn’t want to directly ask that cause(both laugh) I knew I wasn’t the other half(both laugh) no Mehu I’ve had all ideas in the very first day after break-up I was assured of myself cause I didn’t know these parts of you this clearly due to my emotions that you were my wife since first day that was it for me nothing more this term atleast but I knew you needed your husband you can’t stay single at all your nature isn’t like that hence I actually felt bad with all these then that given our relationship how will it work but the illusion is I didn’t understand that Mehu is thinking the same cause my own thoughts are same as we’re(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth tendering his hairs) and yeah as I told you and you and me both realize I would still be fine with Zeky atleast(both laugh) and would’ve despite me cause had I given them the leeway for instance Zekrom herself you know whole world knows each of my brats and Zekrom too and what she was during undercover too(both laugh) ravaged my nevers each day all time why would the opponent not present more difficulties in ideology(both laugh) opponent was she herself(both laugh) so now given them they are only waiting for me to cast their confinement of being off and go abstract which I know since day 1 cause I want that and you’re the one who doesn’t cause you want that version out of it to have fun a bit and hence we are soulmates and no we both have had our issues and mistakes during Unova hence truly it’s a play Mehu nothing more(both smile at each other,few moment later),anyway then after Lance said the joint gym and still running for 2 years now I just was a bit startled cause these issues takes may be 1 year atmost to get sorted and all so said,well that must be nerve wrecking work first and second why in the world the gym hasn’t restared properly at Frucifern given Harris son was certainly good enough to get out of Grass(both laugh) his medicine is VIRIZ(laugh,Mehadi burst into laughter)..yeah I always say this Brenda yet to know(both laugh) anyway,so I say this to which Lance’s face did turn a bit concerned but you know you can’t talk about these things with anybody no matter what your personal relationship is,so Lance just said she manages it and her name and all meant it was alright to keep two gyms at one we just don’t want another Bosangria 230 km off(both laugh)..so I said well then is it like Saturday first half open Lance said with additional hour added each day having the Frucifern gym totally shut now only official and other works go on there so I was scared actually when he said 8:15-18:30 for 5 days then 8:15-12:30 on Saturday for 2 years by now so then I directly asked Lance that if it were so that the two married and one changed the profession cause I’ve Frucifern badge was a hall of fame during my Kanto travels at Frontier was my very first badge after I started now 12 long years back it was hall of fame then and the leader then was 67,Mr Jerry Jefferson and he isn’t anymore among us sadly for 8 long years now that I know too cause one of my good friends live there and had some contacts in the gym that was Junnie lad(both laugh) then I said look I know Jerry uncle since I just started to go to the gym cause he was great friends with Professor knew everything about my dad and knew my grandpa and grandma too very well and I didn’t want to visit his gym cause I had too much respect for his calm and serene personality had a few unofficial matches but then on his last month himself told me to come I was much honoured that was very first month of my Frontier 13 years back it saddens me to see the gym in this state after just these few years so is it something like that with the next one and thus made it a single facility Cerulean being second category nomination cause I heard a few troubles beween the two may be it was just that(both laugh),to which Lance rather laughed and said well I wasn’t informed of the invitation atleast(both laugh), then said no the leader there Mr Andrum(laugh,Mehadi too laughs)..man what a time the brat has had with GitiCozy and Gengleye(both laugh)..anyway said he is distant nephew in relation,just relinquished it after being beaten by her in a battle,I got more interested cause I thought it might’ve just been a personal thing cause that type of battle is illegal bing not of that type(both laugh) and so I said the same that is that legal,to which he said that it won’t be possible for him to tell me that as that’ll be against his code of conduct,I thought well it might be a shadowy game with performance enhancers and all and you of all people with illegal things I couldn’t believe it and so a bit desparately said that look Lance you know me and I know you what is it then Lance just solemnly said no we consented cause Ms Mehadi Waterflower not Mr Mehadi though(both laugh) was personally tormented rather and had to take this step cause didn’t want to get to the courts as the bet was if
she loses she will be demoted to 1st category whereas the opposition is propelled to it and hence the illegality was not caused by her but rather the opposite was,we consented cause if he lost he would’ve had to surrender his license for next 5 years and will be banned with bunch snatched away for the same number of years except the starter who still can’t be battled and must be kept with the bunch which only your lab has but actually had cause after that night he is going to be relased soon,bunch already has returned(both laugh),told the people there that why waste 5 years compeers if one night can do so for quite a few lives(both laugh) they asked did he harm you said worse as usual the sanity(both laugh) so will be released cause was bed ridden next exact 5 days cause the brats weren’t kind at all(both laugh) yeah they can determine that too how much to push people by determining how much not to at my cost(laugh,Mehadi smiles at Seth)..anyway as Lance was talking about this I had a feeling that it was about me which had riled you up that much so I was a bit concerned and your ever-pouring thoughts by then had taken a bit of a toll on me and this just put the fire in the heystack once Lance said your outside profession career created a myth about you that never did much help to you in your personal life atleast he felt..I said well that might be true but you know it seems to me that you’re rather dissapointed than angry which would’ve been the case accroding to my ideas of your personality cause that’s just irresponsibility from the leader to not tell you to stop people intruding her personal life in the name of profession and all which sometimes happened that I heard I have many friends at the 11 city circle who doesn’t have a very high opinion of her personal life as I’ve heard a few times from my lab colleagues as well like Dr Skechit(both laugh) and this was my thought as you see from Unova itself and all still had that idea why would the difference persist(both laugh) so spewed that out being not at all shrew(both laugh) then Lance said no she just never complained rather her eldest sister did once 3 years back but Mehadi withdrew it saying it was not a trouble it’s ok DaisyDaisyl is rather old now(both laugh)..man what in the world that fox was doing then for 2 years(both laugh)..”
Mehadi(laugh) : “hiding behind the chairs at Blue's without even that wink(both burst into laughter)..that brat said,um..well..but she too can..um..I mean..(both laugh)”
Seth(laugh) : “man Mehu these we ever said then said you’re my best friend(both laugh)..anyway,then Lance just was dissapointed and said just too nice a person then I just laughed at him saying please Lance I’ve seen many martyr’s it’s rather foolishness not courage you know way more than me what is it that this little issue can get so big that it is now a concern for me as well cause I have to live there being a hall of fame gym not Yellowburst(both laugh)..he just became grave and said I personally suspect she is going the way your big sis was deluded into and once he said that I understood what it meant to you in reality hearing what brats were saying verbally since Kanto itself and thus in reply Mehu as usual I instantly said HAKAMO-O(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter),cause the only thing I recalled was my sweet Mehu flower first telling me way back in Pasio 2nd year 19 years back after she picked up her name being extremely good that,’um..Seth today..um..they linked you with me I just laughed them off but if this goes on..’,I said why bother Mehu we know what we are then you said no it’s not that Seth it hurts me,I said well my sobriety only(both laugh) you just smiled and as usual was so sweetly in my arms(both giggle)..but realized that Mehu your life was being questioned like that whereas it was just a few vultures reminding me that I have  to acknowledge my wife’s psychophysical HUMAN form(both laugh) like the human himself most(both laugh)..so that was what got aggravated more during Unova and then I was in illusion but with this I realized it cause Sabrina’s trouble was this condition exactly somehow her serenity and intuitions didn’t match the normal life and all and she then with Haunter understood it’s rather through fun and games the path is easier much so she is what she is now and was as ever my sweet big sis but that character of her and you are nowhere near neither you nor me are morally and spiritualy nowhere near as high as she is hence I realized your trouble isn’t what her trouble was the wrong things of existential infinity having put up a curtain in-front of her but your problem was gross your life was being snatched away and that was cause all you wanted ever was a husband who will understand your deep rooted sweet nature of unfathomable longing for yourself actually not so much outside just that you want a channel from outside to express that hence your soulmate is me as I want to destroy the difference yet keep my individuality hence I need Mehu flower each moment and the viseversa so I just had the protype of this idea and got extremely angry that grand then once a skillful person wishes a peaceful life she isn’t going to get it and I knew what you are no matter our relations so thought well it’s hideous stuff really that the city itself is killing off it’s jewel by all means and all actually that was just my anger on myself for having left you like that and this was the first taste of that and was only going to get more pungent and did the next moment so this I realized then that it’s as if the whole world was waiting for me to get out of their path to treat my sweetie as shuttle cock whereas the match was about her stardom and I was incensed and exactly then I recalled what I was saying nothing to beauty and all and what it meant to you and what that would been certainly then 5 years later and within so I just lost it and straightaway said what I totally forgot in the preceeding 5 years in a way as to your name as I said became synonymous to any so and so and hence I never bothered despite newses coming in my ears even Frucifern,pictures being visible to me,even Oliv once solemnly telling me your psychic states aren’t ok I said just like you proximately(both laugh) so she just sighed and said best wishes(both laugh) and so on then I just got even more angry thinking you were there just a day before why I just didn’t press you enough cause your trouble at Unova needed my brats now it will need just a 1 full minute press conference to just upend the Kalos one editted(both laugh) anyway this made me incensed and so I directly said,look Lance,Mehadi was my girlfriend for 18 long years after which we broke-up and yeah she was my girfriend from almost the first sight at 17 infact we confessed to each other in the very first week at Zipgarnet Forest itself about simultaneously(both laugh) and before first sight she saved me in that forest lake from the possible drowning and so..(laugh) here here here..(bursts into laughter)..”
Mehadi(bit irritated) : “What now,Seth?” Seth(laugh,squeezing Mehadi’s cheeks,Mehadi frowns,Seth laughs even more) : “so sweetie my flower when angry(giggle,Mehadi frowns,laugh)..just the vultures Mehu I can see them so eagerly waiting to land on this spot that has suddenly become visible to them(laugh)-the vultures are insinuating that I’m with my childhood dream who saved my life and brought me back to life- oh! Her beautiful face,oh! Her sweet..” Mehadi(sigh) : “Seth,I know how much these thoughts disturbed you,but hey we’re married now,do you have to validate yourself even now” Seth(laugh) : “no really Mehu if you want you can prepare yourself to see in men that is me all stool and..” Mehadi(loud voice,frown) : “Seth!just shut up!I’m your wife!stop this..” Seth(laugh) : “no really it’s so funny that childhood dream stuff..” Mehadi( oy very firmly and smiling at him) : “Seth is my dream for eternity not any form just me is Seth..(both smiles at each other)...” Seth(laugh,few moments later) : “though ask Brock for the answer on vulturized questions(Mehadi frowns)..no it was only the first round,today even more Dialga Dilaga/Dialga Dialga Count Dialga don’t be a gambler just finish up your meal/with each bite do recall it’s going to satisfy your hunger defined only as that FEEL(uncontrollably laughs  ehadi,Mehadi laughs a lot shaking her head and tenders Seth)..HEY!OH KETCHUM KETCHUM PLAY/NO RENSOL EXCUSE NO YOU NAY(Mehadi UN..)/NO KETCHUM DON’T DEFER SAYING YOU’RE TODAY TOO GAY/OH KETCHUM KETCHUM SAY!(uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..anyhow(both laugh a lot)..man Dashing Crook is just that(both laugh)..you lost,JUST LET IT LIVE ONLY IN THAT FEEL(both un..),anyway(both laugh..lot)..man that has been doing the rounds for 24 years full now never will get old..JUST LET IT LIVE ONLY IN THAT FEEL(both un..saying DASHING ROCK),as I was saying that the answer is no,because I didn’t exactly think she was pretty or sane then(Mehadi laughs)..cause she is my sweetie(hugs Mehadi very firmly smiling at her)...” Mehadi(smile,tendering Seth’s hairs) : “especially now(both broadly smile)” Seth(smile) : “right.so basically I didn’t put any thought at all to her,rather she followed me..this one done”
Mehadi(smile) : “right!back to Lance”
Seth(smile) : “right,so I said,it was just extremely strong the yearning between us for no reason since the first sight almost hence she was my girlfriend from almost the first sight but me her hubby since exactly from then(both laugh) and since then we had had our relationship but broke-off long ago but it feels extremely irritating to me even now cause she is a nice person no matter what went between us and this I saw first hand ages back at Pasio when they linked us up discretely after I went there straightaway after my first title and then later all the more due to her name as an extremely talented up and coming water gym leader then too much at Johto where she stunned everyone with whole water bunch in general training just didn’t progress in the final cause you’ve faced Mr Paul Pecnil himself a real hardman just my Pulu dear(both laugh) and we used to laugh at them denying and enjoy it later during our personal times(both laugh) with the jackal lurking to crook it always(both laugh) so it just feels bad as if her stardom and all has harassad her so much even then and still doing and all and I guess she still is a very kind gym leader else none would do the extra day and still all this she faces which was one of the reasons why we broke off as well clash of egoes..attitude(squeezes Mehadi’s cheeks then Mehadi does same and then both laugh)..so I said,I’ll just be happy to know if she is married now or not cause 17 years and off certainly hurt me a lot then same was for her I guess so just curious as to if this is about these or not for her again,then Lance said as far as he knew no she wasn’t,but by then as you see your bug had smitten me beyond repair(both laugh)..privately(both giggle and hug)..and so after I knew the status of eternally Mehadi Mehu Waterflower Ketchum(both laugh) I just straightaway but unknowingly said if I could see her picture(both laugh),I’ll be um.. very happy..(both laugh)..he by then realized what is what(both laugh) cause none asks to show a random stranger who is an Elite4 head and 26 years older at 66 to show the questioner his former girfriend’s picture with whom he doesn’t have any contact at all for 5 long years by then(both laugh) so he showed me your picture in a room and prudently left the room just after just leaving me there excusing himself of urgencies and mentioning a person to guard the door and except for him not to allow absolutely anyone no matter who..and Mehu that was prudence otherwise I wasn’t in a stable mood and my chu-bro realizes me well even with human emotions cause of his long companionship with me constant and all of it is that he has to protect me(both laugh),so if then I did something of a physical skirmish and then they bettered me obviously and I felt physical threat and despondency,Chu-bro would’ve literally thunder chaired the whole world and he would’ve himself set upon all my other Pokemons present on everyone..and I had Palkia to start with(both laugh),they’ll get absolutely mad if I die before them due to other persons or pokemons and they have to see that then none will spare themselmsevs and you know what their power is if they are in that mood- so yeah that’s true prudence and anyhow I’m the biggest name in
Pokemon world now anyway due to Tyranitar’s status out of it(both laugh) so there’ll not be a more important man in that building anyhow unless from general government who were there as it was built up as my very last match(both laugh) and we did chat and all but I said well I’ll meet them later today I’m a bit emotional sorry(both laugh) they realized I want privacy and even to them could say this meant I’m the most heinous brat existing(both laugh) but none could say a word cause all knew the hall was infested with ghosts(both laugh)..so anyway,still great prudence..anyhow I kept gazing at your picture that I didn’t want to see in the last 5 years despite seeing,it was 5 years ago but that was really by then even more heart wrecking to me as I recalled 5 years back we still were together and yeah that was during my Unova finals month when I did 18 gyms and hence didn’t speak with you only my sweet little Chompy(both laugh) and that was your 2nd special nomination and yeah we didn’t talk then but still I had Mehu without illusion then(both smiles at each other in same pose)..anyhow more than these I just kept gazing at your picture..and I just couldn’t leave it or take my eyes off and unknowingly tears came to my eyes..it was a full sized picture,you with a V pose and I just touched the V you made in the pose,that picture was a older one from then too I realized cause your disposition was very happy there which wasn’t the case in that month atleast I knew or the previous two but these things were just..just to take me into the more depths of your torrential thoughts downpouring on me and well it was a big sized picture but I brought itvdown Via Noivern and told him to hold it right in front of me and as he did I touched your handmade the V and just kept staring ,and Pikachu just kept staring at you and looking at me..and those goddamn vultures if were there..those bufoons..godforsaken..”
Mehadi(frown) : “Seth,you truly have become a pest(Seth laughs,laugh),..Seth..why drag vultures such beautiful description,I need to tutor you for long..”
Seth(laugh) : “coach,remember Massey at that water contest?” Mehadi(frown) : “what’s so funny about that?” Seth(burst into laughter) : “Mehu!Mehu!Mehu!Mehu! Still won’t let anyone to say hi to me right?” Mehadi(frown and scowl) : “what was that Seth?” Seth(laughing) : “ ‘Ah!you saved my Pokemon,I always loved this type of brave and kind man,we need to discuss our future,are you free in the evening..a date?’ |’um..excuse me but he’s BOOKED’|”says who?”|”ME,MIS-TY”|”ah!Mis- ty!are you his girlfriend?|”blush and flustered,um..no..um..I’m his coach”|” Mehadi(smile) : “you still remember,it was I guess 20 years back?” Seth(smile,poem) : “the very first sight Mehadi her name/the heavenly flower with only one claim/that me and she are one and same/soully ever you Mehu,just call me by your name” Mehadi(giggling, oy firmly,Seth also hugs Mehadi firmly and smiles) : “Hum..beeing on poems now my sweet sweet bee(both laughs)?” Seth(smile) : “for my flower talk(both laughs)... I went to Cerulean for my second badge with my travel companion Mehadi/15 years little girl always wanted me to obey Mehadi/fooling around,fake fighting all to make me know Mehadi/finally Cerulean turned out the yougest Gym leader is Mehadi/she would fight me with a face so cute in anger to tell me she’s Mehadi/after that still followed me cause a bike owned by Mehadi/later my girlfriend the ever sweet flower Mehadi/but now I know no words just YOU’RE MY SOUL-MY Mehadi ”(looking at Mehadi who was beaming,both keep ach other firmly beaming at each other)…
(song,immitating,Mehadi’s goodbye song) Goodbye But now that’s such a hard thing to say Now it’s time to let go But I never thought I’d feel this way
Promise not to be sad
But we both knew I was lying
Gotta fight back the tears
‘Cause, can’t let you see me crying
You’re more than just my best friend
(smile,shivering voice)
What makes me Mehadi most of all
In our final curtain call
Is knowing that I won’t see you again (tears..little)” Mehadi(little tears, oy tightly,smile,whisper) : “Seth,I’m just here why bring that..” Seth(wipes off his tears, ehadi firmly,smiling at her) : “um..very sorry sweetie,disturbed the mood..but(smile)..still heart wrenching..but (smile)..finally...um..(laugh)...finally I’ve got the answer to all vultures that dared to write this and that deluded me to be away from Mehu for 4 years...(tears,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly,smiles at him)..um,it’s ok..anyhow I’ll describe…
(song immitating but even before start flustered)..(very stern)..just a sec Mehu..(Mehadi a bit concerned)...just a sec..(extremely stern and grave,Pikachu is suddenly out of sleep very alert and grave as if he also has experienced something very pungent and dangerous)...( ehadi firmly)..just..just give me a moment..
Mehadi( oy firmly,solemn) : “Seth,your Mehadi is your wife now,your soul,you yourself are your Mehadi,we were just having fun..come on Seth,the by gones are by gones..please..Seth..” Seth(very stern as if some memory playing in his mind and he’s trying to totally devastate them once for all, ehadi firmly,shivering but firm and low voice) : “yes,that’s the thing..but I recalled no its just a thought..a possibility..a chance..a unit of web of complex thoughts that eithermakes or breaks one..just a moment Mehu,please bear with me..Pikachu sleep,not a trouble..
(Pikachu goes back and keeps looking at Seth intensely.)...all those days in Kalos libraries at night time only me,chu-bro and Ganger the rest of the world never knew...would pick up the few books...sit go to an empty space turn the lights on..study while those two play..life and death,fooling around and crying abound,eternal bliss perpetual gloom side by side..amusing is the result begotten..everfree,evereffulgant,evercontent..that’s actually what actualized and established my intuitive and abstract conviction...but this vulture..I’ve probably didn’t cook carefully..(smile)..no I get it now...(laugh,grin)..I get it now..no damn vulture can pass me,my soul...lets play then..(grin)..lets play..
Mehadi(solemn, oy tightly,keeping her head on his chest) : “Seth..for me please stop it..we will go to Yellowburst Lake tomorrow..just you and I..and no it won’t be a goodbye..you are your Mehadi you know that,we’re soulmates Seth,just brush this one aside..for eternity they can’t separate us..nothing is their except us..it’s all our own fooling around play...we’re ONE just an illusion as being two/i want to see me to have me as only being you..remember..please Seth..” Seth(stern,smile) : “yeah Mehu,I’m sorry that I’m giving you more pain..but please just this one,it’s very dangerous if this damn brat remains...(laugh)..now I recall…
(song immitating)
I close my eyes and I can see the day we met, Just one moment and I knew: You’re my best friend, do anything for you.
We’ve gone so far and done so much And I feel like we’ve always been together.
Right by my side through thick and thin, You’re the part of my life I’ll always remember.
The time has come,
It’s for the best, I know it.
Who could have guessed that you and I – Somehow, someday, we’d have to say goodbye.
(bursts into laughter,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly tears..) Mehadi(tears) : “Seth,you’re making me cry..why suddenly..” Seth(wipes Mehadi’s tears off  er firmly) : “I’ve got it Mehu,finally..(bursts into laughter but shivering voice,tears)..death,huh?!?..death..physical death,social death,emotional death,mental death..and contacts...that is also death..(laugh)..the vultures so sweet they thought this would be untenable,unshakable,unbeatable,unbearable...IMPOSSIBLE..(bursts into laughter and tears,Mehadi cries  oy)...(very stern,firm but shivering low voice,tears)..don’t cry Mehu,nothing but us..and this is my answer. To those dam brats...( ehadi very firmly)…

(Pikachu intently looking at Seth,Seth exhausted of emotion,shivering still  ehadi firmly..Mehadi stopped crying looking at Seth with a broad smile, oy)...just a sec Mehu,that was only the first..those brats..I will finish it now more radically…
I’m impossible to describe as you see so is my Mehadi/I’m impossible to comprehend as you see so is my Mehadi/I’m impossible to fathom as you see so is my Mehadi/I’m impossible just I’m and I’m my Mehadi/I’m me and that’s Me,yes as my Mehadi/i’m now Seth Ketchum thus also my Mehadi/this all is what it is I and my Mehadi/It’s the same what am I,is that I’m my Mehadi/I’m here bounded detached but I’ve my Mehadi/I’ll play what I’m as will my Mehadi/again and again if here is me and my Mehadi/this is this as what is me and my Mehadi/difference in unimaginability still me and my Mehadi/doesn’t matter what is there,reality is me and my Mehadi/this all is what it is I and my Mehadi/It’s the same what I’m,is that I’m my Mehadi.
And finally I’ve got the higher radicalized version..you know just goes on infinity level in radicalization,just a piece(Mehadi beams,Seth smile at her and both hug each other firmly) Ever present ever existent,I’m what I’m/my name you said Seth Ketchum,but I’m what I’m/not bounded by my body or the mind or even the soul/i’ve got nothing to say,cause nothing can describe my soul/i’ve got nothing to do,nothing to be,nothing to rue/i know who what I’m,forever free,free from rue/the only way to realize me,is who you call Mehadi/I’m that,I’m that,just take a look, I am Mehadi”
(Seth smiles at Mehadi, er very firmly..Mehadi beams at Seth, oy very firmly...they hug each other for a few minutes)
(Mehadi SINGS HUMMING WHISPER) Mehadi(humming, oy firmly,Seth is also  ehadi firmly,both smiling at each other) :
“
Goodbye
But now that’s such an easy thing to say Now it’s time to let go But I ever knew I’d feel the joyous way Promise not to be sad But we both knew I was lying
Gotta fight back the joy
‘Cause,I don’t want to show my playing You’re my Own Being…
(smile,tears,Seth  ehadi very firmly and smiling at her,Mehadi  oy very firmly,whispering,singing the rest of the song in Seth’s ears) What makes me Mehadi all and all In my soul and my all
Is that I’m Seth forever,
again and again…
(smile,tears,Seth also smiles and tears rolling down his cheeks,Seth and Mehadi ach other very firmly)..”
(Seth and Mehadi stay ach other firmly smiling at each other for a long time) Seth(smile) : “Our Final goodbye,for this time,as usual..what’s up in next one(smiles)?” Mehadi(smile) : “First we’ll be ONE and ONE and then for your next part I’m your Pikachu(both smiles)”
Seth(finally laughing) : “but I won’t be your Godly(both bursts into laughter)..” Mehadi(smiling) : “why suddenly Seth?” Seth(smile) : “no you know what I was just running through what I told you during our dating session at noon(both laughs)..just recalled I go way away and you get frustrated and so move way away with those who won’t go away...(bursts into laughter)..what a night this(laugh,Mehadi smiles)...then I recalled what I read once..contact,contact,contact..(laugh,Mehadi smiles)..you know Mehu(laugh)..I just should’ve said the the day you were singing the vulture version of the one you sweetly sang,so beautiful(Mehadi laugh and then beams at Seth)..that I remember what I read that day...’where’s contact if there’s only you?’...then I realized that I’m Mehadi and that’s it so that..but you went ahead..” Mehadi(smile) : “yeah,that is what it is Seth,I realized you were desparate to say ever no matter what...so I said I or you-death doesn’t matter,yeah I don’t want the pain but(beams) just doesn’t matter(smiles)..I’m Seth and that’s it...”(both hug each other firmly smiling at each other)…
Seth(smile) : “but still you know I don’t like this heart-wrenching it’s rather inevitibility to me..why bother when unison is ultimately what you want?” Mehadi(smile) : “you can only have the highest heart-wrenching if you do have had or are established in the very unison only Seth,it’s just a play you know the end..” Seth(smile) : “absolutely..I’ve always thought about this death,death,death,rather frustrating..thanks Mehu,certainly very clear now( ehadi firmly)” Mehadi(smile, oy firmly) : “as usual”...(they stay ach other and smiling at each other for some time)…
Seth(smile) : “yeah once souled ever souled” Mehadi(smile) : “soully true”...(they again stay ach other and smiling at each other for some time) Seth(laugh) : “now finally I want to roast that goodbye crap(both laugh)..cause I really want to go everywhere with it..(both smile)..by the way all this and more to come forever at 15..had to smack each other(both bursts into laughter)..
here it is->
(immitating)
I close my eyes and I can see the day we met once more, Just one moment and I knew: You’re my soulmate,I’m nothing but you.
We’ve gone so far again doing so much And that’s just again as we’ve always done together.
Right by my soulmate, playing through always, You’re all of my being as I laugh at the word remember.
The time has come,
It’s just to take a break,I know it.
It’s time to pack up this one..
for the return to next bit,where I’ll fool you the first time..
(both smiles)...( ehadi) yes,death is laughed off but so is life cause it was already said that after death anyhow ONE..so rather useless is both life and death,mere wordplay..but being what we are,alive,lets play(both smile at each other)..but you know next time I should always say I’m booked(both bursts into laughter)..am I wrong?” Mehadi( oy,smile) : “who should answer?” Seth(solemn) : “Mehu,I wish I could understand..” Mehadi(looking at Seth and showing her ring,smile) : “Seth,I’ve this now remember,as usual?” Seth(smile) : “just I could say those words you said,’I’m booked’,but I just didn’t want to create a fuss.. that’s all you know but then..nah! Let it go,vulture business(both laughs)” Mehadi(smile) : “right Seth,remember my name,but Ah!your ring I..” Seth(smile,showing her another ring) : “just a second Mehadi(putting it aside,Mehadi looks a bit surprized)..you were talking about coming with me to Unova,regardless of whether I go or not keeping in mind the hellrounds and your dreams what if the everything you want is refused intentionally(smiles at Mehadi looking into her eyes)..” Mehadi(a bit shocked looks into Seth’s eyes,then a bit dejected,then a few moments later broadly smiles again looking into Seth’s eyes and  im very firmly) : “yes,your final filter Seth,I understand,yeah..(hides her face into Seth’s chest  im very firmly,Seth keeps smiling at her)..it’s fine dear,just fine,yeah I won’t be happy if I look at that in the first few years from today may be but Seth(looks into Seth’s eyes smiling,Seth too looks into Mehadi’s eyes smiling)..I just want you dear that’s all-only and soully(hugs Seth very firmly and hides her face in Seth’s chest broadly smiling)..” Seth(smiling at Mehadi finally hugs her very firmly) : “sweet Mehu flower,soully(both keep ach other for few minutes)..that can come only if there’s body what if we surpass that level along with the mental level hum..won’t that be most lunatic and fully maddening..(smiles looking at Mehadi as Mehadi too looks at Seth smiling)..” Mehadi(smiling at Seth and looking into his eyes,both same pose ach other very firmly) : “always with you ever with you and yeas my wish also matches Seth,I wanted to kiss your head off since the very 2nd day and do that each day umpteenth times and later when you used to return after 2 years,I didn’t want to stop that whenever I saw you..but Seth(looking into Seth’s eyes broadly smiling,Seth too broadly smiles looking into isty’s eyes,both same pose)..just as I went close to you since day one it’s just..it ever felt that any physical adoration wasn’t enough to express my feelings towards you it was so overwhelming and just lost myself in that in your presence and forgot all just didn’t want to do anything except   you and keep   you for eternity and that really was it..now I know it’s all cause it’s just me im Seth..I can’t express my soul that is Seth..so I just lost myself in that supreme happiness whenever Seth was with me or even the thought of Seth all time..(hides her face in Seth’s chest smiling,Seth smiles and both keep ach other very firmly)..I am full only with Seth noting else..yes dear,soully in luncay with you,with me..ever(both keep ach other for a few moments)..” Seth(smile,same pose) : “same for me Mehu,I ever lost myself in your presence and that made me forget all the body and else you ever came too close to me all time(laugh,Mehadi smiles) but not once did it feel awkward or not once any body and all popped up never the feeling of physicality just wanted to be beside you all time and if you weren’t physically present just your very thought without memory or anything just Mehu this thought was enough for me to hold onto all time and I was so happy personally cause I virtually saw you all time and thus never felt being away from you hence you and my professional life never collided and same for you and dealing with pokemons and not inanimate objects or ideas or living but unintelligent beings helped us in that sense immensely..we ever were at each other’s presence dear and hence I ever wanted just that as well never any physicality and hence even that obligation at present and I know with my state will for a long time feel excruiciatingly difficult cause Mehu is something else to me and her current form is included there..just my sweet Mehu(both smiles ach other very firmly for a few minutes)...(showing the ring again to Mehadi,Mehadi beams looking at it then at Seth,Seth also broadly smiles at Mehadi)..waiting for my flower to fit it in my finger..” Mehadi(looking at the ring,then looking at Seth) : “Seth..this is..yeah(laugh),suddenly for me too(both laugh)..” Seth(Mehadi is fitting Seth’s ring) : “yeah(laugh)..the Cerulean brats thought it’s a mandate according to public gospel that it’s only one way traffic(both laugh)..infact men need it more than women during the time of proposal for obvious reasons of responsibility(both laugh)” Mehadi(fitting the ring in and looking both looking the mirror,smile) :”Perfect,but Seth,the size is..” Seth(laugh and hug Mehadi) : “I’m cunning enough Mehu atleast inside my room(both laugh) you were sleeping in my arms only each and every time(both laugh)” Mehadi(smile) : “Seth..this is..my dream come true..” Seth(smile and  ehadi) : “still the first part of the two” Mehadi(broad smile and   looking at Seth) : “Seth..” Seth(smile) : “no rush though,we’ve got ages to fix the timeline” Mehadi(smile,shivering voice full of joy) : “you want everything then?” Seth(smile) : “sweetness turns bitter if it’s tasted again and again..hum,same as after Sinnoh Mehu flower..(smiles at Mehadi and Mehadi beams at Seth then hugs him very fimrly smiling Seth also hugs Mehadi very firmly smiling)..all in good times Mehu,future and else,all in good times...” (both keep ach other very firmly for a few moments)Seth(laughing) : “besides Mehu,we were 22 by the time Johto finished,now 38 already so many births and deaths in battle and gym..(both laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “then you also were undercover(both bursts into laughter)..” Seth(smile) : “just a thing sweetie you sure know the bro vs beau differentiation(both laugh) did it somehow worsen those stuffs for you..” Mehadi(smile) : “no that actually made me stronger in thinking that if you can so can I but I couldn’t and then after a month or two the others started you were travelling around and undercover you were in so much variety and me being there at gym and show and all that same old stuff so the ideas of something else came to me all for Seth nothing else(both broadly smiles ach other,few moments later) but(laugh) what a protection against Kalos(both laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “and I had Quizzy Rayquaza make a dragon so(both laugh),Giti the obvious(both laugh),Cozy is Ultracozy(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter) so these brats all time with Beehie,Hoopa,Banette and (laugh) Yveltal at pressroom on that occasion(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter) no Yvelie was outside others were in along with just my Metagrossy(laugh,Mehadi brusts into laughter) this world and my hallucinations which is real cause both change(both burst into laughter) and still UltraCozy(both laugh) so many types why no more cause without any or all or a few this idea of pocession forces you to separate yourself from them once you know they are cause you are thus being you doesn’t it always bore(both burst into laughter) that brat is something you know(both laugh) was at team rocket abjectly abused for 2 years only an Ultranercozma or a Giratina or a Latios could take that you know,Goodra and Zygarde are of a bit different type being ground only I ever consider them so cause their bodies are huge and hard they can bodyslam as good as Snorlax can but can’t surely(both laugh) anyway,Cozy faced me twice before the third when she switcheed over after very first month and may be a few weeks and since then was with me few others were there too like another Jirachi was but went off later with others EXCEPT of all Darmantian and Alomomola(both laugh) and all of them them were extremely intelligent but Cozy was most extremely intelligent even then(both laugh) the other two took a little more time just now absolute same just different ways to tickle(both laugh a lot) and you know with me and my approach to them ever only my soulmates stay and come to me others just not this life(smiles,Mehadi tenders Seth’s hairs smiling broadly at him) so she with Simi and Turto stayed then after that went to lab one month totally spoiled alongside obviously the obvious Gengy(both burst into laughter) who told everyone hearing my countering methods during the Crawdauntogator final planning before the team rocket final to end our plan as,so lets TICKLE to be COUNTERING(both burst into laughter) I knew the brat is totally mad anyway(both laugh) and Cozy said so many types these HUMANS(both laugh) some ever happy some ever sad master brat if happiness and sadness and all different types are only of me why am I of only 5 and not only me(both laugh) some brat that is and actually my bunch got even more extremely intilligent after she joined cause being at team rocket for 2 then 6/7 may be 3 years she knew so many things that otherwise we would’ve had to really take 18 more months at Kalos and then would’t have done Elite4 would’ve stayed at Kukui lab and only then do it cause we had to understand both me and my bunch those things so Cozy,Turto and Simi(both laugh) fastracked our system really by 1.5 years and thanks to team rocket for that I ever say(both laugh) Turto and Simi were abused to maxima as well and was there for a long time but was with a person an utmost lunatic brat hopefully now preparing for next term and she and me fought one match then psychic blast stuff happen I was safe she couldn’t take it her own bunch turned on her including Turto and Simi but none survived it was sucidal and after this one only did the boss agree for the mind games that were played upon me which still went well cause my bunch then with this incident realized they have to go more levels up cause the challengers didn’t stay alive and there were 12 of them only Turto and Simi survived was a volcano island and came on actually they just jumped us so weren’t that severe on their master others were and she was prepared for that so the calamity anyway,Turto and Simi did help us a lot a bit later actually their experiences were a bit different to Cozy they were normal bunch Cozy was barely tamed ever these two were caught and all normal then like Charizard came over and all my bunch is taught via travel companions and else to know when I’m talking and all if that is a not male(both laugh) then Chu can get my different feelings towards not males and now if there’s inconvenince in me around them or anyone(both laugh) well now all can thir intelligence is at the same level no difference even Mime same you know soulmates to each other by all means as well(laugh,Mehadi smiles tendering Seth’s hairs) so these circles 1,2,6 ft are set they know me and what I expect(both laugh) you were never told as not male thus you’re not not male(both laugh)..but they will call you SOMBRE STAT that’s infact second brat(both laugh) and especially Chu will say along with Crawdauntogator that SOMBRE STAT waiting at gym to bodyslam look-only-at the wait is to intensify that MOMENT,prolonging the wait to increase the joy,cunning(bursts into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs)..with their carefree nature they have to cogitate on something to be alive and sane and happy human beings would take up philosophy etc they can’t and knows only that so vulgarity is the thing for them and all these are in mental battle days were used to rile up opponents which are only they themselves(both laugh) and to us it serves the purpose of forgetting the body and the mind then(both laugh)..wicked(both burst into laughter)..anyway,so back to Lance, then I kept looking at your sweetly Mehadivious picture(both giggle at each other) and so Pikachu too just kept staring at you and looking at me and was very excited and was saying a single thing consistently,he you know understands me as well as anybody and he himself was happy to see you again after a very long time and he was always on my shoulder except the moment during breakup,you know he doesn’t understand break-ups and all cause his worldview is totally different,but probably he must’ve felt something as he used to see you all the time or hear you during our phonecalls and all and then we didn’t call and all that for a very long time,so he was happy and pointing to yourpicture in a low voice started constantly saying one word “Pikachupi!Pikachupi!Pikachupi” his word for “Mehadi”..and I just felt like I was looking at something so familiar yet so far as if I was touching something kept in front of me yet the touch felt like as if it’s lives million lives apart..as if I knew somehow a million years ago in a life many many lives ago and shared infinitely many memories that were so precious that I just couldn’t move after all these many years later and despite my internal bliss of the joyous memories that I might’ve shared,it was only covering an unfathomable darkness that I’m touching something long gone no matter how joyous it’s just memories it can’t be revived anymore it’s DEAD..this death was unbearable to me as I just realized that it can’t be dead somehow but no matter what it just can;t be death and death made no sense yet this idea of death as if was cruelly grinning at me and devouring my being completely..and Pikachupi flet like a warm breeze hitting my face constantly,without ceasing but it was sweet yet that darkness as if was only cruelly veiling it’s lurking teeths that were about to tears me apart and was licking it’s lips in the impending and inevitable joy as soon as I fall...and tears automatically rolled down my cheeks profusely I later found out..and(bit choked)..it was then I first had a glimpse of what you really are to me and what I’m myself..there it actually felt like it’s only me million lifes ago yet so far away and it’s as if just another type of body that I had and I’ve ever so longed for a grand union again just to get rid of all bodies and differences thatt is imaginable to the one permanent existence consciousness that I truly am..and it wasn’t like looking at your own 5 year old picture,it was something way way stronger than anything I ever have heard,read,seen or experienced that I can relate to..and yet it was so natural..I forgot actually I can’t really describe what I did see but I didn’t see flesh and blood at all there or anything related to you,I didn’t know if you were Mehadi or whatever I just knew that it was me only me but this idea of death cruelly was hindering my realization and as by then I had become habituated to by analysis to separate out flesh and blood and ideas and all and no I didn’t even remember any good things that you may’ve ever done to me or who you were etc,Pikachu’s words and this picture had given me the realization that I never imagined,I just realized as if someone firmly but gently speaking in my head in my own voice and exactly the first moment I herd this voice I conquered that idea of death,the voice said- “Mehadi-that’s your soul,you are that as well and the difference you’re making is only your own illusion,you are Mehadi and Mehadi is you,no difference is there,see it for yourself”..and I don’t know how long I stood there or I just didn’t want to part,I just got overjoyed and the tears just became of joy unlike a few moments ago...I had an intuition of soul as being indescribable but I felt it then and there it self...I on one hand realized I’m truly the soul and all else word and things are nothing and simultaneously you are also part of me or you’re only me myself..I was my Mehadi indeed and this intuition that Mehadi is inside me not out here finally got tangibly vivid beyond doubt for me but..(laugh)..here here here..”
Mehadi(deep sigh) : “Seth, you’re also a Disaster Master!why break this moment up?I was seeing that as well..”
Seth(bit puzzled) : “um..sorry..but(laugh)..I just realized now that if then,exactly then some vulture dared to be around and this is another God’s Grace that they didn’t,but if they did and disturbed me or gave the scene to the press,I would’ve been very happy to set at that very moment all of my pokemons on the vulture if I was even remotely disturbed then or my moment went public,but God didn’t let that happen out of the infinite compassion,so all vultures were saved and No,Mehu really,if I didn’t get you due to some vultures roaming around then disturbing me,my name would’ve been written with blood then and there and I knew nobody present in that building could do anything about me or my pokemons actions and it wouldn’t have been nice and I would’ve become a real nerve wreck then as I would’ve tried to push my pokemons to absolute ultimate,killing them and myself in the process..now so hopefully vultures showed some intelligence there and saved their godforsaken lives and MINE as well..anyhow..vulture is a good name I..”
Mehadi(frown) : “Seth,I would like that the infinite compassion be helpful to you in restraining me from smacking you the next time you suddenly drag vultures in a most beautiful scene,continue now” Seth(laugh) : “alright,alright,so the vultur..um,no don’t do that(Mehadi lightly smacks Seth’s head),its ok(laugh)..so sweet is my flower’s sweet sweet touch(Mehadi frowns and mocks smacking then laughs,Seth smiles)..ok do that always but gently..” Mehadi(sigh) : “Seth,please you..” Seth(smile) : “ok,ok,bear with me,I’m just back,so I was in this trance like state and then I was brought back to my senses by a Gentle hand on my shoulders..it was Lance,and I also recognised that Pikachu had long stopped uttering your name and was constantly looking at me,so I just
suddenly was brought back to my senses and looking at Lance was just startled and didn’t know what to say,in the mean time Noivern put the picture back and came beside me,I called him back but I had no words at all in my head,then Lance very gently broke the silence saying,in his words-
>
Lance(kind face) : “Seth! You alright?”
Seth(stuttering) : “um..it’s all right..I just..um..”
Lance(kind face) : “Lost in thoughts?”
Seth(thoughtfull) : “yeah I guess..(laughing)..age related tough(both burst into laughter)"..no really Mehu this really did come out of my mind just after instantly hence could get a grip over myself really countering dually(both laugh a lot)..this is so funny cause each step of thought these brats will pop up sadly(both laught)..Pasio JUST THAT blooming youth(both un.. cheering for DR JACKAL)..standing in the lushes of green without even that shoe used while BUSHING(both un..)..what brats we have plane agnostic DASHING DASHING ROCK(both laugh..lot)..man afterall i told Lance before that certificate is the only thing that holds value rest is totally useless from our part(both laugh..lot)..anyway,
Lance(kind face) : “Seth that's not really in question now you’ve been standing like this for 10 minutes at least as I’ve entered here and was just observing you and I left you here 10 minutes before that,so it must be 20 minutes there or there about.Seth,the tears”...and then I suddenly realized I cried a lot first time in my life consciously in EDUCATION(both burst..)..you namecall what have you done to my sweet May,the sentence and action makes no sense Mr Blackmore unless you were EDUCATED on how to nay,mentally that is(both burst..)..man God bless my sweetest little bro from that little Torchic(both laugh.lot)..anyway so i quickly wiped off the tears saying indeed salty why not healthy,countering(both burst..)..
Lance(smile) : "you will know that best Seth..(both laugh..lot).."
Seth(laughing) : “um..no it’s alright Lance..I just was going through the motions i made a mistake indeed that's all”
Lance(kind face) : “Seth,it’s alright,I know her well she never did anything except the tears itself..”..I don’t know Mehu,but suddenly this past tense word - “did”..became too unbearable to me and I burst out in a bit high pitched voice-
Seth(frown) : “Please,enough i don't require her existence!” Lance(kind face) : “Seth..”
Seth(thoughtful) : “um..sorry Lance..but she’s still alive atleast this I know you said did and it just felt a bit awkward to me if she was dead it wouldn't have she has been dead existentially to me since my breakup exactly my mistake that's why..i didn't do justice to my girlfriend of 19 years when she still was officially just that,anyhow um..sorry for shouting at you Lance..”
Lance(kind face) : “Seth,it’s all right,you were wanting to know more about her right?”
Seth(a bit angry) : “Lance it’s ok..it’s alright it’s been 5 years just her thoughts suddenly came up just as you said she isn't married..it was awkward cause i heard she was she herself told me yesterday..”
Lance(kind) : “Seth..it’s ok i know that saga you've never been able to hide yourself in reflections atleast..”
Seth(laugh) : “well that's the counter to Phantom in myths anyway(both burst..)”
Lance(a bit firmly) : “no Seth wait,I know you for 38 years personally too unlike a lot of the rest given my association and position in career in this profession experiences and so on existentially I have an idea that it’s only her memories what is bugging you for couple of years now atleast given your press activities and especially given just after that difficult moment of your life may be you were undercover and hence your public behaviours later and I realize your position and 19 years too and what your bunch did during Unova so I can understand what you were going through right after the legendary final against Chongark it was the best league match ever if made on per with the final next day and no she isn’t at all alright or in a happy state as you may not know from yesterday certainly and this is for atleast since the Frucifern fiasco and that’s a year already but there’s much more to that,I will tell you about Mehadi all that I reliably and personally know cause she hasn't been much forward for a long time now..and about yesterday certainly she didn't tell you the truth infact she used you to shield herself i'll assume no matter her intention cause the usage may be just to divert her attention from the present that's all..but you must stay here tonight as we have to finish with this,you’ve been absent from the dinner for too long,you must comply with me”..by then I had returned to my senses cause those brats Chu and Nivy first didn’t get my signals thus second were flustered as to what had suddenly happened cause it was you understand deep human nature even beyond emotions normal people won’t get they won’t either so this made them a bit agitated cause it was for long then Nivy tried to brutally slaughter my realization by foisting his age related thoughts on me in second person(both laugh) yeah the luck of having soulmates at different planes(both laugh) then Chu did save me there being the third(both un..) saying it’s ok cause he knew with his Pikachupi look-only-at is a bit too serious always(both laugh)..infact(laughing) as i said he repeated those words in a bit agitated voice as to i never looked at your picture or anything before for long in the illusive years so now why go back to dinner THIS IS SO ENSUING(both un..)..yeah not for nothing Stashey has been trapped here none could manage the depravity of this brat(both laugh..lot) so the brat told Nivy observe the brat closely till some other human brats enter then we will use that brat to poke this brat to get the break-up moment to be the most ENTHRALLING(both burst into laughter,Mehadi in tears and fits of laughter)..thank God Lance is an once only hall of famer and still later said didn't have translators else would've certainly disturbed you(both burst..)..yeah that’s an extremely nasty pest competing with Daunty now always you saw yourself(both laugh)..” Mehadi(laugh) : “man this brat has become something indeed(both laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “to get the moment to be the most ENDEARING(both burst into laughter)..well that's his master brat absolutely(both laugh..lot)..today saw a different side of him that we the compeers,Blithie and May only knew except mom and Zed he had never showed to anyone barring mom and May ofcourse else she would've been long dead(both laugh..lot)..hugged me and Kuzu first time never saw his hand going below the back of head which included mom always too(both laugh..lot) so we hugged him always rather and ofcourse couldn't reach his head just the tip(both laugh..) but today said you two refused to look after your siblings starting from Hertie and Daxtie else i would've been long off man but now you're not leaving these menaces to emotions upon me they're not even human(both laugh..lot) then itself put the hand on the back of our heads and said countering existence an excuse isn't it(both laugh a lot)..man what brats these are plane agnostic(both laugh)..May had a similar experience as you know like saw his much softer side when she was about to lose it brought Shrew in and told them they are useless m.. except for reductionist faculties of phenomena said thanks and went off(both laugh..lot)..on Doolie(both burst)..both understood what sort of a brat that is countering everywhere even the choice of brat(both laugh..lot)..May later caught him then said tendered me like a newborn and said till there's duality nothing's stable(both laugh..lot) then anyway she still says none could surprise me on and after Ransei no matter how i react to it it was my fault not their ingenuity(both laugh..lot)..anyway,then Lance entered and they already had lost their patience thus each brat I had then came out(both laugh) I didn’t have many just Dupul and Dragu as usual(both laugh) so they were doing what they do and actually Dupul saved me with his review the view theory as he's doing a thesis on it with Confra(both laugh..lot) then anyway Lance came and Chu and Nivy were about to jump him with Dragu telling them telling them from invisibility how to interact with him when Dupul said wait Nivy if you drop that object look-only-at may force you to hold it again logically shouldn’t he(both burst into laughter) so the brats desisted(both laugh)..man later they told me these I thought thank God they are not HUMAN(both laugh) but you see I took the chance because..please this is just jokingly..I politely asked Lance if I could mouth the press off and if I sweared may he spare me,Lance smiled and said that he himself will get rid of the press and will finish the night as quickly as possible and besides not much was left of it..so,anyhow I couldn’t thrash the vultures then and there for their campaign to ruin my personal life and helping my self illusion over my soulmate my sweet Mehu flower(tendering Mehadi,Mehadi smiles and hugs Seth firmly)..and so again Lance saved himself and vultures..thus it happened..then I just returned to your picture and Noivern kept holding it and I kept gazing at you,I did it just to recreate the moment and Lance happily obliged as i asked him of the possibilities of personifications(laughs..lot)” Mehadi(blush a bit) : “um..Seth..” Seth(smile) : “na,it’s alright with him,your’re like his second daughter given Ruth is 5 years older to you like Lillie flower if she knows what age is like Lillie flower(both laugh..lot) and he did treat me as his own son all time just as Ruth ever treats me as you know which was there as usual no matter what Viol flower expresses(both laugh) or her own sweet cute beau(both laugh) man Wayne was my staunch opponent since day one and Ruth supporter just like Drew and May so yeah I’ve divided up many families so definitely it’s alright(both laugh),but here you must bear with me again as I want to contrast the reasons why other people thought we’re made for each other” Mehadi(laugh) : “ya,I would.(both laugh)” Seth(smile) : “alright,Lance told me as I was again tendering the picture,that what you were upto with your activities and overwork,suddenly turning on the Frucifern gym for pestering you and then creating legal skirmish,besides that brat himself told me his whole life history from previous few lives as well in future(both laugh) bit by bit like other few brats did whom I spoke of and those 4 brats right at the beginning each brat came to know what happens if you pester someone’s wife only cause she is so sweet inherently that can’t show you your anatomy in Choiced language and this brat most cause he was at Karapaskar for an hour with Giratina and Ultranercozma(both laugh) and before or after I can’t recall cause the hallucinations were complementary not entailing(both laugh) but was with Gengleye this I do recall(both laugh) for one more(both laugh) well I did tell you and you saw what they do but now just see why the brat is so relieved now(both laugh),it is all cause GitiRosey showed a day in the life of a marked out college suspended Giratina(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter) and Ultranercozma went there inspecting colleges and logically showing them how the courseworks needed to be totally revised as it currently does rather a disservice to a bigger talent pool forcing certain type of courses only like responsibility of being a Giratina but not how to object against it(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter) or doing so against being a Giratina to being with if a dragon why not also the type of a Flygon why the universities don’t exchange rather shy students(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter) and Gengar tickles and Sableye compels others to act like him and Gengar the Frucifern version was Dark Night : a lesson on the twists of life in tickling turns(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter)” Mehadi(laugh) : “thank God I didn’t get GitiRosey too(both laugh) but I got the full wrath of those two tickling pests for keeping them serious for 7 hours(both laugh)..and no they moderated the charges by then but those two brats Quizzy and Dillie man they are ruthless by all means(both laugh)” Seth(lauugh) : “Dialga don’t be a gambler just spin the WHEEL/when a brat enters the gym,just put up the look of that Boulder STEEL(both laugh)/in you life what is happening always are translated only of yourself what you FEEL(both laugh)/thus if these feelings are upended doesn’t it mean all along you’re only cooking your very own MEAL(both burst into laughter) ..man no wonder those songs poured out of our Viol flower(both laugh) and no wonder no other brat would’ve managed it 13 years with our brats in and still finding enough time to babysit Shrew the Drew,May the sister-pester,lady Dawn,Pulu and Finnie(both laugh) but ultimately 'he..he listens to me to know me'(both un..) man that brat is impossible to manage(both laugh..lot) if Mehu Gyarados was at Kanto as well(laughs,Mehadi smirks at Seth tending  im and laughs) no Mehu except Trace none of us if were travel companions would’ve returned from Unova you know that is you,Brock,Ciddy,Poppy or Gary hence only these and thus only Poppy went through all that(smiles,Mehadi smiles  oy very firmly,tendering Mehadi,smile)..no Poppy is ok now won't be returning here unless Daisy and Violet calms down a bit and she needs to be at Bosangria


No dear,I shouldn’t have left you just like that to those vultures,not as a boyfriend atleast what to speak of as a husband..I told you you didn’t seem to be my wife then neither was I your husband then dear I realized it later after the journey itself well infact not after the finals but after returning from Huntelion empty handed all of us..us man us(laughs a lot,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..so when Kommo-O said nothing to add to us or you(both laugh a lot)..then said(laughing..lot)..your intentions to be ontological doesn't at all seem noble only novel to epistemology(both un..)..anyway(both laugh..lot) so I thought man even that devilish little Torchic has one from third damn journey that too with a Shrew IT’S INHUMAN!(both laugh)..so thought well then this is our 3rd failure to get a Kommo-O whole world even this namecall Iris has one(both laugh) and that brat sitting on my head due to temporal scales and smugs all time I’m in a trouble has one too(both laugh) that too as a Goddamn starting beau(both laugh) so then I thought just beat it I’m setting my whole on hand bunch upon this whole damn gang right now(both laugh) and I had none(laughs a lot,Mehadi frowns,Seth laughs even more)..(squeezing Mehadi’s cheeks,laughs,Mehadi frowns)..hum,sweetie I so much like this pose you look so sweetie(laughs,Mehadi is a bit concerned and hugs him)..no dear,it’s a long story I can’t take anyone infact now except for the facilitator that I don’t know if you heard or not went to Heatran den with my Heatrie who was 2 days old to felicitate amd Mushy to review then Incie was like few hours just with Lycie my Lycanroc taking place of Mushy now that post is too redundant..(laughs,Mehadi still a bit concerned but smiles)..no,it’s ok you know you’ll get accustomed to it and no at present I don’t need to go anywhere in the next month atleast you know that..(Mehadi smiles)..right,anyhow Kuzu went after Moltres that too abused(laughs,Mehadi frowns)..well his flower even there i heard said did he talk with them emotionally(both burst..),no Mehu i saw my sweet little Poppy doll too that day Kuzu took her out didn't look at all normal anyway is ok now thankfully..anyway,so as I was saying I thought I should be stern with them and drag a brat with me for Mr Oak or atleast its tail(both laugh)..then understood if I’m stern with them my own bunch will instantly kill me(laughs,Mehadi bit concerned smiles)..no(laugh),just beat it Mehu it’s ok JUST A LOGICAL GAME(laughs,Mehadi smiles)..just see what curse befalls the dashing crook mentally that is(both laugh a lot)..get ready your first final man what is it with you,the last one Seth,DIALGA DON’T BE A GAMBLER JUST SPIN THE WHEEL/WHEN YOU SEE,HEAR OR FEEL ANYTHING JUST LET IT LIVE ONLY IN THAT FEEL(both uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..man Pewter Rock is only what is once in 3 millenias Mehu no matter absolute just think of the associate setup itself and the name AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(both laugh a lot)..man that day of very first ordination Mehu we all were so serious next day went into laughing the whole(both laugh a lot)..anyway,so I understood my own illusion as well but then you called and said something and I was
still in process so went after the skin(both laugh)..no sweetie,I never realized how much monkey business went around my sweet Mehu flower since the day she returned and those m.. were sentimental fools that b.. Trace(Mehadi frowns)..just wait till I step foot in that place,they’ll not be able to sleep for a week with what I’m just going to tell them first day itself(Mehadi laughs)..I’m only getting started and now I’m soully Mehadivious(giggles,Mehadi smiles)..” Mehadi( oy,smile) : “Seth,it’s all right you know,don’t strain yourself,I’ve forgotten all those now that I’ve my sweet soulmate..nothing matters now no matter what they do...just don’t get so anxious..Trace did what he could you know that too..but(laugh)..I know you’re not going to stop atleast on the first day no matter what,what are you gonna say..?” Seth(laugh) : “the first thing after formal announcement where I’ll show my power and give all that to you showing what you are to me grossly so that the buffoons may know it’ll be dangerous to mingle with this Gym given your power now and more importantly my public image and antics,then I’ll just threaten them that if they still pester too much,I’ll take up all that power by virtue of my marriage and make Cerulean Badge a must win with 2 at a time for 3 FULL ROUNDS (Mehadi laughs),which means death to any number of legends as you know who’ll start for me(Mehadi laughs) and the next rounds are Seismitoad who says water and ground is turning into each other each moment don’t you feel so(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter) and Samurott who says land is to be swam and water to be walked cause what’s left to me isn’t that at your right(laughs a lot,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs and fits of laughter and in tears laughing and claps) then will come the dragons Palkia and Kyurem to tell you that circularly you don’t know yourself cause you weren’t born before knowing yourself thus no point being born(laugh,Mehadi burst into laughter) if this wasn’t enough I’ll change the gym into a fire gym with ReshiNator(Mehadi laughs) or one on one with Volcanion(both laugh) who doesn’t understand the difference(both laugh) and all the while keeping all water pokemons exactly beside the fire types that is Typhlosion who says won’t running after things never stop in retardating life like Buzzwole says eat can’t breed so only-sleep wake-up repeat(both burst into laughter) that pest was an absolute menace in Kalos presses(both laugh a lot) and insinuate that my flying fire types are irritated by my dragons too much and all will be so(Mehadi laughs) are not getting free roaming,unleashing them on the damn city whose flying department is controlled by Jaheem!Juheem!Jiheem!(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter)..yeah YOUR METHOD OF DISCERNING YOUR SOULMATE

Mehadi(laugh) : “well neither he has professionally thus with her personally(both laugh)..no since the very start Lil thought you were indeed my soulmate as much as she yearned for Gary only was shattered after i started those substances but anyway I’ve never seen Gary emotional even with Lil never(both laugh) except he spoke a bit softly with her unlike anyone else(both laugh),she said only on the judgment day did directly cry exactly one drop from both eye which professionally didn’t go out of his personal eyelids when closed specifically(both burst into laughter)..just told Lil i'm not losing you too like them those two namecalls never mature when it comes to MY personal life(both laugh..lot) before that to her and to her direct relatives just like all your bros except Brock but including you hallow never hi(both laugh)..I only found that his voice was a tinge softer in professional scales to me that’s all(both laugh) which was similar to how he personally spoke with Lil may be which Lil said is his normal behaviour now after marriage I’ve exchanged places with the rest of the world(both laugh) and you know him not of that type(both laugh)..only Dase never thought that we two were soulmates always telling me to learn from Kuzu never Poppy(both laugh..lot) but she had a point in neutral bushes ofcourses(both laugh) and then Viol you know(both laugh) ever said it’s all about your infatuation not their positions(both laugh) GIVE UP THIS SANITY TO BE FREE(both laugh)..thank God I’ve not met that brat personally yet else would’ve had to rethink on returning to my profession(both laugh)..”
Seth(laugh) : “by every means(both laugh),anyway back to Lance cause I don’t want to start on Infie cause it is infinite by all means especially 235 intricately linked which bit atleast Mr Oak knows too by now(both laugh)..no Mehu I just couldn’t be happier ever this term now that I see that my nephews are arriving and nieces are already here for a year now you know human existence is about illusion you never know what’s going to happen hence I really was happy inside as soon as Professor said no the other halves are indeed the ones that were DESTINED to be so(both laugh a lot),anyway Lance told the stories and all about you and your recent problems,I almost instantly knew that all you were doing was only longing to see me and was entrapped in a golden cage with the huge responsibility of polishing it everyday,so you finally resorted to your pokemons and gym and then the gym become a nerve wrecking work but was rather your only resort to be distracted off from your personal troubles hence the Frucifern one was added and all else and it did get you in Hall of Fame but you weren’t all right and then those stuffs which Daisy complained against you and then he said they were thinking of red flagging you the next challenger said your bunch isn’t behaving properly nor you and you weren’t in very last days there were slips here and there Sarah told me but this was just before I first called you out via press and she knew why I was there and also why you were in such plight hence didn’t do anything and also then Lance went on and told me about your present state a bit just that you’re playing hide and seek thinking of Seth only(both smile at each other) and then I said look I just want my girlfriend back plain and simple whole world knows my contributions despite my name the questions and all(both laugh) I only ever wanted Mehadi Waterflower current Cerulean Gym leader in my life to be my wife and that’s all for me this term atleast along with my bunch and the word pokemon in general and had I have had my bunch and pokemons but my only human wish to have my Mehadi as my wife was fulfilled in a way that I had her for 19 long years and then for atleast 16 of it her feelings exactly matched mine and thus I will get her back by any means cause my premonition is that she is only thinking about me too hence may be other relationships aren’t suiting her either but would you help the behind the back stuffs cause she won’t date me atleast if already with someone else no matter what her state is if that’s the case and won’t have an appointment either else would’ve agreed to let me in the gym when we first contacted so would you help,and from that itself I know she isn’t in a happy relation even from the other side cause even if the infatuation was true I would’ve been allowed first up there and spoken to too which Lance agreed to but then despite knowing my abilities and Team Rocket history tried to advise me which I’m always blessed to be bestowed upon EXCEPT when it comes to my sweet Mehu flower cause she's me hence it's like saying why aren't you just me(both laugh..lot) cause he said that you have picked up a bit of a bad name recently cause a few recent challengers 4+ or 5+ have already complained about your bunch not being in a good state and they suspect you have made your hands dirty especially just after getting the Hall of Fame entry with illegal business and that itself was the way how you got into hall of fame they suspect and also this same tag will thus now protect you even more,as soon as he said illegal and then cheat,I politely said that I helped busting team rocket and I’ve had enough experience with illegal things given what my bunch forced me to use to keep my nerves sane(both laugh) which he said he just cautioned me because he thought I liked that picture cause it brought back my great memories with my very long time girlfriend but I might get a rude awakening,I politely said if he gives me other protections that just lets me to mingle with the press there and do my things and fool around without those brats from police,I’ll do my maximum but I said please I don’t want to hear a word more on the past,present or future(showing the
ring,Mehadi laughs) Mehadi Waterflower cause I’ve had nothing but only just her as my full personal life for 19 years atleast my part has been always same and hence I know her which I belive and only she again can break it so please then Lance realized it and just patted me saying just was seeing if Rue was right about his bro after all too no matter her hubby,i said that's what obdurate infatuation of a quarter of century does to one(both laugh..lot)..so then I set things up with Lance,came out for the first week gauged the whole situation around you..then planned went to Venturiastrog which university lecture I attended twice to confirm my realization after my sweetie’s picture came to me yeah at lecture halls 3 in total I attended which had in teams of 2- MetaLatiDollQuazaHydreiTal(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter) anyway(both laugh),then at Kalos there a brat challenged me with a Riumina as I said this match was fixed by Percy for me to keep his home peaceful(both laugh..lot) he was requested by that lunatic and he I guess is a runaway from Unovan legends gorup I used Muk who said like,if you hug your beau despite they not liking your to much advances I’m myself inviting you to hug without any evil intentions don’t be so infatuated with beaus(both burst into laughter)..that was it of course(both laugh)..Manthie said this and this plane this and that strategy i said you're in hall of fame do you understand it even,it's not an emotion only mind isn't it Seth hum(both burst..)..man that brat is something if not her little brat himself(both laugh..lot) anyway then returned and got you back that’s all(both smiles at each other ach other very firmly)..”

(Cilan Calls,both laugh)
Seth(laughing) : “I got it dear,just watch the ardent fun..(both laugh)..” Cilan(bit concerned) : “um..hallow Seth,sorry to disturb you but..” Seth(frown) : “is it a personally professional sweet talk time sweetie at EXACT MIDDAY THERE from HERE(both laugh silently) as if I’m in the mood or is it not profesionally in personal interests?(both burst into laughter silently)” Cilan(angry) : “so,already on the spot then hey(Seth and Mehadi burst into laughter silently),fine I just..” Seth(laugh) : “Brock told you a few minutes ago and you got so overjoyed that forgot to watch your watch and came to check my room whether I was dying from loneliness of sanity(both burst into laughter silently)?” Cilan(sigh) : “Seth please,you know me..” Seth(frown) : “impossible if you’re not me as says my Butterfree(both laugh silently)” Cilan(sigh) : “which isn’t agreed to by your very own sweet sweet Palki(all laugh) as he says how can you know me after you’ve become me as me only that first moment of becoming according to your starting brat thus is the most ENCOMPASSING(both burst into laughter in silence)..(sigh)..man just get rid of these pests for ONCE(both laugh in silence)..I just couldn’t be happier if..” Seth(frown) : “what is it that exactly bugs you Cili,my happiness or the restarting date ideally an ideology that my Emboar seeks in his life thoroughly(both burst into laughter,silence)..” Cilan(sigh) : “Seth,please you have all except your personal happiness and this foolish self created misfortune of yours wouldn’t have lasted even for a week if you weren’t idiotically stubborn enough to never call ‘mam back even after your antics during undercover with those utmost brats who told you to tickle to win matches that to not the challenger but yourself(both burst into laughter silently) and YOU DID EXACTLY THAT(both laugh in silence) and hearing the danger that you were in,a random anyone would get a shock for life what to speak of someone like ‘mam who is so gentle hearted even in genral UNLIKE HER GYARADOS THAT SYMBOLIZES HER GYM(both laugh uncontrollably in silence) and you know exactly well why it was solely your own responsibility to contact ‘mam just after the day you were so nonchallanty rude enough to talk extremely harshly to such a kind hearted person and do all your drama of break-ups THAT WAS DIRECTED BY YOUR GLALIE WHO PREPARED THE LINE NOTHING TO BEAUTY CAUSE ONLY THAT WILL SHOW HOW BEAUTIFUL THE BEAUTY IS ONLY(both uncontrollably laugh in silence) these pests are definitely all due to your faults with them in psychological nonsense(both laugh in silence) and it always will be your fault only to refuse to contact ‘mam again and again simply given who ‘mam is and her responsibilities outside of her personal life BEING A BEACON UNTO THE MASS AT 11 city ESPECIALLY HER HOMETOWN THE GREAT Cerulean(both uncontrollbaly laugh silently)..you just took everything for granted cause your hometown was close to the great Cerulean City and YOUR LAB COLLEAGUES WERE THERE like Dr Skechit(both uncontrollably laugh in silence with Seth audibly doing so and telling Cilan,Dr jackal said look I’ve SketchedIT down by days alright?,both laugh even more in silence)..(sigh)..yeah no wonder Daisy had to quit the gym was becoming the most enthralling(both uncontrollblay laugh in silence,Mehadi in tears laughing) and you had your brothers and other friends there who were your bros too and yet you just never bothered to even talk properly with them when such a person like ‘mam ever considered you so wholeheartedly and all ‘mam ever wanted was that you don’t continue your antics in public circuses called after battle parties where you were never invited BUT YOUR HOOPA MOST CERTAINLY WAS backside front in unbound form saying Mr Ketchum means Mehuer as Ketchum thus why specify only to generalize again or the viseversa like wasting your vitality by trying to define the same(both burst into laughter in silence with Seth audibly saying but Mr Cubin what would that moment mean to you mentally that is,both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence,Mehadi in tears laughing in silence,Cilan angry and sigh)..yeah I get it too much glee(all laugh) and that too in front of press(both laugh silently)..you..(sigh,both laugh in silence)..just tell me whether you’ve had the minimum intelligence to atleast properly beg pardon from ‘mam in a proper meeting(both laugh with Seth audibly saying,that brat was waiting in the gym whining her grievance to you only to implant her constant thoughts in you thus keeping you BOOKED all time to ask for this day a date,you see cunning,both laugh even more)..yeah if only that godforsaken brat knew what’s emotion THAT’S HUMAN(Seth audibly says,standing in the bushes metaphor independent without even a WINK,bursts into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter in silence,Cilan angry)..yeah only two such great persons like Dr Skechit and Mrs Waterflower Skechit could so far tolerat a brat of a bro like you(both laugh a lot in silence saying across the bushes) do tell me that you’ve apologized to ‘mam or whether you still are thinking that because in one call 5 years is brushed aside why should I care cause my Squirtle doesn’t(both burst into laughter silently)..only a person like ‘mam in this world full of what you know more than me cause you were obtruding them with your Yveltal and Reshiram(both laugh uncotrollably in silence),only a person having such generosity like ‘mam would ever remember someone like you who doesn’t understand anything except how to perfectly thunder chair all out of what they call the despondency of sanity(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence) ‘mam ever has remembered you for only the right reasons and infact even has given you a chance to say sorry properly not being rude(both laugh)..do you even understand clearly that no matter what you did in your travel days and how much you tormented ‘mam then(both burst into laughter in silence) for the last 13 years atleast if not more there’s no woman that’s more skillful in her profession and graceful and kind and generous and who has all the right qualities in infinite quantity in her(Seth audiably says just like her symbolic Gyarados who told me to ask her if she is appearing as a woman to herself how can she be assured that there’ll be none else like her cause to specify one among the general is the reason why we’re personally alone as professionally knows any vocational training entrance failed Blacephalon Cili whose that pokemon,both uncontrollblay laugh in silence,Cilan sigh)..yeah I understand what your damn Zeky Ketchum does(both laugh even more in silence) and you were lucky enough out of all to have a place in ‘mam’s heart cause you were travel companions and given ‘mam’s character only such a long and strong relation would make sure of that IF ONLY SHE WANTED(both laugh a lot in silence ach other) but it was there where inevitably ‘mam showed you how to battle and lead life both of which you rejected wholeheartedly cause your Haunter said all good but do they tickle enough(both uncontrollably laughs,Mehadi in tears and fits of laughter) and you taking that chance think you can do whatever you want and just go around at all gyms,trash talk make public scenes and I even heard you have recently created a fuss in Cerulean as well with your sweet sweet UltraCozy which asked me Mr Cubin this idea you have that you know yourself to be of a particular type compels you too search for other similar or dissimilar types to enstrength your conviction of your type but at the same time all you try to do is to define your type cause you want to be you that must be given a type thus actually this idea of type itself is only imputed upon your being which thus isn’t of any type hence Mr Cubin why this infatuation to be responsible defining yourself of being a type when you will still ask of your type from others to yourself Mr Cubin how can you ever be sane without knowing insanity mentally that is(both burst into laughter in silence) thus Mr Cubin this sanity isn’t it a curse unto responsible life as a professional in consultative personal tickling(both laugh uncontrollably,tears,in silence)..you..(sigh,both laugh even more in silence)..I’m just wasting my time again(both laugh in silence)..just tell me that you’ve not joked with Brock and also weren’t joking with ‘mam too increasing her pain even more(Seth again says just like her private attitude with gym leading cosmetics and both laugh uncontrollably in silence)..yeah,you’re the SOLE reason why ‘mam couldn’t continue the show(both laugh in silence) and infact you’re the centre of many people’s wrath for that only ESPECIALLY IN Cerulean(both laugh uncontrollably in silence) cause I heard the Cerulean Gym too isn’t in good condition despite hall of fame status recently cause ‘mam’s health hasn’t been alright for a long time and ‘mam rather in these days aren’t so happy despite getting into hall of fame which only ‘mam could do in such conditions if they’re true which I still am saying despite knowing everything in minute details cause me having seen Unova and currently having to bear the burns of the whole world clamouring for me cause you said Mr Cilan Cubin is best defined by my starter who as you know has been on my shoulders both our whole life during travels most times so he after meeting Mr Cubin told me electricity master brat is effective only if the regulation is proper to make it most suitable to the necessity according the pertaining FEELING(both laugh a lot I silence)/if compared to emotions master brat observing the chain of reasoning behind it’s existence and cessation master brat rather than either exclusive is what makes the shoreline neither it’s either constituent sides nor the objects it holds to feel the most THRILLING(Seth cheers for SAYS THE ART of STRAVATION IF YOU WANT TO DO JUSTICE TO YOUR FIRST RESTAURANT DATE BILLING,both uncontrollably laugh in tears and fits of laughter in silence,Seth
audibly further says just like I heard Cili at 17 in Pewter my first date with your Mehadifying ‘mam,Dialga don’t be a gambler just spin the wheel,both uncontrollably laugh in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter in silence,Cilan angry)..yeah I would’ve loved to see which so and so would’ve tolerated you then unless for Brock and ‘mam(both laugh a lot in silence Seth audibly saying Oh Now goes MR you who OAK!/hush professionals..seen who oh reference to Oak/thus hi oh My bye bye Oak,both uncontrollably laugh saying The Professional Personalities,both laugh a lot in silence,Cilan scowls)..yeah you wouldn’t have completed ONE DAMN MONTH SINCE YOUR INCEPTION IN THIS TERM WITH HIM(both laugh a lot in silence)


and that ‘mam has much mental pain now a days as it’s heard around and I of all surely know who the culprit is in your Zeky’s language just Seth(both laugh uncontrollably in silence)..that dreg of dragonic society(both uncontrollably laugh in silence,tears) told me when you thought of marrying another did you do so because of the other or was it only cause of yourself you were too bothered(both burst into laughter in silence)..just tell me that you’ve patched up with ‘mam and isn’t again fooling around with ‘mam in such condition(both laugh in silence)..”
Seth(solemn) : “hmm..I see Cili I’ve no place in the fans hearts ESPECIALLY AT THE GREAT CITY OF CeruleanS(laugh,Mehadi laughs in silence,Cilan sighs shaking his head)..but no what you heard is true with innumerable problems only starting with the weather of the date as Hydrie said would be busy yesterday not today but my schedule didn’t allow me to wait longer in certain weathers especially at Cerulean’s City(both burst into laughter in silence) with also one small problem that needs especial attention from especially you that’s what’s in a name Cili why Ms Mehadi Waterflower not Unovaflower Cili why not in those familial feelings(both burst into laughter in silence)...”
Cilan(sigh) : “that you’ve already created a fuss in Cerulean just after the patch up CAUSE THAT’S NOT THE FORMAL CULTURAL GIRATINA FAMILY AT KARAPASKAR WETLANDS,UNOVA(both laugh uncontrollably in silence)..”
Seth(laugh in silence,straight,Mehadi laughs in silence) : “sadly an ocean Cili yeah the water is rather deliriously flowered as deepeningly showered(both laugh in silence)”
Cilan(frown) : “yeah realized too much primary school classes bunked to go to riverside plants to see how couples fail after so many years of bonhomie so that next day teachers are alarmed hallucinations of Latios(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence)”
Seth(laugh,frown) : “exactly Cili(both laugh silently,Cilan angry and sigh) but who are childhood friends,who are travelling friends,who are school friends,who Cili are office friends who are the neighbourhood friends,who are the once friends who are the ever friends who are the twice only friends who after that became the reconciling friends who Cili who are the only for a timespan like a train journey friends who are the Cili long time no see friends who are Cili information sharing friends(Mehadi laughs in silence) but more importantly oh my dear Cili who are who are the distant friends and most importantly Cili whom can you tell that you’re my BEST friend..(both burst into laughter in silence,Cilan sighs shaking his head) and who are bros Cili never friends and most importantly Cili who the hell are you(both laugh in silence)”
Cilan(frwon) : “yeah I see your sweet sweet Gengleye must have told you the tea they just had with you was a bit warm so the dinking process tickled certain nevres giving the impression of warmth only cause you know had it been cold it would’ve tickled differently thus you must give up this sanity of medium of tickling to be free as the essence of essentially aesthetic tickling(both uncontrollably laugh in silence,Mehadi in tears and fits of laughter)”
Seth(laugh,frwon) : “impressive is your progress Cili in literature that dispells the darkness that shrouds the place in-between friendship and bonhomie(both laugh in silence,Cilan sighs) but you see Cili if your Gyaradosy ‘mam(both laugh in silence,Cilan sighs) really did like me she would’ve scoffed at me saying why 2.5 years at Unova not 25 you brat the longer is the separation the stronger is the reconcillation cause the re with still concillation is only to get it to be the most ENDEARING(both burst into laughter in silence,Cilan sighs)..”
Cilan(sigh) : “ Seth,look first the whole world knows you for ages for your created world with pokemons that just keeps on giving to all,all your close friends that according to you surpasses friendship..”
Seth(frown) : “according to who Cili be precise(both laugh in silence)..” Cilan(irritated) : “yeah Greninja’s Kalos wisdom previously dormant now with the brat having entered your pad(both laugh a lot in silence) that which according to Heracrossian manual of reality takes you beyond relationships of all objectivity and subjectivity that is definable as this to the rather supple lands of beau combinatorics(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence,Mehadi in tears and fits of laughter  oy)..and with your recent antics and career and all and your labs findings you’ve touched every possible sectors of this world and hence all wants a piece of you and you ever give them that despite them all times cause your brats do if you can’t(both laugh in silence) but I know you’re not happy somewhere inside and will be choosing either self destruction or go out of profession which you can’t thus only the self destruction route is left which if you take Seth I tell you you won’t be happy there either cause I surely know how madly you cherish her and now also how madly she cherishes you cause after Brock called I called Ariel to know if your venerables were involved too(both laugh in silence) he said for the whole time so I realized you didn’t make it easy before those words that Brock told me of and myself being subject to Unova and now I know what it will take to take upon 235 such once in two millenia legends thus how much ‘mam cherishes you I’ve come to know extremely well(both laugh in silence) and exactly that’s not going to sit well with you cause you understood that as well if I’ve from Unova(both laugh a lot in silence) in the end it’s just that..” Seth(frown) : “how exactly do you know all this facts on beau vs bro Cili how(both laugh in silence)” Cilan(sigh) : “yeah too much bonhomie with words today(both laugh in silence)..man I’d know your mental states from any world as would Dr Oak(both laugh a lot in silence saying has come ON-THE-FLY)..
Seth(frown) : “and the reason is..”
Cilan(angry) : “yeah the integral conservation of temporally derivable honest tickling(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence,Mehadi in fits and convulsions of laughter and in tears laughing)..and these exactly these sort of brats are why you’re never happy personally(both laugh a lot in silence saying not professionally in personal terms on-the-fly looping over bushes that feel)..cause you can’t live a singular life this term no matter and hence need your soulmate and you more than anyone know it’s not your brats literal at human level(all laugh),and as for the brats you don’t have any match in the world irrespective of time and space cause your systems have long surpassed them and beyond as long as the word pokemon is concerned..”
Seth(frown) : “thus that word must have no match with respect to me haven’t you been to Rofhursotram Planes Cili where Dialga presentated the grand discourse of asking something to a professor means you want to know it but thus how your confusion is cleared cause you’re only assimilating the answer not becoming it cause you can’t as it’s not your’s exactly why you should continue to ask it cause else you won’t know whether your confusion is a true confusion at all or not cause if the confusion is not true then it’s not a confusion at all like if you don’t know what is mind it’s not a confusion at all cause you can’t ask the question otherwise cause you’ve just recalled it using mind thus you should ask why I have a mind shouldn’t you Mr Cubin that too a sincere one so concerning ain’t it especially on certain dates of bettering friendships(Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs in silence)”
Cilan(sigh) : “yeah these talks haven’t helped you in the special nights at no time I realize hence prolonging the call cause atleast it’s something to your BEAUTY(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence) and unless your sort out your personal mess you’re only ever going to remain unappy exactly like your damn Yveltal who asked me Mr Cubin this idea you have that you’re a not not male forces you to know who then are the not males thus creates this whole mess of sturctural unhappiness for both doesn’t it rhyming with Mr Skechit Mr Cubin whose that human Mr Cubin who(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence saying Mr Fox) these sort of pests aren’t giving you personal hapiness hence that are HUMAN(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence saying Dr jackal said halloww .sin I’m Mr Fox) cause professional challenge is non existent for you for ages now..do you understand anything that I just said without your sweet sweet Hoopie(both bursts into laughter in silence)?

illusions to me as well despite seeing him first hand day after day,now much better with you he is I understand I just never understood his side properly and knew of the break-up hence thought you just were pushed beyond your limits till I contacted him again during his Unova Elite4 challenge in the final weeks where I understood his them almost saturated level and then have been seeing him for

12.and finally Cili according to their wishes Infesting of Kalos and Unova is to be done with Spiritombs(Mehadi laughs and Cilan silently laughs as well) and Kanto-Unova only Muks right beside Karapaskar Wetlands at AH!UNOVA!CILIVA!(Mehadi laughs and Cilan also laughs in silence shaking his head)
...so these are the 13 resolutions keeping in mind the number for myself(laughs,Mehadi too laughs,Cilan laughs shaking his head)..”
Cilan(laugh) : “yeah understood my mistake of calling you now not ‘mam(all laugh)..” Seth(laugh) : “cause AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all laugh) despite gym leading cosmetics aging flower dream is nothing to beauty given my activities with um..can’t you rhyme Cili..(Mehadi laughs in silence)” Cilan(sigh) : “man you’re going be 42 coming January you know(both silently laugh)..just get rid of your translators these aren’t always welcome in personal life(both laugh a lot in silence saying professionally),anyway,be happy with ‘mam,’mam thank you for your kindness,and I just got very excited if my poor little bro’s fortune has turned..and he’s always like this ever childish may you be kind to him(both laugh)..I beg your pardon for calling at this time..” Mehadi(smile) : “it’s alright Cilan,I’m so happy that you called..it’s just thank you.’night and take care.” Cilan(smile) : “thanks..”
Seth(frown,fake growl) : “KOMMO-O”(Mehadi laughs silently) Cilan(angry) : “Seth,don’t disturb ‘mam and CUT THIS LANGUAGE(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence,tears,Mehadi has fits and convulsions of laughter in silence)..that curse isn’t leaving Unova bye..(both laugh a lot)”
..................
Seth(laughing) : “(growl and frown) JANGOMO-HAKAMO-KOMMO-O(both uncontrollably laugh)..Hoopi pi pi Oh my Mehadi(both burst into laughter)..man when Kimmie used to stay beside this room with me,Kuzu,Gary and Stashey at 4 it was something you know(both laugh a lot)..(smile,few moments later)really Mehu,Cerulean shall see how to be a proper admirer..(laugh)beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful..(both bursts into laughter)..”
Mehadi(laugh) : “there’s no sleep Seth(both laugh),and(smile, oy firmly)..I don’t want to at all..you really is all that’s me..(Seth hugs Mehadi firmly and tenders her head smiling)..exactly like Trace isn’t he Seth(broadly smiles at Seth  im firmly,Seth nods and smiles at Mehadi  er firmly,both continue to smile at each other for a few more moments in same pose)..”
Seth(same pose smile) : “eternally my elder bro(both broadly smiles)..only the physical distance cause Kanto doesn’t have dragons Mehu,nothing else just the same Cili is exactly as Trace and Brock combined leaning towards Trace almost 80%,if was a researcher would’ve been here day one,fled then just didn’t get us neither would’ve Trace there nor Brock and they didn’t get me or Kuzu as you saw none except Gary would’ve I knew that may be not even my mom,she you know being my mom and given herself won’t leave me,dad himself might’ve had some troubles exactly as Professor had same for my mom in law,Gary never in a million years and beyond Mehu independent of his knowledge of me since day 0 same as Margin no matter how sweet he is as a person you surely now know the firmness behind him else that brat would’ve killed him day one no else nothing(both laugh) and the reason is same as Gary it’s only that Trace,Brock,Cili and the rest like Tony and Jaheemy they’re just too affectionate in nature with Jaheem and Tony and most others they ever have this idea that I’m their elder bro and they behave like that as you know with Oliv how it is or Steller or Siren and else,Gary and Dave different personalities Iris was taken aback only because she’s too much sweet like May and you saw them all fine till their bro chides them firmly same stuff Dave can stand against me sans emotions as much as Gary can and all like my big sis but Cili has maintained a distance cause we just love this relationship of ours he loves to be bashed around like this by his little bro me the same as I did with Brock at Kanto I can’t think of Unova being separated from my most dear Cili and Unova is just a figure of speech as Kanto was with Brock(laugh,Mehadi smiles  oy) surely you understand my sweet Gengy and Sablie has surpassed the bind of all psychophysical families very very long back don’t you dear(smiles at Mehadi in same pose,Mehadi broadly smiles at Seth  im firmly)..but man the whole world authority is too afraid of me getting my hands on Kommo-O(both laugh)..that would be maddening for sure wish I had him with Mr Andrum(both laugh)..”
Mehadi(a bit concerned,few moments later) : “but um,Seth,I just recalled I called you selfi..” Seth(smile,puts his hand on Mehadi’s mouth then lets her go  er very firmly,Mehadi smiles at Seth and hugs him very firmly smiling) : “Mehu,I’m always selfish cause I want to be totally Mehadivious..(both hug each other very firmly smiling for a few moments)..and this is the doseage for me as well(smiles at Mehadi,Mehadi smiles  im firmly)..I just want this sweetie my sweet Mehu flower ever beaming all in glee nothing else here at this plane honey just me just my sweet Mehadi Ketchum(hugs Mehadi very firmly smiling,Mehadi also hugs Seth very firmly and smiles,few moments later)..(laugh)..besides Mehu we’ve forever been eavesdropped remember across the bushes of age related tickling(both bursts into laughter)...” Mehadi(clap and smile) : “Bravo to vultures(both laugh),no first you abducted me second we married third we had to pass a sleepless first night due to Hoot-Hoots..(laugh)” Seth(laugh) : “see vulture is a better word” Mehadi(smirk,tendering Seth’s cheeks) : “Its vulpic,only that you’re not allowed to use it” Seth(smile) : “right(phone rings Violet),Violture got the never blocked number time to (rhyms as Hoopa pa pa)..I’LL INSINUATE IN THAT FEELING(shows phone and laughs,Mehadi shakes her head again laughing)..” Seth(smile): “No Mehu,go help Mom or take rest here,just want to play a bit with our sweetest Ms Volbeat had to be Slated(laughs,Mehadi laughs a lot),Villie Villie Villie Villie..(both laugh),no its ok she’ll be fine you know Kuzu obviously pestered her most among my sweet sweet sisters(both laugh) barring Daisyl ofcourse that’s common target(both laugh a lot)..as that's just DAISYDEVIL(both laugh..lot) but my target has ever been mind the name Lillie flower(both laugh) atleast Viol flower is a bit more accustomed to what she revolts against the self(both laugh..lot) plus Brock has become THE absolute pet if he wasn’t before that is says Boulder(both laugh),I’m talking all day since yesterday(both laugh),let me get this,later if she wants you can..” Mehadi(tendering Seth’s cheeks) : “don’t threaten her,she’ll go full Mantine(both laugh) and don’t take too much strain” Seth(laugh) : “DIALGA DON’T BE A GAMBLER JUST FOCUS ON THIS CHIME/OF YOUR MIND TELLING YOU SOMETHING BUT WHILE FOCUSING DIDN’T YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT’S THE DUAL TIME(both uncontrollably laugh,..)..man you know whatever they said about us and the temporal scale this isn’t happening man this is something else just imagine this name VERILY MUDROOM(both uncontrollably laugh,..)” Seth(smile,calls Violet back,few minutes later after Mehadi leaves) : “greetings Mrs. Violet Waterflower Slate,it’s truly such a great honour to be able to speak to you after 5 long years,how may an insignificant being like me come into your service?” Violet(emotional) : “um..Seth it’s ok but Brock..” Seth(smile) : “my sweetest Viol sis,I just told him that I also was suffering as much for Mehu,but wasn’t sure if she really was my soulmate or not no matter the years just like her and also told him about the papers whose antics you know infinitely more than me” Violet(emotional) : “Seth,I had no doubts ever about Blossie being just my own big sis but I didn’t want to know that her twin was as much and you will understand the reason the best but I must say sorry Seth that you..” Seth(smile) : “Viol please enough with these we’ve spent 18 years before the 5 it’s ok sis these things happens in family my only wish was that Chansbert wasn’t involved nothing else..” Violet(smile) : “Brock told me about him..she will get my babies as well thus be cured I know that(chokes in joy)..” Seth(smile) : “yeah we wish existence was kind on us but well(laugh) the vultures won’t even if consciousness is (laughs a lot,Violet smiles)..” Violet(smile) : “it was amusing what Brock told me that you said,I should’ve been there as well..” Seth(smile) : “it’s ok Viol,you know all of it anyway..what I told you about not being able to recognize your baby sis is just cause of her new surname(laugh,Violet smiles)..and well I shall be the one to beg your pardon Viol cause of everything since Unova but I won’t cause all the while we all had to feel it thus weren’t remotely adulterated ourselves(laugh a lot,Violet smiles and says,never even if the thoughts were ever there too honey never doubt)..surely sis definitely from my part too no matter the form(both smile)..but anyway enough with these how are you now..” Violet(smile) : “only best now(both smile)



yeah,um..thanks Seth,but um..I’m just so happy that Mehu indeed ever cherished the right man,soulmate and..um..” Seth(smile) : “Violet,it’s alright,if I were you I would’ve done the same if not way way worse don’t bother about it all illusion and thus a play between us the family starts for no reason ends for the same and you can understand best what I’m talking about nothing has gone out anywhere just a skirmish of beloved beings and soulmates and we passed only 22,27 more is in front of us atleast for sure,only best days ahead...” Violet(smile) : “yes Seth,that’s for sure,thanks and I again congratulate you two” Seth(smile) : “thank you Violet,thank you.by the way how’s your health and all all fine?” Violet(smile) : “yeah,I’m very fine and happy as ever with Brock and he the same in fine health just too busy I’m as usual and it’s viral(both laugh),anyway I’ll have to go now,will call Mehu at the earilest and take care both of you.” Seth(smile) : “yeah take care Violet and take your time,best wishes.Bye.” .....(Mehadi and Torrie downstairs)…
Torrie(bit concerned) : “dear,you look a bit worn out..”
Mehadi(smile) : “um..no just too much talking mom it's ok..”
Torrie(points out Mehadi’s ring) : “so happy,Mehu,your officially Ketchum now..”
Mehadi(smile) : “thanks Mom..”
Torrie(bit concerned) : “did he fetch that before..”
Mehadi(laughing) : “yeah both did”
Torrie(bit concerned) : “they've changed completely in these last 4 years since they returned from undercover,too playful and carefree and their language is a bit too direct now even comparing to what it has ever been since they turned 4.5 probably(Mehadi laughs,Torrie too laughs)..but Seth especially never used to talk so much Kuzu has only increased the output(both laugh..lot) but Seth was rather more abstruse unlike this directness now barring the Judiciary and Police and all those heads and their secretaries(both laugh..lot) and that has made sure that isn’t polite at all no more subtly like previous rhymes I can sense..(laugh,Mehadi laughs a lot)”
Mehadi(laughing) : “um..sorry mom but,um..as you said is exactly true about his language and yeah now doesn’t hesitate to rhyme all the time like Mime(both laugh)..no mom it’s just that he has found something higher than his previous states hence more assured of what he ever says beyond the despondency of being lies my real nature like pokemons(smiles looking at her ring,Torrie too smiles), umm..but he’s just a bit rough with this directness and that has to do with all that has happened to him in 5 years with the press and spotlight and all the undercover and else..he’s just a bit tired but won’t stop doing what he’s upto till he is satisfied as you know none can stop the obsession with indifference and differece(both laugh)”
Torrie(laugh) : “well,he surely knows how to scare people”
Mehadi(laugh) : “that I have to agree with,but it’s ok mom,you know him too obsessively cantor as ever and the press has only pressed that button breaking it hence these arrangements(both laugh),it’s ok mom,just needs rest and more um..(blushes,Torrie smiles and pats Mehadi)”
Torrie(smile) : “his eversweet Mehu flower(smiles and hugs Mehadi,Mehadi smiles)..sure with my honey surely he will be truly him(both smile) but Mehu,when are you going out today?”
Mehadi(laughs) : “you mean date?” Torrie(a bit concerned) : “um..yeah but is everything.." Mehadi(laughing..lot   Torrie) : “no mom,don’t worry at all the press hasn’t been kind to him,so he still just thinks that he has to logically validate every moment of his life and give it step by step in a logical manner to anybody and everybody concerned in a rather colourful way and this whole process in his mind will give the press a good beat-down along with his Hoopa who as you know is claimed to have infinite knowledge in extracting the exactly right meanings(laugh,Torrie shakes her head laughing) and this is to expose the press to the utmost whom he refers to as Vultures obviously(both laugh..lot)”
Torrie(laugh and concerned) : “no it’s ok Mehu I understand..but you should get this trash talking checked,it’s not at all good” Mehadi(laughing..) : “I’m being right at it mom cause he does it all the time with me now(laughs..lot,Torrie laughs..shaking) but it’ll take time,he had just been living a lonely life in his emotions only with his bunch too much thus,it’ll just take him some time to come into terms with his new surroundings”
Torrie(laughing..) : “yeah certainly has to live in a home after 37 years now finally unlike almost all of his family in rhymes(both burst..)..but still it's Gary's home anyway(both burst..)..but enough about him,how are you honey?”
Mehadi(smile) : “fine mom,just fine”
Torrie(looking at Mehadi’s ring holding her hand) : “very beautiful..but Mehu,you should take rest as well,you youself weren’t in a good health and much emotion overnight..”
Mehadi(smile) : “I’m fine mom,I’ve had too many sleepless nights because of the Gym and other things recently as you know and moreover I’m habituated like that for the past 5/6 years,rather last night was the best sleepless night till date”
Torrie(smile) : “happy to know honey,but um..Seth might also not be prepared to take you out as he thinks that the press..”
Mehadi(laugh) : “um..sorry for laughing mom,but it’s just the effects of his antics throughout the night..I’ve been entertained beyond imagination,but no he has refused to take me out on a date or to dance or giving me a flower bouquet especially that(both laugh..lot)-refusal in all accounts..he would rather runaway with me to unknown destinations” Torrie(smile) : “too much imagination(Mehadi un..),no Mehu,he’s fine at home you know all here..” Mehadi(laughing   Torrie) : “mom,its just that press bug that’s bitten him for such a long time and to such an extent,he just can’t yet get over it,so thats his definition of complete solitude”
Seth(outside) : “Mom,food,and overwork that little Mimey of yours, don’t let MY FLOWER(both laugh..lot) work atleast today,only i..um,I just want her with me right now else I’ll zap right upon her head(Mehadi laughs a lot,Torrie too laughs shaking her head)” Torrie(smile) : “also Mehu too(Mehadi laughs),remember that,and leave Mimey alone”
Seth(irritated) : “mom,please,but,if you don’t allow me to um..well..gaze at Mehu all I want from..um..close quarters,then I’ll get Mime to battle properly,there you little brat..” Torrie(frown) : “Seth, that’s impolite,and leave Mimey right now.” Seth(wrestling with Mime,comes near) : “Mime is pestering me ever since..why you little brat,you’re no good for..mom where’s my food?” Mehadi(surprized) : “where are you going?” Torrie( taking Mime away,scowl&frown) : “Seth wait there in the table,Mehu will take your foods there,and don’t runaway with Mehu so quickly(laugh)” Seth(dissapointed) : “yeah,so you’ve also decided that I should be away from Mehu..” Torrie(frown,comes to Seth) : “what’s wrong with you honey?calm down,your always too agitated,too active all the time,Mehu is coming,let her prepare the dishes..” Seth(irritated,sitting) : “Mehu come quickly,and why can’t Mime prepare the dishes and no I’m a bit excited due to certain vultures that is anyway,I’m going to the farm” Torrie(frown) : “Seth,just wait here and be calm honey,I’ve got to ask you something” Mehadi (comes with dishes) : “here are the..(Seth tries to take off the dishes and hug Mehadi)..Seth,what are you..” Torrie(frown) : “Seth..”
Seth( ehadi firmly) : “Ah..that’s what I want my sweet sweet flower,and no going a bit later..”
Mehadi(scoffs) : “Seth,mom is here,stop this!” Seth( ehadi more firmly) : “mom knows I’ve ever had only you in my mind and that too as my long married wife only and nothing else so it never has been a vulgar stu..” Mehadi( oy quickly,then scoffing) : “that’s it.Seth,are you out of your mind?calm down,don’t make a fuss” Seth(sitting down) : “no I’m done,will eat very slowly and sorry mom and Silence” Torrie(frown) : “Mehu,just sit down honey” Mehadi(smiles) : “yeah,just these things..” (finally everyone sists down)
Torrie(observing Seth) “Mehu,can you tell me something,I don’t know much about training and battling but I do know Mimey through and through,what is wrong with Seth?”
Seth(dejected) : “Mom your not insin..um..suggesting that..” Mehadi(scoffs) : “Seth!just eat silently!” Torrie(very concerned) : “Mehu,please,why is he behaving like this,and no it’s not just now since the day he has returned,he’s been like that,Mimey’s too excited all the time and wants to play around so does all else,Pikachu seems pretty indifferent to Seth,what is it? Too much attunement to these Dark Types aren’t good Seth,you know so many psychic trainers say..” Mehadi(smile) : “no mom it’s ok please calm down I explaining,he’s a very special trainer as you know and hence he’s so important to the world..” Seth(scoff) : “Mehu is in..”
Mehadi(frown) : “Seth”
Seth(grim) : “very well,but mention yourself,she doesn’t know fully that you’re the best in water pokemon gym leader”
Mehadi(frowns at Seth,back to Torrie,smiling) : “Mom,his view of his pokemons have been that he must become them in order to know them as well as himself and thus as he has grown up in all quarters he is at this level where as you said his pokemons are doing things totally independent of him and his presence alone gets Mime to be so happy and that’s all cause he wants to fool around all the time you know the mental battling phase during Unova with Tyranitar(Seth and Mehadi both laugh) that has propelled all to hight of powers no more can be done for them in this body thus too happy knows the inevitabilities and like ideal perfect human happy life living in own being thay are such in pokelife(both laugh,Torrie smiles) hence these behaviours and all and Seth has same view just that he had to finally marry me officially after 23 years(both laugh)”
Torrie(bit concerned) : “but Mehu..um..Chu..” Mehadi(smiles) : “no mom don’t worry,Pikachu is an exception due to his own temperament and he can’t be automatically affected just by Seth’s presence,he has to be be warmed up cause he is his starter and ever has bossed around him as big bro(all laugh) thus is rather critical now that he doesn’t battle(all laugh) that is in their words a good conference with a few Choiced ones(all laugh) he being the starter knows all of Seth’s moods since the beginning just too well hence with his attitude that one must starve the longest to get the greatest joy(all laugh) is actually getting tested by Seth who has restrained him thus(all laugh) but being starter he is different to say Mime..” Torrie(bit flustered) : “um..well..I see but with all this attunement Seth must be lonely..” Seth(bursting into laughter) : “of course he was lonely but now (smile) he has his sweet flo(Mehadi frowns)..umm(showing Mehadi the ring,smile) I HAVE Mehu floWER (smirks at Mehadi who shakes her head) but when too lonely,which by the way I would if you or Mehu don’t bear with me and I don’t get to hug my flower all I want(Mehadi frowns at Seth,Seth smirks)..and both of you don’t bear with my now much beloved language which took 4 years of very hard work to process(Torrie and Mehadi sigh and laugh)..(smile)..yeah right 4 University Lectures on the subject soul and saw some souls in lecture room itself as well(all laugh) and that was general public accessible so(all laugh),then unless I have my WAYS(laugh,Mehadi shakes her head laughing,Torrie too laughs) I’ll become more playfull and so would Mimey,so you see we have a deal..” Mehadi(frown) : “Seth,stop that,don’t talk like this with mom.” Seth(grim) : “yeah the impending big sis from academia(Mehadi laughs shaking her head)..those..anyway,mom I’m never harmful..” Torrie(smile) : “no honey,you never can but are you not going to obey your mommy because your all powerfull now?” Seth(grim) : “yeah like Meowth(Mehadi and Torrie laughs shaking their heads)” Torrie(laugh) : “just remember that press will not be after you unless you yourself wish them to and even if the press is around you still you don’t have to give rigorous motives behind your each actions get it? Seth(grim) : “as well as would any Salandit yeah(Torrie laughs and Mehadi bursts into laughter)” Torrie(laugh) : “excatly hence Mehu herself will talk about her(both laugh)..” Seth(grim) : “yeah an intellectual Clauncher(both laugh)..so I should just..” Mehadi and Torrie unison(laugh) :”Shut Up!(both laughs)” Seth(grim) : “yeah unlike any college bully Slurpuff(both burst into laughter)” Mehadi(laugh) : “yeah hence only MENTALLY(all laugh a lot), and um.. mom as you know I’m in hall of fame now as a water pokemon gym leader in Kanto this is same status as he has as a Pokemon Master hall of fame from Kanto..” Seth(grim) : “resigned be precise(both laugh)” Mehadi(laugh) : “Seth, didn’t we agree that you’ll be silent?” Torrie(laugh) : “and to deflect attention from what is that special honour imputed(both laugh)” Seth(grim) : “reflectively Mehadiviousy activities why(both laugh a lot)” Torrie(laugh) : “so now just stay such and contemplate(laugh,Mehadi blushes,Seth smirks at her,all laugh,Mehadi shakes her head laughing)” Seth(smile) : well Mehu is THE BEST IN THE 7 REGIONS,no please Mehu,bear with me,please..” Torrie(smile) : “ok Mehu,I’ll bear with his language,besides I must know what my little daughter has done too in details(Mehadi smiles),please Mehu,this time, let’s just bear with him together,but Seth,if you cross the line,I’ll not listen to you for this entire day” Seth(sticking his toungue out to Mehadi) : “hum..Roserade!” (everyone burst into laughter)
Seth(smile) : “Mehu is currently THE TOPMOST water pokemon gym leader in 7 regions (frown) INCLUDING Unova(Mehadi laughs) but I’m having to add the dreaded term ‘may be’ still as long as whole of 7 regions are concerned as otherwise the vultures will insinuate that(Torrie and Mehadi shake their heads)..(smiling) yeah, that’s called THE ELOQUENCE(Torrie,Mehadi both laugh)..anyhow,the vultures will insinuate that there are 7 godda..um..sorry..goddamn(laugh,both laughs shaking their heads)..7 regions in this world where things are vastly different,Cerulean,a name that I’m not too..(Mehadi frowns) disappointed about(Mehadi laughs) as it’s associated with my sweetie sweetie..(Mehadi sighs,Torrie laughs,smile)..my sweet Mehu flower(laughs,Torrie laughs,Mehadi shakes her head and laughs),being a seaside city-open ocean in fact-its kinda easy,kinda natural,kinda understandable,kinda taken for granted that the Gym,if there is an authorized one,will be a Water Pokemon gym and if Shamrockmoss had a water pokemon Gym then suddenly to the vultures it becomes a problem that because the Geography is different,so is Pokemon and so the trainers are a bit different,bit varied,bit diversed(Torrie and Mehadi laughs),but I’ve been everywhere,I’ve never seen a 25 year old kid being able to handle a..um.. whatever Gyarados(Mehadi laughs shaking her head) just like that(all laugh a lot) to the extent where she made it like Mime is to you mom,at the age of 25 and that too within a month after she alone had to tame it and why it was far more difficult to do than say getting a Giratina from wild(Torrie and Mehadi laugh,frown)..no my flower is the best gym leader(Mehadi laughs shaking her head,Dela smiles)..no it is mom not for nothing has her name been so but yeah still I’ve to admit that whatever she had done is nowhere near what’s needed to go to Huntelion alone and get a KOMMO-O(all laugh)..and this is cause it's the only thing that even the feathered ones failed at jointly(all burst..),cause that dumb buffoon first instigated his Daisy flower to stay separated then couldn’t take it so followed suit in opposite direction(all laugh)..anyway,Mehu tamed it like you’ve with Mime in 23 years and she tamed it to this level in 2 months and on 3rd month her 6th overall attained a legendary status(Mehadi shakes her head and trying to stop Seth,Torrie smiles),no I won’t stop till I show the once only that you are(Mehadi laughs and shakes her head)..she’s THE best in water pokemon trainging as gym leader cause I’ve been to 1157 gyms including Cerulean(all laugh) and Unova thinks I’m from mars(all laugh) Mehu will become best gym leader in ANY TYPES(frowns,Mehadi laughs shaking her head,Torrie smiles) just let her unleash my bunch and the world will see what a Metapod can do to their sanity(all laugh)..surely(laughs,others laugh too) and Mehu’s Gyarados’s current form is a dragon but the day I first saw her Gyarados during our reunion at Hoenn that day Mehu was Ah,just her whole presence deluged me in..(Mehadi blushes after smirking at
Seth,Torrie smiles)..the spontenous thought of Mehu!Mehu!you’re so sweetie!(burst into laughter,Mehadi blushes and then shakes her head laughing,Seth smirks at her,Torrie laughs) just like Gyarados(all laugh) and with mainly her Gyarados absoluty single handedly turned a god..um..not so reputed Gym of Cerulean to a legendary gym with an elusive sort of name like Yellowburst(Mehadi smiles and Torrie pats Mehadi) the forsaken Cerulean vultures(Torrie and Mehadi frowns)..no I’ll say how they don’t want to give my flower the crown that is only her’s cause they’re too egotistical to imagine it..(Torrie smiles and pats a blushing Mehadi)..those Cerulean buffoons who yesterday had the audacity to imply to me that I’ve
deceitfully abducted Their flower,but the thing is that she’s MY ETERNAL FLOWER(Mehadi turns her head down blushing,Torrie smiles and hugs her)(smile) and the touble was that they would rather clap her to death than to help her to stand and then they..”
Torrie(sigh) : “Seth, it’s about Mehu,not your vultures..” (Mehadi shakes her head) Seth(smile) : “right,my eternally sweet Mehu flower(Mehadi laughs shaking her head and Torrie too laughs) can push her Gyarados now to a level which she told you about that is to be the most ENJOYING(laughs as Pikachu,Gengar,Sableye,Mr Mime and Greninja zaps in and each tickles Seth for a moment then zaps out,Mehadi and Torrie shake their heads laughing)..too much bonhomie(all laugh)..this she can do with her Gyarados just like that(all laugh) and then this Gyarados isn’t her strongest Pokemon at all,it is her Golduck and Dewgong and Jellicent and Sharpedo and Kyogre and Manaphy and Tapu Fini and Kaledo and Palkia and Volcanion and Carracosta and Suicune and Articuno and Rotom and Volcanion and Lanturn(Mehadi laughs and shakes her head)and Bruxish and Sharpedo and Tentacruel and Starmie and so on,she had Starmie at like 11 year birthday present..” Mehadi(smile) : “10”
Seth(smile) : “right,10 year present,and there are many more,she is an once ever talent in anticipation and thus grows in confidence with each passing moment of the match and that mind game which she does unknowingly is enough to kill off many great challengers including me SURELY(all laugh)so the vultures finally were about to budge as they would’ve abjectly humiliated themselves otherwise but the hallowed Cerulean City for the love of God never bothered,they wanted more and more and everyday every hour there would be this damn arrogant brat who’d challenge only to show(Torrie frowns and Mehadi laughs) that the brat was an once ever utter failure as a celebrated boy scout or sought after girl cheerleader(laughs,Torrie scowls and Mehadi frowns)..no let me continue..(closed eyes,smile)..THE ELOQUENCE(laugh,both Torrie and Mehadi laugh)..but my flower still had to appease those brats by giving them a badge and fighting them which obviously didn’t last even a second as they used Metapod against Gyarados(both Mehadi and Torrie laughs)..which is a rather known move(all laughs),anyway still out of her generosity my flower gave them a badge as she did to me otherwise I would’nt have been able to continue my career(Mehadi laughs shaking her head and Torrie too laughs)..sweet sweet DaisyDaisyl(all laugh,Torrie shakes her head laughing) and this badge they got will be the only ever in their goddamn lives and thus my flower was getting drained more and more mentally and physically and all that the all caring idiotic Cerulean might was doing was to cheer her slow death.”
Torrie(concerned) : “Mehu,I heard about your success to an extenet and also that you weren’t well,but this really was too much..”
Mehadi(smile) : “mom,you know he’s just exaggerating,I’m fine now,and no had he been there at this form of his(laughs,Torrie also laughs)..I wouldn’t have needed to work or perform at all,money would’ve poured into the Gym simply by this rate of trash talking even with wife and mother in this language(Torrie shakes head,Seth laughs),long live the vultures Seth,really just like Cradily..(Mehadi and Torrie bursts into laughter)
Seth(smile) : “good break,thanks for the refreshments Mehu and especially sweet for me(Mehadi shakes her head laughing),and this will be long just as any Groudon..” (Mehadi and Torrie again bursts into laughter)..anyway,then there was the king of brats is the neighbouring Frontier Symbol.this brat conspiring with our well known Cerulean all-knowers, tried to defame my sweet Mehu flower there butthen as I’ve told you,my flower is more than strong enough to topple any goddamn weed pretending to be trees,and so this frontier Symbol had to be put over upon my sweet flower,which she barely was able to manage as it’s like two gyms in one building and you can understand the workload that my flower had to bear alone and then the Cerulean brats quadrupled with this double gym system(both laughs)and finally these idiots came with a new plan,they were sending..(solemn)..Mehu this will become personal” Mehadi(frown) : “Seth, just give it a break,would you?” Torrie(concerned) : “what did they do to my little doll Seth?” Seth(solemn) : “Mehu, you’re seeing my moods but mom needs to know,though she doesn’t believe it but still she must’ve heard it the umpteenth time and therefore about us and especially you she has an idea..” Torrie(scoff) : “Seth,are you..” Mehadi(sigh) : “not again,Seth,I’m not going to listen” (hugs Torrie)” Seth(solemn) : “Mom,you’ve taught me to be honest with myself first,you want to see that today?” Torrie(frown) : “I understand,yes,Mime,don’t allow anyone in at any cost no matter who,Mehu,dear you’re too tired go to my room and have a nap..you too Chu,Gengy,Ninjie,Sablie just protect the house but don’t go overboard(Gengar,Greninja,Sableye,Mime and Pikachu leaves)Mehu..no it’s ok honey your’re too tired..” Seth(smile) : “Mom,just a minute,please..hold on..Mehu,just a sec sweetie,won’t you be able to bear with me?”
Mehadi(sigh) : “um..no it’s ok mom,I’m alright.and Seth don’t go overboard.” Torrie(sternly) : “Seth don’t..”
Seth(smile) : “please mom,just bear with me,she’ll be more than fine,yes Mehu you can put your head down on the table or lie there in the sofa,just make sure you hear our conversation clearly and cogitate as we did yesterday.”
Mehadi(puts her head down) : “make it bearable” Torrie(frown) : “I see,(hugs Mehadi)..it’s ok Mehu you’re with you mom(Mehadi hugs Torrie)..” Mehadi(dejected) : “tell him not to repeat it again mom,whole night this was relaying with my sisters and all.” Torrie(frowns at Seth,tendering Mehadi) : “Seth,you heard her and I’m telling you not to cross any limits as well..” Seth(solemn) : “that’s done mom.”
Torrie(frown) : “Mehu is my child just like you and has been for 22 years in my mind no matter what and you know the best that I don’t have any reservations about her,but if you’re so bent on proving your points to anyone,then say,but as Mehu and I also said,this is the very last time you’ll ever repeat this”
Seth(solemn) : “MOM,I got you.it’s done as you say,mom.right,Mom you know about Kalos incident and you also know I was kissed or(disdainfully) rather spat at from blank full of untreated cough(Torrie frowns) accidentally in public,and many times these stunts were performed on me during undercover cause they could’nt beat my bunch so beat me in emotional vulgar games at which they never want to succeed it was their delusion as was mine but the vultures tried their hand at succeeding(frown,Torrie sighs and shakes her head)..and these were accidents
and before them there was one kiss and that was the first for us both- me and my sweet Mehadi – that was the first time I did that on my own wish as her wish also matched mine on that day and our wish matched a few times more after that till we broke-up then and these had nothing to do with psychophysical ideas(frown)..Mehu has ever cherished me almost from the first sight as have I and you know all of it,but..this is funny and please bear with me..then the vultures started to peek around me especially after the Sinnoh Miracle,as you know and no I didn’t cheat on her but my ego that I’m honest thus everything is taken for granted and I can not care thus about people sucking who I’ve reached my level and no my bunch is the reason but only I don’t look after my bunch there’s the whole lab and then Brock and all and mostly Mehu without whom it makes no sense to me of anything but that ego of being honest with myself swelled a bit too much and eventually we separated,the real fun starts now,so the Cerulean brats came up with a particular plan that now since my flower depressed and alone,these would circulate over and you knowmom,the irony is that I wasn’t there at all,I was in heaven,well according to the vultures,anyhow,both she was mentally tortured beyond measures by the vultures and they were circling around me as well but while I could travel around she was confined to her gym and show which is a golden cage with the responsibility to poslish it every damn day so that more damn brats may get in in the name of Gym battling and thus vultures got a way bigger  grip on her than they ever could has or will get over me cause this language,so then you know we broke up and we took the same measure in different froms,she continued to withdraw herself,I continued to attack them..the only thing was that I was moving around so I in a way was in much more favourable condition,which um well..helped me to anticipate if anybody wanted to fall for me which she was NOT DOING,and to cut the long story short,you’re seeing that except for my flower none did bear with me through THE hell and you know exactly what hell I’m talking about(Torrie frowns,solemn)..she has been hearing me spit this out to whoever that dared to challenge me and my flower yesterday(Torrie frowns)-no it was Brock,Trace and Daisy,all family-got thrown at some Choiced logic mercilessly by me,but it hurts her,no only Daisy,Tracey,Brock and Lillie got this, they’re all family,so it’s not that the vultures can do anything about or with it..it’s just to keep you informed what did happen-yesterday I insulted Mehu like I could never dream myself and did that again and again and again and again she came back with the hope that we can reconcile.Mom,I’ve seen may b.. and no they were b.. certainly above the cover more than under so I won’t restrain(Torrie frowns) and other people but her devotion to me for absolutely no reason since the age of 17 when she first had a gimplse of me till now for 22 years constant for which she was on the verge of total destruction,this devotion made me submit to her and she will go through any hell for me because of absolutely nothing,I didn’t speak with her very gently,I haven’t done anything good to her in all 17 years since we left for Johto atleast,I broke-up and went away leaving her to get tortuted beyond measures by all and still she for some reason won’t ever leave me no matter who I was and where I’m in whatever conditions may it be she come back to me just for no reason except that she cherishes me since that very first meeting when both of us were 17 and since that very first sight all she knows about me is- ‘Seth’-just as you know and that’s why we are where we are(Torrie smiles).and that’s exactly what she was ever even after our breakup,when I told her to get into general training at Johto else no point travelling with me cause as you know as she did then even as much is that I won’t stop for anyone cause that idea itself will hinder my pursuit and that of my bunch..and Mehu was like that till I refused to come down from abstraction all time,when the Cerulean brats were hovering around the most for spit and cough and after sometimes Mehu just couldn’t take anymore of it and just that break up happened in the illusion for both of us and then she just shut herself up in her room and only attending to pokemon and overworking to the ultimate all the while burning inside just for no reason except that I never came back after I broke up and it turned into a severe depression much to the joy of those brats and my sweet flower was dying a slow and miserable death all because she was hoping I’ll come back even if for only a moment someday,and finally I
returned but yet tortured her yesterday to every hell including that one and as many more I could imagine but she refused to let go off me but as soon as I smiled and put a gentle hand over her shoulder you can see the overnight change in her and this all she did while she herself is a legend in Hall of Fame of water pokemon gyms and infinitely many true great men would die to be her but she was only ever going to be mine cause she can’t be she if not me(smiles at Mehadi,Torrie too smiles at Mehadi and keeps tendering her,Mehadi still sitting with her hed down on the table).I’ve not ever been kind to her except leaving her high and dry when I thought 21 days wasn’t enough to marry her officially registering and then go to Unova atleast cause I to use the right language just the sentiment was b.. enough to be unable to restrain myself once I did that registration then or during Pasio break same much worse at Pasio break actually(Torrie sighs shaking her head) then all these 7 damn years she wouldn’t have suffered but anyway no matter what she is stubbornly following me ever since she first saw me and would do so no matter what as I told you just like you I’ve been all her since first sight..she has listened to what I’ve just told you throughout the night and yesterday also for the umpteenth time and yet she still agreed to go through that once again just now after going completely sleepless last night hearing this same being repeated again and again,the reason is because I told her to bear with me and I told her I don’t hide anything from my mom,so she’s bearing it now and will so too if I tell the same to the vultures no matter the consequences and no matter how many times she will do the same because I’m just her ‘Seth’ and there’s no other reason at all.I stopped her going as you were taking her away to your room just to give you the first hand experience of Mehu is all about to clarify all 6 years once more.so if you ever heard anything that the vultures told through their lackey the media about me believe all of it as being far less than what I was actually being,but as far as your daughter goes,you can aswell treat it no matter what and how serious it is as a mere dust particle on the most precious once only jewel..yes Mehu agreed to date 8 times with 3 different people each time cancelling it before leaving home in a very direct and stern language if they kept lingering about it and all these were cause of her confusion..her whole life has been woven around her Seth and once there was confusion there she just didn’t know how to live hence these attempts that just vapourized as soon as they fell in the warmth of her soul that she has for me and who she really is..no I’ve met all three of those men who has only respect for her now and they all realized their illusions then and there all happy now with their own family and they are very successful people top notch professionals so it was possible for them to realize it..but these were all before I entered Sinnoh Elite4 more than a year ago 14 months to be precise and since then she had been living a life of unbearable mental agony till I just smiled at her and you now see the result..I made no mistakes leaving her cause I myself didn’t know what’s what but now do and hence for this term of life I’ve only found my eternal wife once more and may be this same pattern will follow again in future terms with more agony for her but she knows as do I that the end is this that she’s my wife and that’s how it will be as that’s the reality..still in gross terms I won’t tell you whether I reciprocate my flower’s feelings for me or not or whether I truly were sitting or attracting attention with the hope that I can get whoever I want,and thus the all conquering Cerulean brats and their master the vultures has once again just abjectly failed in another of their great endeavours.but they’ll be at it again but the only thing is that next time I’ll be more prepared too,anyhow,that’s the story”
Torrie(tendering Mehadi’s head) : “good enough Seth,but this is the last time you said this and if it’s not then..”
Mehadi(raising her head from the table,sigh) : “mom, that’s Seth’s power..” Seth(smile) : “sorry dear it’s not mine my Guzzlord’s(smile) honesty in ethical morality in ethics of honesty ingrained in morality of ethics of honesty in ethics an issue of morality never only(laugh)” Torrie(tendering Mehadi) : “ok let’s leave this nonsense and let him entertain his vultures all he wants” Seth(laugh) : “mom,please I’ll leave ,only if I can hug my flower um..the umpteenth time..” Torrie(tendering Mehadi,frown) : “do it more than that,but..” Seth(laugh) : “what Guzzy says(laughs a lot,Mehadi faint smile,Torrie laughs too shaking her head) is that I’ll trash talk people and tell them such bare truths which is Infernaped as ever true that is GIVE UP THIS SANITY TO BE FREE(laugh,others laugh as well) that the honesty of me if present and approved by my bunch will connect with them and their pokemons if pokemons are involved,and then if I want I can extract any secret I want cause that’s sanity ain’t it(laughs,others laugh shaking their heads)..and in the battle it’ll mean if you had Mimey and I came without any pokemons,5 such Mimes won’t cop with me cause they’ll want to play with me all the time and be my pokemon rather so what to speak if I have 235 best trained pokemons myself? Thus we don’t battle cause that word makes no sense to us and thus I can make people tell the absolute truth cause I had to face it from close stare and this’ll be if able to help you,you good,if not my bad.yes,the Mimes won’t include your Mimey cause she is included in 235 in a very special place hence never counted(Delis smiles and shakes her head)..no she can tame a Mexutu in her dream without battling and making friends with him as much as you will yourself have a Mexutu as your child but the condition is you can’t intrude in Mime’s process while she is taming and worry about her then she will think about you and won’t be able to do what I said she can so in such cases just let her do whatever she wants and stay at a distance without any worries as much as you can cause she can tame a whole herd of much higher legends than Mexutu just as well as anyone else of my buddies can.Mehu,you yourself or anyone else has the same powers but your temperaments are very different so may be you can never do what I’m upto,but your bunch will be able to do what my bunch does but in a different way and if two such pokemons meet there’s only friendship and you understand who their trainers would be if their bunch can do that so they won’t be Team Rocket 1 vs Team Roket 2.but those who think water pokemon trainers cant handle electeic types they may test Pikachu with Mehu and that’ll be their last sane day here..anyhow..I know many more things cause my bunch do as you know what I said cause what my bunch said to me isn’t achieved overnight or suddenly though that key moment is ever sudden but as a result only yet when it’s there none would remember the path to that cause the joy of being there will erase the joy during the path but also my cause of my bunch’s only weapon is that and you already know it as do Pikachu,Mime and so on,I took my flower through it only cusemy bunch was with me,and my flower follows me no matter what I do to her as I do with my bunch who mind it DOES NOT do what I did to my flower so I had to pick her up from the forsaken Cerulean City’s damn Gym and now has put here at my home which should’ve been officially done 17 long years back.this is where I live and my flower now is my family that is eternally always My sweet wife Mehadi Ketchum..” Torrie(smile) : “I get you,but your process is only good for your vultures,and yeah enjoy your time with your wife” Seth(smile) : “right.( ehadi very firmly) there there Mehu,you want to hear the flower song again no which was mine not Cerulean” Mehadi(blush, oy quickly) : “later” Seth(laughing, ehadi more firmly) : “mom can I fondle my sweet wife now yeah it’s vulgar but given the customs for eternity if freedom is granted with Heracrossian gospel at work it’s rather virtuous I guess..(burst into laughter,Mehadi laughs,Torrie laughs shaking her head)” Torrie(laugh,going away) : “have a nice day” Seth(smile, ehadi firmly) : “right,this I’ve wanted to do for 23 years..my sweet sweet Mehu..” Mehadi(laugh) : “Seth..”
Seth(same pose,picking Mehadi up) : “attitude?(both burst into laughter)..in front of mom(both burst into laughter again)..no first you keep  e otherwise I’ll take you to kitchen and won’t let you down(both laugh,Mehadi hugs Seth firmly and smiles)..my sweet Mehadi..(they keep ach other for a few moments then sits down on the couch,Seth hugs Mehadi and she rests herslf on Seth)..want to know whole 235(both burst into laughter)..ok,lets call mom too(laugh,Mehadi laughs and shakes her head)..”
(Torrie now present as Mr Mime zaps her in) Torrie(irritated) : “Seth,what is this..” Seth(  Torrie) : “mommy,don’t you want to know your little baby’s bunch in details?” Torrie( oy and kissing his forehead) : “go on,too happy today(all laugh)” Seth(sitting beside Mehadi) : “right then his flower’s water bunch(burst into laughter,Torrie and Mehadi laugh and shake their heads)..all food today will automatically REACH,cause incidentally you may know that I’m RICH(all laugh)..right,so we start,mom I’m just mentioning their types though that itself can be catergorized in 10000 parts may be(laugh,Mehadi laughs and shakes her head,Torrie laugh)..anyway, 1.my sweet Chu bro(all smile,Seth kisses and tenders Pikachu who reciprocates then goes to the others in rounds)..starter,electric type..just my bro ever always(all smile),male..starves to prolong a battle to make that moment like the end of a date to be the most ENGAGING(both burst into laughter,Torrie laughs shaking her head)..almost spoilt but too infatuated with me so kept a veil to protect me unnecessarily(all laugh) but when the opponent is more in number or too powerful uses this line exactly(all laugh)..utter brat this is(all laugh)..but now lets begin the DARK KNIGHTS(both burst into laughter,Torrie shakes her head),(calls Gengar and Sableye without words) 2.GENGAR(burst into laughter,others laugh and shake their heads,Gengar tickles and licks everyone then goes away to play with others-Sableye,Mr Mime,Greninja and Pikachu,Sableye,Mr Mime and Greninja too joined Gengar and Pikachu irritated all three and laugh,few minutes later),anything else(all laugh),ghost-poison..but has anyone ever asked a Gengar what is poison(all laugh),well for ghosts the only direct disadvantage is psychic and then they are independent to fairy types but posion types are strong against both so(all laugh)..and still it’s a Gengar(all laugh) and well Mimikyu is ghost fairy which is similar cause fairies are type strengthed against psychics too(all laugh)..these two brats are as you know has ever been in floklores cause of their legendary frivolity(all laugh),and well my Gengar has a compeer at arms in Sableye(all laugh)..who is more dangerous cause he teaches all how to be him and Gengar at the same time as he was trying to(all laugh)..he’s just like Genagar just a bit different,Gengar’s motto of a perfect Gengarian life is just 2 lines and absolutely nothing else it is best put as Gary so beautifully says is that Gengar has only this in his mind whole time,’what is this Gengar if full of care/we have no time to tickle and fare(all burst into laughter,Gengar,Mr Mime,Sableye,Greninja and Chu again zaps in and pesters them a bit then goes away again zapping out)..no more(all laugh)..,came from the next generation of my Haunter whom Sabrina has as you know,Hall of Fame gym leader at Marengo psychic and ghost types a legendary name really without whose knowledge and constant support I would never have been a pokemon master cause I never would’ve learnt about psychic types and she ever been too generous and warm to both me and Mehu(all smile)..her attitude of ever being a big sister to me and her is all cause her father was a famous psychic pokemon trainer and mom was out of profession,her dad was Mr Luther Marnold and he was a huge name in Marengo as you know one of the most famous places for psychic types.then the gym went to committee and Mr Marnold got that when Sabrina was 13 then she was 17 and travelled Kanto,Johto,Unova and Sinnoh same order that that brat Oskie followed ofcourse personally for professional views(all laugh) so that was her customery gym leader travels till 23 then returned and was leader from 23-24 was ok then from 23-25 she was so attuned to psychic types and her own personality being very introverted from beginning a hunger for more psychic power and control over other people and like hypnotism,Telekeneis,holding sway over other people despite their physical presence being far off but within a distance and so on then this is only helped by pokemons they don’t understand your motives they do what they do you try to connect to them and then they give you something and through them you do something but these makes the concerned person go totally insane after one point cause there’s a central reason behind these practises power hunger or so on that reason is to be satisfied thus the activities and with each success it will occur that this is highest but it’s not so it will be increasing the hunger thus all thoughts of sanity will go only this will remain eventually all powers are lost once there’s no sanity thus those can’t be taken by nerves will forget all processes and all and the subject become total lunatic and yeah I know all these too well along with my bunch but(laugh) all these are child’s play to me and my bunch to where roam around mom there’s negetive danger we can fool around with danger cause we don’t bother about about person too happy with ourselves thus that overflows to the others making them love us if they so want and our nature don’t change we’re as we are just the joviality increases if given a chance thus we have a great bond with people if they give us a chance and that is real psychic power not being a power at all cause all has it so there’s no point being serious and you all are no different to me thus the huge family and thus no psychic powers arenay good to us nor can they harm us at all cause we have no intention but to be happy ourselves(smile,others smile) and well these powers can come to a normal person without pokemons too if one follows particular practices which very high level trainers get to know of much not all still which requires one to be detached and all like Sabrina herself is or Zed or Sakura..it’s in the depths of contemplation and all stuffs high level trainers just use it to remain calm that’s all as their bunch becomes too sharp and then pokemons help if you have that strength of mind exactly why you scale the height of 5+ champ level or second nomination in gym leading or croos the 5% mark below distinction in special training..pokemon doctors and breeders has to know it especially breeders without this they can’t do their jobs that’s why breeding preparation takes such a long time doctors a bit less but still has to know much..researchers though they may or may not know about these at all unless for personal interests their job is with pokemons not the interactions but each human doctors absolutely must know these cause these affect the whole body and these help pokemons in a way too as you know but anyway,the trouble is that how you use it or not use it cause with these things you understand you get to much higher planes than say even a 4 time champ and that’s no easy feat either and then those who reach hall of fame and their to towards the top brass they become invinsible in a way with all these but if these get upto you and make you dishonest then eventually you’ll get totally mad and your bunch will either kill you themselves and then these powers will go away you will be uncurable thus the only thing to do with you is to if there’s consent from your family then just kill you as well cause you’re not more a human or even a pokemon or even an animal so you can’t live here your plane is different this body if goes you may feel better infact hence these..and no you can’t use these powers just become immune to them more or less in normal cases cause you know the mechanism but some can use it and does for various purposes and all as you know and most of them only does good to all wholeheartedly in treatments and all..but the central rule is that what do you want to do and if that becomes what the translators tell you then there’s much more left after these potentials and all hence you must never even bother about these powers just may read a bit to explore your experiences a bit and just that no more..and if you get to a level where you don’t care about these these become natural to you and there’s many more which we can’t say to absolutely anyone unless they are at same level and that only is permitted to your parents or spouse not even siblings unless they are like what Zed or Sabrina is that isn’t permission but you’ll know it’s just more beneficiary to you that’s all..and no I can talk about these with Mehu and has been for a very long time cause we both experience it and we have never been not spouses(all laugh)..hence after the break-up that I tell you again Mehu was all cause you weren’t in ponytails(all laugh)..no mom I refuse to admit that at 42 you can’t do ponytails(all laugh),anyway so as I was saying if you forget about these and don’t bother then you get much higher thoughts which help you by manifolds more and so on,anyway this exact phenomena was needed to cure Sabrina and then she became a gym leader at 23 picked up a creepy reputation at 26 and when we met was 27 was with that reputation for around 1.5 years by then and no was extremely good gym leader even before that since the beginnig just like Mehu was but challengers were scared to death cause she gave a picture of horror in their mind was ok from 23-25 first two years as a gym leader was a huge name already cause her talks and core nature just touched people even at that age comanned respect and that’s just respectful love nothing else as the reason for it is her unbounded love for all cause herself wants never to be subject of bound hence reached the states..was extremely good in gross training as well and infact the only desire like Zed’s perfect family that has made both to remain among them(all laugh) anyway,then next two years was unsual cause her behaviours started to became erratic slowly since 25 and still was ok till 26 but the last year especially from 26.75 to till when we met her was extremely serious issue,Lance told me later they were thinking of forceing her out to a mental assylum even and when we went there she was on the verge of real psychological trouble the gym having been red flagged for about 4 months and so on her parents were psychologically disturbed as well to much severity and already all others stuffs had left and two other hall of famers were managing her bunch supervised by Dennis himself who had just stepped down as you know beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful man..(all laugh),anyway even they had an extremely hard time the hall of famers only Dennis kept them stuck but he too was just observing 4 more months would’ve thrown Sabrina out and taken action then her last challenger before I first went left that day first half itself was in a serious problem and was a 6 time champ in last region buzzes were going on would this be it and then I walked in all said who the hell are you(all laugh),I said a challenger(all laugh),asks Brock are you too infatuated of is he just retard(all laugh),then points at my flower I said yeah who can travel with such too must be too die hard(all brust into laughter) so my flower was blushing like nothing(all laugh) and those brats said just contact the inside Dennis himself was there told me you can’t enter it’s a huge problem and did tell the stuffs in a way,then Brock said I’ve warned him several times won’t listen but my flower said..um..why are there 4 categories of psychics when they think of the same(all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs I silence),anyway then I asked Dennis that can I atleast meet Mr Marnold said alright then I told him alone that I’m not going away from here next week thrice more(all laugh),said well if you’re so hellbent to get mad get another psychic you’ve got only 3 and only one is pure psychic and no darks and ghosts so atleast try to get another pure psychic or preferably a ghost exactly why I understand you’ve come here first to gauge the situation then only to enter the forest(all laugh),I said I’ll go to the forest only after the arenas(all laugh),said yeah too much bonhomie(all laugh),anyway then I got Haunter and went on saw her first hand,Dennis was the ref(all laugh) and you know just as Mehu was I knew it’s just my sweet big sis in much trouble cause her eyes were telling a different story than what was going on and well Mehu knows this but you know Mehu I’ll tell you today I only realized it to the full after I got Incie my Incineroar the last brat to jump(all laugh)..that is she was trying to analyze the coulours of herself one generating another only to discolour the idea of self so as to colour the being with the idea of discolouring exact which coloures the being to believe that the self is discoloured as the being to be colourfully validated by discolouring the colours of what is seen that just the colourful being itself only cause it can be discoloured only thus hence(all brust into laughter,Mehadi uncontrollbaly laughs and claps)..yeah I first sent that brat there and I always sent them alone to Sabrina unlike to any other cases(all laugh)..and she said you know all were a bit discomforted to have found themselves all alone here but this brat comes in straight jumpes Haunter of all brats(all laugh),says this not male that has coloured itself as so a horrendus foolishness isn’t it that she can only discolour herself but not those who aren’t so turnes to Sabrina isn’t it so Ms Marnold exactly why your sanity has been coloured by you to only when tried to be discoloured by only you the reality it can revoke you rhyming with Mr Oak who for sometimes has been roaming around with a headless brat that he coloured in all honesty so true but who is there only to discolour him as we get it else why changed her name from Ms Waterflower to Mrs Oak a colourful illusion only to discolour herself as her beau who are these humans Ms Marnold who(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,Mehadi in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter)..so Sabrina was on video was laughing like nothing then said this is going on(all laugh),I said yeah alls well that ends well don’t you know(all laugh)..man that brat is just something else in colours(all laugh) and her level is there cause she was the very last and being a fire/dark meant was too fast in picking things up in reverse(all laugh)..Sabrina says in reality Lenny should be literally crucified(all laugh)..and those two dregs of intelligence(all burst..) they should've been debarred from communications(all laugh..lot)..anyway back then Haunter got her to smile after like 3 years and she was cured instantly almost and then later picked up hall of fame tag Haunter remained with her Gengar is her son but she never evolved beyond a Haunter this Gengar I had along with my other ghosts for 5 days at Marengo forest before jumping under the cover(all laugh) without Marill though mind it(all laugh)..anyway,Sabrina got Hall of fame Tag with 15 years when she was 46 me 35 with Chomp in deep reflections at UNOVA!CILIVA!(all laugh)..when I went to Marengo first time in the gym she was 29,me 18 is 11 years older to me but the tag was delayed all cause of her activities she was worthy of it when she was 29/30 and she infact was under probation from 28 to 29 1.5 full years(all laugh)..hasn’t lost a match since she turned 30 and now is 50(all laugh) and thus I’ve met my eternal big sis this term and ever had contacts with her since then ofcourse too much colourful bonhomie(all laugh) and so has Mehu(all laugh) and the rest of my family infact and since that day to now same attitude it’s been 22 years and so on but all I got to know and the rest of the world if surveyed properly there’s no other way to be but to be happy with a Gengar and then a Sableye(all laugh) GENGAR(all laugh,Gengar,Greninja,Mr Mime,Sableye and Chu zaps in and pesters them then again goes away,all laugh)..that is what it is called by psychic channels always at service zapped in here(all laugh) this is the pinnacle of psyhic powers(burst into laughter,others laugh shaking their heads) what is this Gengleye if full of care/we can’t tickle around cause you won’t fare(all laugh)..man if you faced these brats especially Sablie during their stuggle against illusion(all laugh)..anyway,I’m just naming them as they come and Gengar I always consider from Kanto(1)..male..and actually mom Sabrina is to me like Brock or Trace but she has kept a distance from the rest cause she thinks we will disturb her sanity(all laugh) just so naive(all laugh)..
Dialga don’t be a gambler just spin the wheel/when a brat challenges just put up look of that Pewter steel(both laugh a lot,Torrie shakes her head laughing)/when you have come here did you want to come here or did just have that FEEL(both burst into laughter,Torrie shakes her head laughing)/that here’s a gym I’ll get in all you need thus irrespective of your profession is exactly this thus this badge my dear congrats and keep up this very ZEAL but don’t harm yourself while in VIGIL(both burst into laughter,Torrie too laughs)/la la la la la la la la la la la la/Did you notice that la is circling thus how can you get out of it asks the chain of a teetotaler PALKIA(both uncontrollably laugh,Mehadi in tears laughing,Torrie shakes her head laughing)..
yeah mom this was told to Cili who just called before we came down..
Jenny sang to just before the moment of realization la la la la la la la la/Mr Cubin unbound Hoopa pa pa ah ha ha ha(both burst into laughter,Torrie shakes her head laughing) hence it’s all SO NAIVE(all laugh),anyway Sabrina extremely pious since she was born almost actually very similar to Mr Daquan from (),Unova who has been a huge huge cornerstone in my life,Sabrina too is like that thus our frivolity disturbs her daily life exactly why Mr Daquan still hasn’t kept my number(all laugh) Sabrina is ever my sweet big sis I ever have considered her to be so and she the same little bro that I’m to her no matter what and the reason as I said was just the beginning like the reason why Mehu followed me was to get her bike recuperated(all laugh) so this Gengarhood is AH!BEAUTY!BEAUTY!(all laugh) but there’s so much more in Marengo except my family and the forest and areans and all as there’s another someone in Marengo who is an amusing trainer of an Alakazam(burst into laughter,Mehadi frowns at Seth then laughs,Seth quickly hugs her)..I lost my final at Johto to a Melody Sanders from Marengo as you know mom she is this someone that’s so much indespensible to my life as well like all of them(laugh,Mehadi too laughs)..she has been and will be one of the indespensible parts of my life as much as Sabrina is and as much as Gary is and as much as May is all time no matter but that’s later the fun must be first to make the sorrow and being illusion the eventual unfoldment to be the most ENGAGING you see master brat it’s called the art of mental starving(laugh,Mehadi and Torrie laughs shaking their heads),in built counters you see too much bonhomie(laughs a lot,Mehadi smiles at him,Torrie too smiles at him)..anyway,I confessed to Mehu about my feeling to her after Hoenn but it would’ve been done just after the end of Johto had she stayed for another week even if here which was my wish(laugh,Mehadi laughs and shakes her head,Torrie too laughs) in that finals you know I told you many times how without Mehu and Brock I would’ve went out in the 32 round itself not my brats though(all laugh)..I wasn’t in level terms with them during the last 2 months there or so I was rushing they were hushing me vehemently(all laugh) exactly the opposite happened during last two months of Sinnoh(all laugh)..and at Johto why I would’ve lost was cause the opponent Mateo Norris was then a 4 times champion at the age of 32 to my 22 and now in Hall of fame just unlike me(all laugh) I don’t believe I won a single match there certainly against Gary it’s so true(all laugh),finally only Melody could get the better of Solgaleo and no I will keep saying cause it’s true that Solgaleo was my conscious choise I will do the same each time if I get back to the position even from my experiences with them after 16 years and this once more mom and you too Mehu just to tell you what Melody really is in reality if there really is any match for me in profession who can better me on a given day is Melody and not even Sabrina,she can draw a lot and if I want Mehu can’t win either but I can’t want that at all too sweetie my flower(laughs  ehadi quickly,Mehadi blushes,Torrie laughs)..this language is unethical but moral mom and honesty is a great virtue too according to reflections(laughs a lot,Torrie and Mehadi shake their heads laughing)..anyway so Melody has the quality to get her brats spoiled is what I mean in direct language(all laugh),exactly why the bonhomie(all laugh),apart from her infact Mr Oak has ever had this ability(all laugh)..but Mr Oak’s bunch will not take the normal route at all just like his college days(all laugh)..so it’s taking time but given their condition now if they do get spoiled they will be nothing short of my brats cause they infact can lecture on any pokemons themselves as you know being the soulmates of Mr Oak Dr Oak(all laugh),but Gary is Gary I know him from before infact(all laugh) so apart from him Melody has this ability as far as my understanding goes but she isn’t a wicked pro herself like me which is the hindrence(laughs,Mehadi and Torrie laughs)..buffoon-looking-most-hideous-jackal(both laugh,Torrie shakes her head laughing)..no mom you tell me how to address that fox politely cause he’s a fox(both laugh,Torrie too laughs) anyway about my professional matches now against Mr Oak is almost draw cause except for Blastie none listens to him(all laugh) Blastie will take more time any starter do I guess but when they finally get released indeed becomes most enjoying(all laugh) anyway then about Johto and my luck of having my family there with me despite my obscured view that was actually most about Mehu in Johto cause Brock as ever was the Crook but(all laugh) Mehu and me was just so happy being together then and that relected in my performances in a way that I didn’t interfere much in my bunch’s methods(all laugh) but thus also by the end we both were too overprotective of each other and I never let Mehu to talk with anyone unless me or Brock was just beside her(all laugh) and it only deepened cause she was travelling alone with Brock to polish her shoes whole journey(all laugh) and if any girl talked with me for more than 2 minutes and she was present would be extremely angry(laugh,Mehadi and Torrie laughs),and this girl having beaten me 2-1 in total records and her Alakazam topped my 3 brats last two fresh and those were Whimsicott and Solgaleo(all laugh),my Whimsicott was one of most notorious brats of all times as you know(all laugh),was cause now it’s just that maddening tune hence boundless(all laugh) and then Solgy none knew what he wanted or was doing(all laugh) he took time cause of his inherent nature of solving each problems by self mortifying(all laugh),infact Tyrie and Solgy are exactly like me first one doesn’t want to come out of abstraction cause all to him becomes wrong and the later wants to go back to abstraction cause everything here is only that he discerns(all laugh)..so without my flower beside me at Johto and having these two plus having to foster Tyrie and Phampie yeah still same(all laugh) and no he is not better than these two either just as Shiinotic isn’t(all laugh)..anyway I don’t want to say much but it’s so hard each will take a life to finish(all laugh),so as I was saying in honest terms for both me and Mehu to each other only we remain psychophysical despite attempts hence all these only(laughs  ehadi firmly,Mehadi frowns at him,Torrie laughs a lot)..(near Mehadi’s ears audiably)..hum,attitude(laughs a lot  ehadi,Mehadi laughs now shaking her head but Seth doesn’t let her shake her head,she laughs even more,Torrie too laughs),anyway sorry for genderous convolutions(laughs a lot,Mehadi and Torrie shake their heads laughing),so she wasn’t staying with me most times so I went full blast(all laugh) hence also that state quickened and all and so these circumstances also made Mehu very concerned and overprotective and then Melody just as I congratulated her just smiled and straight went into  g me(all laugh) then only finished her words(all laugh) and no I was taken aback a bit but that hug was of my little sister’s by every means I ever remember that and more so I understood after I again met my sweet little May so I knew they were similar but May no matter how insecured she was when I first met her was just her way of growing up I knew was extremely firm and just a great person it was just hidden and she took 20 minutes may be to recognize her big bro and that too cause that was her first region starting day was 16 just and well Aurie,Sintu,Jitters and Ellie are of my age so was like Gary never is not my own flesh and blood so I didn’t get it and Felicia was all over me first sight at 16 both(all laugh) but it was just pure joy nothing more her very character is like that(all laugh) anyway but Melody later told me I felt like I’ve met myself after many years of wait and just was too happy and her nature is like that too extremely straight not for nothing could she tolerate the psychic onslaught on her nerves since 16(all laugh) just opposite to Sabrina in appearance but exactly thus she was a sworn-in enemy to my sweetie sweetie(all laugh) and still is(laugh,hugs Mehadi quickly,Mehadi frowns at Seth then laughs,Torrie frowns and then laughs),but I spoke with her the most(all laugh) afterwards and all time(all laugh) and Mehu never knew of the daily contacts ofcourse only weekly(all laugh) until I confessed to her(all laugh,Mehadi laughs shaking her head) Melody went to the after match party
where Mehu wasn’t allowed cause of rules(all laugh) but before that I did Mehu’s ponytail first time(all laugh) so it was behind the curtains(all laugh) and our discussion was at negative circle that she asked me as we were looking at each other like in dream that pose that,um..Seth,why do boys look at girls(all burst into laughter) and my answer was don’t know a mystry(all laugh) never had the meaningful words cause that disturbed the peace between us in that situation cause you know why out of blue a 20
year old girl so nonchalantly calls you mom after 3 days of physical familiarity and stay(all laugh) and then scoffs at me in front of you taking your side all times(all laugh) but then if you don’t
understand something about training and all tells you how good my victory was but never in front of me and referred to me as Seth(all laugh) and I held her hands without any hesitation or the thought of it in front of you just like Gyarados(hugs Mehadi and laughs,Mehadi and Torrie laughs) and joked with her and whispered to her all time(all laugh) Mehu and me have been wife and husband since before all time hence only(all laugh) so never bothered about words ever but then after this I go to that party and Melody comes up and again hugs me first up(all laugh) I was a bit suspicious now that ok once fine why now again thunder strikes(all laugh)..well I did ask this question to the namesaken brat(all laugh) what he said during Unova without any sleep for 3 days having lost bets against Registeel,Groudon and Melmetal all at a time(all laugh) is a matter of a long chapter so best left now(all laugh) but about Melodious methods(all laugh) what I suspected wasn’t the case I soon understood afterwards there just my age it was infact not her(all laugh) as she then spoke for full one hour with me and her whole experience was foisted upon me exactly like Solgy(all laugh) and had our dinner there and all I realized that what an once ever talent she is in psychic pokemons and yeah I and she both were at the end of our 3rd region only so little did we realize the professional depth that we had and I was a two time champ she three but she herself was so well known on psychic types then and almost all of her bunch was psychic not all pure but had psychics and wanted to talk about them whole life plus next plu and plus(all laugh) 4 months older to me started exactly 4 months before me,finished Kanto as champ 3 months before me,next her now husband Mr John Harrison won,next one Gary Oak flew to the title as Steady Oak(laughs,Mehadi bursts into laughter,Torrie shakes her head laughing),then again Melody went to Pasio,finished 2 months before me,1 month before Gary Oak now known as in-between lines is necessary too Oak(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter,Torrie laughs)..all later Mehu I know each of their tricks(all laugh) anyway John changed profession right after went to psychic specialization his normal brats were left with Melody and I met Melody before too once at Kanto first year lost once at Pasio second year won none could beat my brats unless me there(all laugh) but never met in competitions at Johto but I did meet Mr Marc Litman AGAIN(all laugh) the first time I met Melody was as I said both were 16 so it was just a normal chat and that was 3rd round only she herself lost the next which made me extremely happy(both laugh) but she used to say after that loss her talents really opened up and she never lost another psychic cup EXCEPT again to me at Pasio with MARSHADOW(all laugh) that was semi finals again(both laugh) thus she became extremely unhappy with the winner of the final(all laugh) so then she was hurt in prestige(all laugh) but that made her more concentrated so she won the league(all laugh) this too she used to say that twice before never bothered to talk much(all laugh) it was as I said just sibling rivalry to me nothing else(laughs,Mehadi smiles at him) anyway,but then met at Johto strangely despite starting at same month and in Johto despite doing all those many gyms and competitions never and straight in final and both of us heard about each other since Kanto itself me and she was the surprize package my Muk having Muked a Muk last final(all laugh) and she astonishingly at that age with such a jovial and frank character won 2 in 2 from start with psychic of all types her starter is Eevee then Espeon and then she had very few pokemons but almost all had to be psychic(all laugh) and then ofcourse obviously she was found at all psychic competitons(all laugh) like Oliv psycho(all laugh,Torrie shakes her head laughing)..yeah Mehu I don’t know if you know this one or not,um..no Seth I just don’t know you know,Tony,Oliv has become as much Gyradosy just be careful(all laugh) but don’t waste your time anymore you know her nature and she knows yours(all laugh) so either will bust then it won’t be good for the other why bother thus of the other(all laugh),yeah Seth right..thanks bro thanks if soul is reality why bother..A BATTLE!A VICTORY!THE CONQUERER!..(both burst into laughter,Torrie shakes her head laughing) the other half is,so all along then mental,physical and emotional ages,ages,ages..(both laugh,Torrie shakes her head laughing),Seth just shut up!(all laugh),both you and me know why we are together(all laugh a lot),how in any hell can I..,YOU AND I(all brust into laughter),I said what does that have to do with what you did in psychic channels to your sweet cute beau(all laugh),Seth don’t try to be cunning ok(both laugh a lot,Torrie too laughs shaking her head),you are my bro and I’m your sis did we have to confess our relationship to the other(all brust into laughter),I said listen we’re this because of absense of psychophysicality in absolute and he is that because of the exact opposite to the absolute no matter how true and refined(all laugh) so you should take the normal approaches..(frown)..AWAY FROM THE BUSHES THAT MEMORIZE(laugh,Mehadi bursts into laughter,Torrie shakes her laughing),anyway to this says yeah when it comes to this always on your bro’s side isn’t it Seth cause I don’t have your psychophysical form hum(all laugh a lot),what do you want me to do(all laugh),just tell me about his um..Dedenne(all brust into laughter)..man I can never forget that stuff with the conquerers(all laugh)..RHYNO(both burst into laughter,Torrie shakes her head laughing)..man those two brats are exactly like these two brats you know infact Nanny is worse in a way(all laugh)..Oogly and SISU(both burst into laughter,Torrie too laughs),is that Gyarados washing her dishes by herself these days Seth(both uncontrollbaly laugh,Torrie shakes her head laughing)..man these pests are indeed something(all laugh) then there’s still Junnie and Steller,Culu and Gutu,Biri and Viri and so on(all laugh) anyway,then about Melody that is for professional part and I realized a very sweet girl who is extremely frank to an extent that she was  e a random stranger like as if knows me for ages and was talking about all sorts of psychic stuffs and all I reciprocated to much and you know my approach to girls specially if they ask personal questions(all laugh) professionally(both burst into laughter,Torrie shakes her head laughing) except my wife but if only in ponytails(all laugh)..
YEARS GO BY/ON-THE-FLY(laughs a lot,Mehadi uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Torrie too bursts into laughter)
..and I say these cause you know I feel sad that I didn’t want to understand Melody despite my heart directing to do so so when I’m sad I resort always to..LET US ALL SING HIGH THAT NOTE/DR OAK!OH DR OAK!(both laugh..lot,Torrie shakes her head laughing)..professionally in personal scales(all laugh) anyway,so as usual I spoke all the formalities and all with Melody asked me about Mehu but very politely just asked your travel companion or also girlfriend(all laugh) I said no travel companion for 7 long years since day 1 just one of my best friends very nice girl her attitude is like that always hence you’ve mistaken it in public cause you’ve not seen it privately(all laugh a lot) we are just very good friends(all laugh) this meant I implied that I was well to use the bugged word BOOKED(burst into laughter,Mehadi frowns at Seth,Seth quickly hugs her and then she frowns again,Seth laughs a lot,Torrie laughs) my very first water contest yeah had to be water(all laugh),Massey was the name of that girl still recall cause of the situation(all laugh),first round itself she was my opponent had a bit of talk afterwards wasn’t really that good then and then we go to first break when Bulby saves one of her pokemons from some calamity caused by the great Team Rocket(all laugh) then she goes,’ah!I’ve always liked these kind of brave hearted boys,are you free tonight we need to discuss our future career paths(all laugh)’,’excuse me but he’s BOOKED(burst into laughter,Mehadi shakes her head while laughing,Torrie laughs),’says who(all laugh)?’,’I,MIS-TY(all laugh)’,’oh!MIS-TY are you his girlfriend(all laugh)’,’um..no..I’m his..um..coach(bursts into laughter,Torrie laughs,Mehadi shakes her head laughing)’..sweet bug(quickly hugs Mehadi who laughs,Torrie too laughs)..well that was unofficial but first official water cup was that great one where I for the first time here in this plane and term met Mr Percy Kalos(all laugh) in the final(all laugh)..still says how did that brat Squirtle won against my Palkia(all laugh)..well about Palkia I still remember first time Lenny saw the brat here called me..um..Seth are you sure he’ll behave properly if I go alone(all laugh) no I was brought up at Cirilemon outskirts you know till 5..the folks..(all laugh)..now says man no wonder these brats are in folks rather shouldn’t have come out(all laugh)..anyway to answer Percy Kalos’ imploring I said I’m sending the ball now(all laugh)..no let it go Seth still my brat can’t forget that in 23 years may be 10 meetings in-between(all laugh)..and yeah his beau is Manthie still so yeah definite precaution(both burst..,Torrie shakes..)..and bro-in-law is Redzie(all laugh..lot)..man what a family that is Mr Humberto still is as muc
