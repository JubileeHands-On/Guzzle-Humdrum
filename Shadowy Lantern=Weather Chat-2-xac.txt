    "body": "Poppy(laughing..) : \"so Mehu screeched my ears off saying DaisyDevil has been caught finally trying to understand the properties not presentation of a formulating never answering jackal(all un..long,..The Fitted Ones,all un..,Tracey and Daisy too un..long)..so i looking at the region told this to(laughing..) The Brawn Glenol(all un..),says,\njackal looking for various reasons to intrude your territory/day and night be vigilant of this phenomenon own not the jackal cause this is the fox of the trap of anxiety in countering in fox of arsenal as accessory(all un..long time,Tracey and Daisy un..)..then ofcourse myüïØÔ∏è told me one of the distinguished properties will be if you look at something for a certain span of time he will notify it to you not your attention saying what you were looking at never what it was(all un..long time,Guang..the Tracey of subtler,all un..long time,Tracey too un..)..i asked but that's just what Doctor Slate always did when we were together alone never when traveling(all un..long,Guang..THAT FEELING,all un..long,Brock too un..),says no that's just the intellect of things as such this is another spin up like the characteristics of emotions this is the information contained in such(all un..long time,Guang..The ü¶ä of attributes,all un..long,Tracey too un..)..so i said ok i'll ask Mehu who said,i was wiping my hair after bath and something in the water caught my attention so i kinda was wiping automatically as if absent minded to it but then i understood what it was and picked up the pace of wiping then finished and went for dinner now Dr Jackal returns from shower as well was at the same lake just as i sit for dinner says yeah Mehadi you weren't wiping your hair at a consistent pace before finishing as you finished it too quickly was it an Omastar or Squid(all un..long time)..so Mehu said i didn't understand one bit of the logic behind this question except that he thought something caught my attention so i thought he must be telling me to be more attentive so i said um..no it was sudden says,no no that is observable from your action as i said else you'd remain detached from the pace of your action but you must've wiped your hairs  tslowly thus finished quicker in the end so you suddenly found yourself absent from past to present thus when you recalled it you wanted to shorten the future but that's also only so cause the past reminder of something you had to do in future that is to come here for dinner hence the present then that caught your attention,rather than a reminder if detached from the essence of the subject as a thing that caught your attention,can be observed to be intrinsic to the thing as well hence according to law of conservation of self and attention your self was left alone converting in attention rather thus even when it converted back to your self it would've been,if detached as a reference,mean that the being was just annotated as present or absent to self hence you could observe that you were in haste as you only were deciding if your process of annotation too was absent but then you returned to normal self as you understanding this conservation of self and attention classified the individual being as a continuation rather than recurring procedure of qualia the reference of the holistic being in dynamism(all un..long)..so thus i only told you to tell you this process that i came across so the two named entities i used just for the formulation of the dynamic,among intellect changing,pointer called qualia to holistic being as a static address to depose logic rather than construction of concentration on it's consequences (all un..long),so Mehu said i looked around to clarify if others were in my qualia or just present as representative of my current confusion(all burst..,Dr Jackal),so i later asked that Crook who was at ease finally with his feelings not only what they were(all un..long) hence was leading with rigour than vigour THAT FEELING(all un..long),so i asked him what is the difference between Rory Kencil and Sera Tondil and the FoxingDevil of properties(al un..,..The Fitted Ones,all un..,Tracey and Daisy un..),so now Dashing Crook feels the leading of excitement not explanation in my question on confusion(all un..long),hence says,\nlease of achievement look forward requires the vote of desire/alone in appreciation of self my dear sis look looses it's intelligbility to further inquire(all un..long)..in general the feeling to enquire is deducted from the feeling of previous feeling in consequence Poppy thus the feeling that feels the deduction asks the feeling of desire which if not there it has to feel not to further inquire thus the differnece between the two sets mentioned my little sis is only in the feeling of being adaptive to self not in the inquiry of how to know how or what is what rather how to adapt the desire in itself as being, as that's the very entailment of essence of self of desire(all un..long,Lillie..we demand you acknowledge our following suggestions and then only can we further feel to inquire jointly as neutrals into any further on anything or the raised issues too if needed is any action,all un..long,Lillie..yours truly in the mutually feeling of observance,all un..long,Lillie..these properties were found to be the troubles thus we suggest from the handlers the situational presence-at causal experience of emotions rather than it's practiced control,all un..long time,Lillie..as we know control can't be done unless it's felt to be needed from an unattached authority upon the sequences as consequences in patterns or chaos they enroll,all un..long,Lillie..thanks looking forward to be introduced on your feelings on these issues on being asked by next,all un..long,Lillie..till then best wishes on the causal time on anything also except for our mutual pondering on our feelings spent,all un..long,Lillie..thanks IN regards,all un..long,Cedar and Gladys..The Provided Ones,all un..long,Tracey and Daisy,Brock and Violet un..)..so then i told my brats to ask him like,\nOh Mr Skechit tell why being is only a problem bonafide/if only i to be on me as you ascribe(all un..)/thus Mr Skechit if this a dining room/tell us the correlation between space and for privacy of it's fragments which on which as YOU loom(all un..long)/Oh Mr Skechit if thus you have a consistently continuous time/tell us why are you now again going through it's very discrete dimes(all un..long time)/Mr Skechit hence you tell us now/how to be detached from a match of why and look again a circular how(all un..long,Tracey..The better Foxing of Prognosis,all un..,Cuong and Poppy un..)..\"\nCedar(laughing..) : \"well actually we were at complete bay then with the translation project so now Muntie tells me how can i do anything unless i know how do does it translate this from 'i can see too' take that you namecall(all un..)..so i thought how the hell can you map this with integrity of information contained within fiction makes it a Diction Looking Only at it's unsound cessation(all un..long)..so now i forced this down Gladie's throat who said,um..but that's not a trouble at all now it's just viscosity of tension(all un..),i said what are you smoking these days Hands-On proof this(all burst..),this also is a proof too Logic-only-on-Demand how about this hum(all un..),i said please i can't work in public domain like this(all burst..),so says just tell them thus,quote record(all laugh..lot)\"\n..(Recording,Cedar and Gladys talking,Gladys from her Ransei Journey)..\nGladys(excited) : \"what's that..jackal jackal says it's just the inversion of might(all un..long)/but then that too is questioned..jackal thus says look out for the attachments of inspite(all un..long)/jackal says thus look at this Pokemon/what this being tells you is only remaining HUMAN(all un..long)..\"\n..(Recording ends)..\nCedar(laughing) : \"so i told Lenny to find a pattern between,jackal jackal look is üèÉ through/but the feets don't observe what it's hoing to be but what it's only now attached to(all un..long),so he after a few days gave me some reports if mapped means,\noh look jackal searches for onl roadside sign(all un..long)/as that's the ü¶ä of determining observation on attachment to or not to fine(all un..long)/jackal jackal look now consoles you/but observing through synonyms only your interface's algorithmic bind to you(all un..long)..then i was asked to tell people how my solution works so i said,oh jackal jackal looks only to the bugs that's beside(all un..)/as that's the corner point for attaching insight (all un..long)/look the ü¶ä of fixation now searching for solution(all un..long)/through observation of consideration rather than what it will shun(all un..long)..then i was berated as i couldn't come up with any actual solutions i said none ever has where are you living this long expect being a managent bully of water to ice to vapour and back in characterizations of any as a thing(all un..,..DaisyDevil),anyway then to understand this they inquired how the jackal has survived normalcy for so long Doctor Slate revolted against traditional pace and integrity of holistic human progress from 0-17(all laugh..lot) he finished 0-17*infinite inlike 17 seconds from birth when the eyes popped up open all said we should've been scared but we felt it hence smiled with him after a minute(all un..long,..Leading Crook,Brock too un..)..then even his own flower  wasn't at all stable which Viol flower resembled too but as did her feelings hence there's conformity here there's no conformity rather opposition though we realized DaisyDevil didn't need characterizations at all apart from observation exactly which very obsession has trapped her that she refuses to admit it thus search it hence this method of cessation else search has the improper character of thus(all un..,..DaisyDevil)..man Luhum still says i first was forced to live separate from my my hubby second my host was DaisyDevil who was 5.5 in middle of the idea of school which she viciously jumped upon as heuristic despite being advertised as analytic(all un..,..DaisyDevil)..but the Jackal remained in traditions perfectly Hector says no never any discrepancies except he was too attentive at absolutely everything yet too uninterested in anything barring philosophy and pokemons the two dissected us thoroughly cause to us they had no semblance What-so-Ever(all laugh..lot)..Doctor Slate we all understood is naturally talented being born in a gym and those two traders of lexicon we knew were only after copyrights the most impossible instantly we thought what did we just say it's countering(all un..long,.. Outlaws of Lexicon,all un..long)..still first time i asked Gladie who came with you this time the answer is just imagine this on engagement ceremony,who has come with you,oh you mean Who-oh-Ringtone (all un..long,All the Waterflower Sisters..Dice Simulate,all un..long)..then i went on to meet the menace after this description(all un..)..who at first meeting says,are you Cedar or Ortiz compeer are you just or are you just or did i forced me to burst..the most corresponding isn't it answer answer answer(all un..long,..Dice Simulate,all un..long)..so i asked what does it mean says with such wonder the Dice of meaning on the chance of perception's simulation the most diverging infinite such trivial so composite why would you ask compeer to be just to be countering why how else can i be of you(all un..long,..Who-oh-Ringtone,all un..long)..anyway(all laugh..lot),then next i met it's never any gender could assert Dice Simulate(all un..)..so the compeer-of-arms comes,um..hallow sis,Perceptive!(all un..long)..the conservation of actual and essential(all un..long,..We-ah-Forlorn,all un..long)..aww..Hui our bro-of-expression(all un..long) is so much talented in technicals of greetings(all un..long)..hey bro how did you learn one from so many tell me tell us no not them(all un..long,..We-ah-Forlorn,all un..),so i said um..but you're a being(all un..long),with as much wonder says,the conceptual king compeer as self such a thing why how else to be my compeer oh i so shy..the most demanding(all un..long,..Bias Populate,all un..long),so then i somehow said what's required for effacement of psychophysicality,necessity compeer is what i found never amongst want the bias or availability the population of own validity (all un..long)..thus why do you ask me compeer how can you ask me or can i answer to my(all un..long,Violet..We from the biased association want these two dregs of society be removed from extra rights concerned,all un..long,Oh you mean Dice of objectivity in subjective concerns if done through simulation of decisions,all un..long,thus Bias and Populate compeers why what's the solutional as in resolutional or solutional as in the mixture's concern,all un..long,Violet..Derelicts of Exceptions,all un..long,Daisy..Oh Living Hunter/Look consciousness's Coffin Saunter/Thus Able satiation's self enabling sections/else another in reflection to self is Lastly Phantom,all un..long)..so(all laugh..lot),these two still validated our engagement as witness not signers why that's what the lexicon says as meaning they can't breach it later as part of Morality else look Refilled Concern of honesty(all un..long)..so then the registers themselves signed as on behalf of observations i finally realized all those attempts of technology so futile for definite solution when complete virtualization does the trick by virtue of being through all that just this..existence..Hands-On(all un..long,..Civilization,all un..long)..man what sort of ideas they came up with(all laugh..lot)..anyway then as Hector was saying baby jackal was too attentive and baby devil too efficient in categorizing things(all laugh..lot,..The Assembled Ones,Tracey and Daisy un..)..but he was as usual very normal outside then went off from university a few who were in same class says at hostel we always pestered him but didn't say anything one day may be it was too much said do you want me or my compeers thus which is right hallow or hi(all un..long)..then we realized this brat isn't at all normal cause this fitted with his characters so rumours spread that this is the very jackal when Gyre Cauldron reached him he said he had no idea what they were asking him then said they disturbed his studies and all then using Gyre got out of the university later after 12 years Gyre said see what sort of a cunning fox this is first used his hostel mates to shiled himself from us then us tho shield himself from them and his own parents and relatives and all which conning all of us as we understood exactly what he said his but not him said no songs were enough not for nothing to describe this sort of a jackal of situations(all un..long,Gladys..oh drar being..don't try me with your recognition/look at profession I'm your.. ü¶ä of penetration,all un..long,Gus..Tracey-looking-most-cunning-fox,all un..long,Tracey too un..long)..then finally we said look at the very name so maddening this tune(all burst..,Tracey shakes..)..then anyway they asked the jackal this question how he survived all so normally something the very Convene Skats and their intellectual flowers most abjectly failed to(all laugh..lot) they were told with much wonder that if they wanted to know something why would they ask for an answer on the thing not the validation that they know it alone or is corroborated also then proceed in this line why would they attach themselves with want rather than the thing in reference(all un..long,Gladys..I'm the jackal of senses/the fox of essences/thus i'm the unambiguous jackal of ambiguous meaning of self of noun or noun of self of- attendance,all un..long,Zee..Oh accusers..don't ask for my presentation/as look i'm the jackal of concentration,all un..long,.. Tracey-looking-most-wicked-jackal,all un..long,Tracey too un..)..\"\nViolet(fits..) : \"well Doctor Slate was very annoyed Dase most incensed with everything but the jackal insisted that the accusers should be allowed to validate their reasons as part of reflective honesty(all un..long)..so then and their DaisyDevil jumped him over characteristic morality of eho that he know he'll win(all un..long,..The Conformed Ones,all un..long,Tracey and Daisy too un..)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"Zara said they couldn't understand what they were doing at all by accusing them cause it was just them in encirculation then all said indeed like look at my profession..I'm the..ü¶ä of citation(all un..long)\"",

concerned) : \"no Mehu,as stubborn as you if not more,would never still come back and say he was sorry if he doesn't believe he's done any mistake and would torture himself to death trying to prove to himself that he was morally right and that is all to him let the relationship go if they don't understand me\"\nLillie(concerned) : \"exactly like you Mehu,and as you said and even now so desperate to heal any kind of pain that he only now glaringly feels he's put you through unknowingly,now desperately wants to go through you pains again and again to justify himself,really i mean you two truely as he said..\"\nMehadi(blush,giggle) : \"Soulmates\"(Daisy&Lillie laughs)\nMehadi : \"um,you know when he met me yesterday and himself was describing what he did to you and all else i could just see how much pain he's constantly self inflicting,he real nature is ever the sweet little Ash,but as we broke up and he felt that that nature is exactly what his Mehadi didn't believe him due to things happening around him and left,so he'll just try desperately to prove to himself and all else that,that nature isn't his own at all,and it had gone to a obsession where he'd tear apart anything just to see that whether despite all he did he found his Mehadi again who really still realized what he was trying to do and would run back to him again and again no matter what kind of demon he became.. that's exactly the hells he was talking about..\"\nLillie (concerned) : \"My god! what a guy..would self mortify himself to any unimaginable hell to find his soulmate again..\"\nDaisy : \"yeah,just opposite to Mehu as she was going everywhere only to thrash them apart mercilessly as soon as his Ash showed up in them again and finally was left with nothing getting depressed till that very Ash showed up again,and this you know Mehu,when he was piercing us through and through yesterday he said exactly this as an insult,as soon as he lays his first touch,you're running arter him without any consideration whatsoever\"\nMehadi(solemn) : \"truely Dase,only he could understand my problem and could do what he did..um..i don't know Dase,may be i was still way better than his own condition,what he's doing around now is the actual playfullness that his soul and what he's all about and you can see how irresistibly enticing and attractive it is now that he's just laughing off anything he ever did while self mortifying in a way that it just floods everyone away with him to playfullness,but what he had been doing everywhere before,i just got every bit of it yesterday,and you know all those hells he talked about,not only he himself went through all and wanted more and more so did he subject me to go through with him till he himself confessed that he can't beat me and can't shrug me off\"\nLillie(concerned,hugging Mehu) : \"Mehu,i was really scared you know as well as feeling that abject pain myself,i was really afraid that infact he threatened us that even if Mehu becomes insane after this,he can't be leagally harmed and all that,and we could sense what kind of monster he really had become and was only going to come at you with absolute all out to settle something that was disturbing him for a long time but you know as just 12 hours later he laughed all that off,i'm realizing monster or master(Mehadi smiles) he's an extremely honest guy even yesterday did only said point by point why he was hurting us citing what we might've ever done to him or to his mom and all that...and none were wrong at all\"\nDaisy(concerned) : \"indeed Mehu,now you're telling us we can see why actually his fooling around and making all us laugh everything off as well,this guy is obsessive in his conviction that whatever his soul is directing him to do,is true and right all the time and its just that thing now in the form of laughter overflooding us as merrily as the hellfire did burn us mercilessly yesterday\"\nMehadi : \"you know,yesterday i cried like i never knew as he was dragging me  through every hell he could come up with and much more than he depicted today and i seriously felt i won't be able to take it anymore,and in fact twice he calmed me down by the help of his Pokemons (Daisy&Lillie shivering hugs Mehadi)..(smile).. it's ok,he would've gone with me as well no matter where it took him to and you can see that he had the faith and it was only me who wanted to walk with him..he took me to unimaginable depths of hell and all the while was carefully observing me whether i budge or not,if he felt i really did budge he would've instantly left me and himself became insane as he would've realized even his Mehadi won't walk with him everywhere,he would've become exactly like what a pokemon is his in human body,a total lunatic who only wanted to fool around...and even after i was coming back again and again thrashing all the fake copies he was creating to throw me off..i really thought whether we'll end ever or not given our own stubbornness and just only then did i realize that he has become an absolute lunatic in his obsession to go hell after till he destroyed every ounce of sanity he ever had and it just didn't feel to me like we could be stopped or wanted to be stopped because i too had become mad in thrashing all his hells and run after him to finally get together it just didn't feel i wanted to stop either as he himself didn't want to,later only realized what i felt then was what he was describing as come for me again and again beyond death..i realized his actual call and obsession with himself to go beyond every death and still continue to run never stopping and sanity or insanity is a mere term there where he went(tears,Daisy and Lillie too has tears in their eyes) he wasn't Ash Ketchum at all anymore and didn't care whether i was alive at all or he himself,his being had crossed all limits and he forgot himself forgot me forgot everything just continuing his run as playfully as he is roaming around now to where he didn't know, didn't want to know but these too are only words to him,he had become the very soul that we read and that cant be described and was at a breakneck speed just playfully with crackling laughter thay all his agony had now become moving somewhere that none can describe...this is poetic and we read only but as you see your crying yourself (tears rolling down everyone's cheeks) and then i found out that i too am always travelling along with that playful march of his soul forgetting any identity i ever knew-i didn't know whether i was alive or dead or whatever i myself wasn't Mehadi Waterflower anymore as he was no more Ash Ketchum,i too had become the soul thay he had become and was equally playfully going just side by side as if playing hide and seek with each other and my pain and tears had also become crackling laughter just like his,i just then felt eternally always with him constantly just the same thing appearing as two different entities to us(all cries,Mehadi in shivering voice)but now about to merge together but actually we didn't want to megre we wanted to keep that separation keep that distance between each other just to play that hide and seek eternally like mere kids knowing nothing else,he was me,i was him,we had no difference at all and we were only as if mischeviously keeping that distance only to fool around together always together and nothing there was possible to describe our relationship or anything,we had become the one and absolute only fooling ourselves with this appearing difference that we were projexting to enjoy ourself..in fact then i realized there was never any Ash Ketchum or anything else at all it was just me myself and Ash Ketchum was a thing i myself had created to fool around with myself and exactly to show me that was there ever any Ash Ketchum at all and Ash Ketchum had just shown me that...after this trace kinda state i came back to my senses when i suddenly heard him saying 'Mehadi, you must marry someone else and have a good family forget a f.. like me whoose hellbent of self destructing himself just because he can' that word and idea of anything apart from Ash Ketchum just pierced me so through and through and then his self destruction which he just had showed me to my own realization that Ash Ketchum is nothing but Mehadi Waterflower,i just couldn't take it anymore and screamed at him that it's either him or bust for me he just laughed at my face and that showed his own realization that he went through just like me so many times that he just knew even now he could play around with me all he want and said the words that you won't be able to imagi..he said 'if i f\n.. around any random s.. would i still be f.. you around?' ..you can understand what he just threw with what kind of audacity and vulgarity at me as if this world with anything what so ever had no value whatsoever at all and he was ever the carefree soul knowing he was totally immune to anything that this world can ever imagine to throw at him and this was the whole point he wanted to show me for all these 17 years i guess which he finally could with complete mastery and utmost audacity which will throw anybody off except his soulmate all while fully knowing exactly that,and now was just as if knew my answer and just fooling around with me as he knew himself his Mehadi was not what was appearing before him but has ever been and being and will be his very own self-he himself-so he now decides to swear around left and right with unimaginable nonchalancy with me as if my appearance to him meant absolutely nothing as he already knew and had the true Mehadi Waterflower ever always with him and will be...and these words along with my realization made me understand that he was still laughing at me with the the perfect knowledge that his real Mehadi will eventually in just a matter of moments pierce through the appearing Mehadi and no matter what he did to the appearance and Dase,when he said-i'll kill you and enjoy your slow death and see if you want to die like that again and again for me or rather get a moments chance to be with me if the former assured an uncertain but definite permanent union-he meant every word of it as he himself had long surpassed any limitations whatsoever so even if he was in this world nothing really mattered to him at all...and at this moment i just said yes he could never be not but only ever be with me as he knows it himself that i was only he himself(all crying)..this finally appeased the devil and then with that same nonchalancy and playfullness he proceeded formally to define by word what he  exactly showed me first hand that the nothing could describe our bond in between most appropriately except saying that we're soulmates and now this again would make us laugh out even in this state(tears,but smiling,Daisy and Lillie stopped crying and looking at Mehadi now),he finished it with probably the greatest audacity you can imagine while at that juncture as if all was just as he showed a mere appearence and self illusion with you admitted soulmate and even that that's the word he laughed off as he knew he had just shown what he meant so his appearance and behaviour or words never matter thus he said that(mild laugh,with tears,Daisy and Lillie closely looking at Mehadi not crying a bit flustered,with faint smiles)Ash and Mehadi are soulmates and this fact no vulture,be it of Cerulian or(all laugh with tears) any other godforsaken breed(now all laughing with less tears)can ever do anything about no matter what they insinuated(all laugh with tears of joy now) and then finally admitted to reconcile with me,only after the declaration that even in his biggest all-or-none juncture,all his steps and actions has thus been rigourously proved so that(all laugh)no Cerulian Brats and Vultures (all laugh out loud) no matter what they insinuated to (all laugh again) could ever prove the fact that Ash Ketchum wasn't honest with himself(all laughs with tears) Lil,Dase,first to me and now to us all,just as jovially he made us cry to death has he made us laugh to immortality,Ash Ketchum masterfully has shown that no matter what the Cerulian Vultures has ever insinuated to in their damn books(all laugh again),Ash Ketchum by totally self destructing himself has rather directly shown anyone what soulmate really means\"(everybody brusts into tears of joy and laughter and engage in group hug,claps)\n(few moments later)\nMehadi(tears) : \"and you know Dase,Lil when i was giggling to him after this realization,Ash was even then still fooling around and his words were 'why stupid b.. why are you laughing after going through all hells completely losing every bit of your chastity..soulmate,what a f.. word..stupid b..',can you imagine these words even in that state nonchalantly telling a girl he's about to get married that she is a stupid b.. and doesn't have any chastity?..(tears,smile)\"\nLillie(shaking,sobbing) : \"Mehu,to anybody he can just call the most chaste woman a b.. and the viseversa and would still be equally adored by them,he had just gone beyond any limitations one can imagine...he has firmly proved that the Vultures (all laugh) just can't even touch him\"\nDaisy(sobbing and laughs) : \"Mehu,I only wish this could be written down or recorded but then \nagain Ash Ketchum then would've insinuated (all laugh) just like what his immortal enemies (all laugh) the Cerulian Vultures has done...(all laugh)\nLillie(tears,joy) : \"and even now we being from Cerulian itself,has he made us curse our own birthplace has as nonchalantly as he could swear at his soulmate telling her she has no chastity,even during reconciliation,to a woman he laughs 'your unchaste' just before proposal and she's loving every bit of it...(claps)..(all laugh and smile and giggle)..Mehu,you've known me and Dase how nonchalant we were in our younger days and saw many,but this is only very few can ever do just sitting on the verge of complete destruction only to laugh at the fact that he would still come back no matter what...(tears)..\"\nMehadi(tears) : \"to again and again prove that no vulture would ever catch him or anyone else who dared to follow him\"(all tears and joy,clapping)\nMehadi,Daisy&Lillie(Unison, hugging each other) : \"Soulmate!\"\n(few moments later)\nMehadi(laugh) : \"Trace hasn't still returned i guess he's being again dragged through hells\"(all brusts into laughter)\nDaisy(laughing) : No probably at the Lab,might be checking all the pokemons(laugh) or just fooling around as well..(all laugh)\nLillie(smile) : \"and that little brat yesterday insulted me with the same nonchalancy as when he came back to patch up that no matter what one day we'd still realize that Vultures could never tame him(all laughs)\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"and before leaving would play a nasty prank with someone who is most incensed with him and just hours later all 3/4 years difference would wipe out with a lecture ad around last hours of a night...really,Mehu you need to be gazing him all time(all brusts into laughter)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"Which he himself told his mom to allow him to(all laugh)or else he'll snatch away Mr Mime and battle him(laugh,others smile),said 'we have a deal here' as nonchalantly as you can imagine(all brusts into laughter) and even to his own mom he as audaciously as you can't imagine said 'you have an idea about me and especially your daughter'(laugh,Daisy and Lillie wonders)\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"my god! what level of confidence that nothing really matters\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"if mom and dad were here,he would probably just as nonchalantly go and straight ask them 'can i runaway with Mehadi to nowhere?(all brusts) and somehow would've managed to do exactly that(all brusts into laughter)\"\nDaisy(laughing) : \"i just can't believe that now we just don't have any barriers what-so-ever between any of us and can just about as well play around to our extent and all the troubls that may come would be thrown at any vulture(all laughs) to try and meticulously get figured out while we enjoy ourselves(all again laughs)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"and you know he didn't even want to come here to apologize yesterday the first place saying he doesn't need to,i send him Forcefully,went out saying he'll be late as he has to go revisit his farm plans and would be pretty late,went to his beloved Cerulian(all laughes) gets mobbed..and what a way to describe that as well(laughs)\nDaisy&Lillie(unison) : \"go on,your beau in a half day has created a mayhem that'll take an eternity to digest and he's only getting started\"(all laughs)\nMehadi(laughs) : \"you know what they're thinking about him,and he went to Cerulian on Ganger having only Gerninja as the cover..(Daisy and Lillie laughs)..i told him to be bit cautious but now as you see he just doesn't care at all and yes i'll force him to be next time but the antics he did there..(laugh).. according to him, Cerulian Mob thinks 1.he was the one to first reject the youngest flower forcing her into severe depression\n2.then he came back to humiliate her,which when fuelled with the previous is pretty dangerous\nthen even more dangerously\n3.he broke into her room trying to kidnap her and try to reconcile which was thwarted by the flower who due to security reasons had left for to Elite4 headquarters (all brusts laughter)\nthus he proudly showed how he was the one cause due to which the Cerulian City has lost it's last flower as well(all brusts into laughter) forcing the famous gym to be shut down,all flowers having left the city and finally the Sensational Sisters also having been abruptly closed so people are incensed and he was now their central focus(all faint laugh)\"\nDaisy(feint smile) : \"Mehu,this is too dangerous you know,having only two pokemons no matter how strong they were and flying on Ganger..\"\nLillie : \"yeah don't let him next time.. anyhow say\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"he said he actually played a card to mitigate the anger there by resigning from Hall of Fame,so the Cerulian brats(all smile) now think finally this new pest to public peace(all brusts into laughter) is depressed as our flower has finally trodden over his chest(all laugh) rejecting him(Mehadi shows the ring and all brusts into laughter)..so,this new meance now having been totally distraught has lost his mojo and went into depression and thus resigned (all laugh) so he goes to the police station asks for protection by threatening them that unless he got protection quickly (laugh) he'd shoplift(all brusts into laughter) at this specific address(all brusts into laughter again)\nLillie(laugh) : \"Mehu,this is just insane..(all again laughs)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"so now he goes to Mr Keller and he describes his appearance to the Cerulian Mob as(all laugh)\n'but then appolocalype approachs(all brusts into laughter),\nsuddenly that brat appears off the blue/in all smiles with his sinister crew(all brusts into laughter)/to get to a shop as if to get his due(all laugh)/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(all uncontrollably laughs)\"\nDaisy(laughing) : \"Ash Ketchum really has become a new pest to personal space as well...(all brusts into laughter)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"then according to him the Cerulians say->\n'what a night this comrades Cerulian/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon(all laugh)/so comrades lets come and challenge to this man/force him show what he hides below his tan'(all brusts into laughter)\nLillie(laughs) : \"and he only had Gerninja as fresh\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"they mob him and accuse him of abducting the youngest flower and insinuate (all brusts into laughter) that the Gym,the Sisters and the Show all gone due to him,infact not one but he has abducted all the four flowers(all brusts into laughter) to which he challenges them 50 on 1 with Gerninja all at a time\"\nDaisy&Lillie(awestruck) : \"my god!what if..\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"his logic is that the more pokemon the more illusion over his ability\"\nDaisy(concerned) : \"really Mehu,you have to lease him well(all laughs)..this is too much\"\nMehadi(laughs) : \"yeah,i'll but just look at his nonchalancy just hours after going through all hells to get his soulmate and then all of your stares and all..just laughs at everything and then as the number confused them and he said Gerninja isn't found naturally in Kanto so more confusion,is the meantime he placed the order(all brusts into laughter)\nLillie(laughing) : \"this is just classic\"(all laugh)\nMehadi (laughing) : \"then he retorts them why were they so angry and then appeases them by saying Cerulian has best diamonds in the world so where would he go, buying himself the time to deal in the shop(all laughs again),then the mob retorts all their accusations,tonwhich and now(laugh) please help..he says what do you people want the Sisters or the Performance show(all brusts into laughter)\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"this was said to a ferocious mob just about to jump on him with one pokemon and limited police in that short space...and this time that he bought,he proceeded with the shopping..(all brusts into laughter)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"this according to him made the mob absolutely confused then he showed them some Gerninja balance tricks all tricks and finally dispersed them completely by saying if they mob him and hold him up,his fiancee wont appreciate the Cerulian people(shows the ring and all brusts into laughter) as much as their diamonds(all brusts into laughter)\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"then he came here to apologize (all laughs even more)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"and he assured them that he had nothing to do with the gym leader he just thought he could help and so on and said she'll back probably holidaying somewhere brunt out overworking and so on(shows her ring again,all laugh) and before leaving gave them the ultimate advise that no matter how electrifying darling of masses may the sisters has been(all laugh) they have to also settle down and have a nice family(all laugh) and whether their own beloved fans won't spare them even for this bit(all laughs) which is his sentiment card that totally decimated the mob and he came he with flying colours(all brusts into laughter\"\nDaisy(laughing) : \"this just keeps getting better and better (all laugh) he even managed to give an insurmountable defense for us as well..Mehu,long live Pokemon Master\"(all brusts into laughter)\nMehadi(laughing) : \"then he brutally slaughtered all of you(laughs)\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"know evem that would do go on..\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"we can't mind anymore at all\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"he said first Daisy doesn't allow him to enter(Daisy laughs),then calls him b.. all the time(all laugh),then when he finally calms her down with how he only tried to judge her baby sister only etc she finally budges and in the meantime Trace comes out to gauge(all laugh) the situation but eats a death glare from Daisy(all laugh) and doesn't come into any help to him as usual as he has always pestered him whenever he got his flower alone(all brusts into laughter) since Orange Islands(all laughs even more),then Daisy gives him merching order telling him to at that time of night don't use her as a shiled to protect himself from infidelity that too on his first night(all smiles,Daisy shakes her head) as if unless she told he would've exactly done that(all laugh) which made Daisy to return basking in her glorious victory (all brusts into laughter) while dragging poor Tracy with her as she thought is influence has already corrupted her husband(all brusts into laughter) by every means(all laugh)\nDaisy(laugh) : \"he has even made me laugh with this as well\"\nMehadi(bit concerned) :\"but um..\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"go on my child has got enough recreation for the entire life

laugh) only to be sent to the lionesses (Lillie laughs hard) who was the biggest threat(all laugh) to his eventual marriage (all brusts into laughter)..then he says that the lionesses directly junps to prey upon him by again calling him names and whatnot while he says that at this time she should take rest which the lionesses brushes aside by accusing he'll cheat on her baby Mehu that night itself(all laughs) oh and by the way Daisy also told him that he threatened her baby Mehu to reconciliation(all laughs) now the lionesses continues to her victory march depicting how much he has fallen pauses to bite him saying he'll definitely leave her sister and finally goes to the end by stating he has no chance of reconcilation with anyone to which he all the while says that she must take care of herself and then finally dragging Gary's name in he tames the lionesses (Lillie brusts into laughter)(all laugh) but still she paws him by giving the marching orders while reminding him of the root to his just wed wife as if otherwise he would've lost the way(all laughs uncontrollably),then as he comes out,the lion jumps upon him to politely bark him(all brusts into laughter) to his grandpa,who was waiting patiently for his turn which was unfortunately he on the day(all brusts into laughter)\"\nLillie(laughing) : \"this no comedy can ever give you,Ketchum has really caught us all(all brusts into laughter)\nMehadi(laughing) : \"he says he had to be extra careful to lick the boots of the old bear(all laughs) so that he doesn't have to transfer all his pokemons that night itself playing the childhood-home and humility-despite-fame card that rather appeases the professor but he beaks his head off questioning about his pokemons and whatnot (all brusts into laughter) which on the backdrop of his Cerulian adventure is the most boring anticlimax (all brusts into laughter) anyway he somehow manages to get out only to be absolutely incensed to realize that that very momnet,the gentleman-looking-most-cunning fox named Trace(all uncontrollably laughs) is dreaming in the Orange of Oranges with his flower(Daisy laugs out loud) while he was toiling hard to even get to his own flower this realization angers him extremely (all laugh) so he tells ganger to fetch the brat immediately (all laughs uncontrollably) which he tickllly obliges(all brusts into laughter) as the sweet sweet fox(all brusts into laughter) comes out he doesn't know which side to sail to(all laughs) only managing to fire out the why drag all in bullet which by then he repeated so many times that he got angrier(all laughs) and fired in the canonball that all he wanted to do was to check the chemistry before parade(all laugh,Daisy shakes her head) which this fox wickedly shields (all laughs) by saying that they'll not be his flower but follow suit always which stuns him so much that he resorts to the embrace-it-out option(all laugh) meanwhile Daisy again comes out with fhe groundbreaking declaration that she had evsdropped them(Daisy brusts into laughter,others follow suit) which as if was unknown to him(all brusts into laughter) and declares that why he was back whether he had spoken to yer younger lionesses (all brusts into laughter) etc to which he continues the sentiment card which Daisy doesn't think she can handle for long(all brusts into laughter) thus tries to pull off his own trick on him(all laughs) by selling him the same wisdom nut he had earlier sold her(all brusts into laughter) saying that alright she admitted her baby Mehu went to him intentionally and would roam around him all her want for the rest of her life(Mehadi laughs,others smile)but she shouldn't suffer for her devotion (all smile) which he rather ducks out(all laughs) but is again incensed again seeing her crooked man(all laughs) was enjoying his death all the while smirking and thinking of the final attack that'll absolutely nail him down(all brusts into laughter),so to foild Daisy again from dragging him inside(Daisy laughs) he uses him to insinuate (all brusts into laughter) that his actions endangered his pokemons which this wicked fox jokes out(all laugh) and makes a comeback by advising him to phone around all from Brock to God(all laughs uncontrollably) which he then somehow bypasses only to be so incensed as this constant hindrence having pestered him for 15 hears whenever he wanted to adore his flower in complete seclusion(all laughs) and even today was upto his old tricks(all brusts into laughter)he using Ganger again creates an illusion to play a prank on Brock of all people who was most incensed with him and viseversa for trying to detach hia flower from him(all laughs)..by-the-way,sweet sweet Brock(all laughs) is in a real danger now which his sweet sweet Trace(all laughes) got into today again as he was hugging his flower(Mehadi blushes, other two smirks) snatching her away from the kitchen threatening his mom of robbing her pokemon (all brusts into laughter) and his 15 year long nemesis again had to choose the exact same time(all brusts into laughter) to insinuate that(all again laughes) he was his flowers BEST choice(all laughs uncontrollably) which as usual he started with sweeting the man only to call a false alarm and forcing everyone out of the home with the intention to have the grand lunch here today(all brusts into laughter) and has probably showed Trace all kinds of hell that he didn't show me and rigourously proved to him about one being-two appearance-only for the illusion to break theory unless he truely has killed him(all brusts into laughter) which he will do as he now possibly has come to know the intricate details of each of those damn brats(all laughs) that had the audacity to even look at his flower(all brusts into laughter) while he wasn't (all brusts into laughter) which includes unmarried females as well(all laugh) as due to him this brand if young has always been a constant problem for him(all brusts into laughter) to handle and according to him they tried many pranks to get his attention off from his flower(all brusts into laughter) as well as the threat that they might've influenced his flower rubbing her the wrong way(all laughs uncontrollably) so Brock being a constant encouragement of such brats(all laughs),his time is really numbered(all brusts into laughter) though hopefully in the last hours of night Trace of all people again to his utter disdain(all laughs) had the audacity to call him and insinuate (all laughs) that his actions weren't right(all laugh)..and you know thank God that i snatched his phone away otherwise he would've again set Ganger upon on you(all laughes) and this was after he could give the ring(smile,blush) which if wasn't the case Trace would've been in such hellfire that no vulture(all laugh) ever could've insinuated him out of it(all brusts into laughter)...then Trace rather idiotically forces her flower to compell him to call Brock to God(all laugh) at that time of night,and already these little Vultures insinuating around him if weren't enough(all brusts into laughter) only for him now they had their dirty eyes on his flower's beauty nap(all brusts into laughter) as well,so this sends him right into hell(all brusts into laughter) and i somehow managed to dissuade him from appearing on Ganger in Brock's bed that very night(all brusts into laughter) and that too having known that even on that day Brock had the audacity to not only doubt him but directly causing his flower some pain on her first night by insinuating (all laughs) her that he doesn't quite understand it,and this had put him out of his mind absolutely and he wanted to personally empty the whole Oak Lab pok√©mons on Cerulian and Brock(all brusts into laughter) and possibly on the whole world(all brusts into laughter) or may be alert the whole Elite4 to crush every vulture(all laugh) that ever appeared on Cerulian sky that day(all brusts into laughter) but he would've absolutely loved to completely devour sweet sweet Brock(all laughs) himself and i barely managed to calm the Gyarados of Gyradoses down(all brusts into laughter) only to tell him to phone-it-out(all laughs),which he obliged and started with telling Brock that he expected more help from males than females during his separation (all brusts into laughter) which to his utter disdain turned out to be the exact opposite(all brusts into laughter) making him absolutely loath every being on the planet apart from his mom and flower(all brusts into laughter),as Brock tried to make a sentimental comeback saying he hadn't spoken for 3/4 years,he just thunder chaired him off(all brusts into laughter) saying whether Brock was insinuating that(all laugh) he needed to announce to the world his longing for his beau(all laughs absolute uncontrollably)\"\n(few moments later,Mehadi lying down still has a fit of laughter,Daisy also laughes aloud,as we as Lillie)\nDaisy(laughing) : \"then Brock still had the audacity to challenge him to a rigourous insinuate-it-out(all brusts into laughter) which truely made sweet sweet Brock(all brusts into laughter) his biggest ever singular enemy ever imaginable(all again laughs)\"\nMehadi(laughes) : \"then suddenly Brock decided to connect with sweet sweet Viol of all people...(all brusts into laughter)..who started with screeching him names to which he politely pointed out that it'll only harm her song performances (all uncontrollably laughs) which startled Viol so much that she(all laugh)said why was he not sleeping then(all brusts into laughter) to which he scoffed to Viol of all people that her beau was feeling lonely (all uncontrollably laughs) which again incensed Viol so much that she was about to go overdrive and just as she thundered the first b..(all laugh) he politely pointed out that at that moment the b.. is trying to dissuade Mehadi flower form attacking him(Mehadi blushes,others pat her)..which truely threw Viol off her track(all laughes uncontrollably) buying him the time(all laugh) to growl at Brock why was he so incensed about the fact that he called him a lunatic un.. l.. r.. Infront of his then beau(all shakes their heads) and showed some fake documents (all shivering)..no wait this is what makes him the Pokemon  Master,as he fired these two both Viol and Brock went into overdrive,in the meantime he came back to quickly adore his flower once more(Mehadi blushs and laughs,others laugh),reminding his flower to not let the gentleman-fox(all Laughs) and his sinister flower(all laughs,Daisy Laughs out loud) mingle longer with her.(all laughs uncontrollably) and return to Brock to God to Viol(all laugh) that as he was saying(all laughs) he only did Viol the Greatest service of her life..and um..Dase this is what we've been wondering about that how can he be proved right even in this case..which utterly stops Viol as Brock then tries to make a insinuating comeback(all laugh) that what was he upto with Mehadi,to which he scoffs that why was he upset that while he gave Brock the chance to pick Viol flower which he happily obliged,Brock of all people never gave him the chance to pick up his Mehadi flower,then as all was totally silent including God to Viol(all laughs) he growled at Viol that he sweared her husband out of his slumber for all wrong flowers to make him realize the right one and now Viol flower was insinuating (all laugh) to him that he will tear apart Mehadi flower,whom he has gone through so many hells to get to(all smile),at which though Viol Flower didn't like this constant flower business (all uncontrollably laughs) anymore,she had to admit that she's so happy with Brock(all brusts into laughter) to Brocks abject failure to swear at the Pokemon Master..(all laughs)...now that Brock to God to Viol Flower all having calmed down the master played the master trick telling Viol to take rest as she had to fly out that very morning(astonished)..no i didn't know either how he guessed that,to which he later told that a perfectionist like Viol when it comes to her performance would always be calmed down with that enough to get herself concentrated again by being distracted(all laughs) so he played a guess and suddenly that turned out to be right as he also thought otherwise Viol being Voil won't stay awake at that time unless she had a plane to catch the very morning being a perfectionist (all brusts into laughter),the he himself sweet talked Viol off saying his pathetic 17 year journey(all laugh) has made himself rather detached from the world of art(all brusts into laughter) which he would like to rekindle may be sometimes later(all laugh) with the addition that he has travelled the whole world but whether Brock thought this Mantyke(all brusts into laughter) was the most artistic (all brusts into laughter) to this Brock was dumbfounded (all laugh) as Viol was very happy and went on to tell Brock how sweet her Mantyke was(all laugh),then congratulated Ash on his title and Mehadi flower and got disconnected(all laugh)\nthen he sweared Brock left and right basically telling him that a half-grown brat(all laugh) like him should've been the first to realize his heart-wrenching pain for his flower(all smiles,Mehadi blushs,giggles) and he did the exact opposite only by encouraging underground sludge to flow upto the ground and try desparately to reach his flower,and some portion of which had the audacity to challenge him during his Unova Elite4 battle by insinuating something(all shake their heads)..no Dase this is the only time i saw him angry and you won't like to face it as yesterday just after he started to torture me i saw that same fire in his eyes when he instructed his pokemons to snatch mine away and if any brat human or pokemon disturbed him today despite Pikachu being there,he threatened his bunch to forsake them forever (all very concerned)..he told them not to kill any persons but if there were any pokebrat(all smile) misbehaving including mine,then to mercilessly kill them off(all shivering)after the first warning and he engaged his 4 pokemons to make sure i don't have a heart attack or faint or any discomfort(all shivers) which um..well...Bulbasaur and all else were excellent and he sleep powdered me just at the right times and just enough to make myself calm down while i could hear and congnize,a pokemon did that like the most professional doctor(all wonder)..which he later said Bulbasaur being the eternal guardian to all, understood to some extent from body movements and inferred condition of humans now that he was always beside Gary as well,so he trusted him on this,and Bulbasaur behaved just like a human,which actually is Ash's biggest strength that he knows he has atleast one of the 85 beings beside him all the time including Mime,that would be beside him till infinity (all smile)he told me many times that they too were his soulmates(all smile, hugging Mehadi)...then i saw what sort of height pokemon master's pokemons has reached all did things like a well trained Military with Snorlax bossing around the area and he was from orange and yeah he gave Ash the Hoenn league but only then isaw the might of him,that adorable snoring sleeping round teddy bear looked like he has gobbled up the whole world and has become its gurdian and sole responsibility.. and truely Lil, that little sweet Pikachu that plays around no matter what he did in Sinnoh or Kalos,this Pikachu's was just burning as if nothing in the world could go past him that day no matter who they were or how many and as if he had become Ash himself,then that devillish determination to the goal to obey his master no matter what...(all wonder and shiver)..and the whole other lab pokemons were so disciplined and this was itself a false alarm as he told me..(all wonder)...as he later casually laughed it off saying Snorlax's concern and Pikachu's rage was enough for the rest of his own to follow suit and the others to properly behave all the while Bulbasaur and his Dark gang worked upon me without being disturbed by anything outside as if they've forgotten everything except me..Bulbasaur looked after me just as any professional doctor would do and his 3 dark types were at my nerves and somehow made myself feel a bit light just as i saw them each time as if they were trying to tell me why are you so concerned?you'll get through this and then we'll play around all we want...after each of his hellrounds one by one mercilessly tore my body apart...well,um..he started with swearing me then completely scoffed away..um..purity(Daisy&Lillie shivers)...Dase,what he did to me mentally and verbally,no h.. b... would be able to do that in their wildest dreams physically,he tore apart every bit of my body simply by swearing them off then came to my mind where every idea of kindness etc he mercilessly attacked...you can realize now what he was doing (all smile)..he just was desperately trying to take my focus away from body and sentiments and emotions to the soul and in the same process i was watching what he was doing to himself he was just thrashing himself to death before me and waiting for me to follow suit all the while his pokemons were robotically doing what they were told to...and i finally had my moment and we finally patched up when his jovial real self came out and that did what it did(all smile),that torture..unless one himself have gone through it several times and knows every bit of can subject another to that..and he was swearing me left and right to insult me at the same time he sweared me even more only to remind me that i had the strength to follow suit and he knows it...he had more faith in me than myself which actually..um..(blushes)\nDaisy(smile,patting Mehadi) : \"your own faith in his abilities when he first started out,just repayed you that(Mehadi giggle and blush)\"\nLillie(smile) : \"truely a Pokemon Master\"\nMehadi(blush) : \"yeah that's what he told and you know why he told that and i just realized what Ash Ketchum had become...just like in Pokemon World,he doesn't have any match in this world when it comes to control over his neves even when as he was dying and on that of any Pokemons...he in the meantime battled me to show his power,i was incensed enough myself,he got Gyarados of all for me,and used Bulbasaur who just stood there like a statue looking at Gyarados,who to my then worst nightmare..you know the best that in my own powers, Gyarados was just like the Master's Pokemons if not more and that Gyarados despite me screaming my head off to flamethrow Bulbasaur,kept looking at Bulbasaur and Ash,then looked at me as if she couldn't believe why she was out of the Pokeball itself,then just calmly lied down beside me,and i've barely seen her lie down and she did it while on the ground,which she hasn't than more than once or twice before...i was scared to death as i couldn't believe my most trusted sweety just left me at that moment..to which Ash just smiled and came and tendered her..and even at that point i saw,he was still the same playfull kid to Gyarados as ever,and my Gyarados looked at him with the same care that she has ever done to me if not more...then Ash recalled her again and that sweet tender Ash of mine whom i just couldn't help but to fell for since the first sight(all tender Mehadi),just in a moments notice went to the next devillish hell and Bulbasaur nonchalantly returned to tender me as if nothing ever happened for Ash only later telling me,if he pushed himself to the limits he could control lenegdary pokemons at his will as well but not for a long time and he was at that moment hismself torturing him to death as well and then on my Gyarados of all pokemons,he just tamed her as if she was his soulmate too(all tears)...and i saw then his real power and slowly realized that none could rescue me from this demon except myself(smile,all else smile) and just went on;none can reach it unless he's ferociously honest with himself that he can never harm any pokemons or their trainers no matter what his words and behaviour were and he told me if that was my Goldy, Goldy probably would've hugged him to death as he knew him personally for a long time..my Goldy would've been so assured no matter what was happening to me that he would cuddle my oppressor and it's lunatic in normal condition but if Gyarados could do that,Goldy could certainly do that(all shiver and smile)..he told me his only concern when it comes to My pokemons is Dewgong as he is the Gym's leader pokemon,he Ash can't tame psychologically no matter what,but i was only happy cause no matter how strong Dewgong is,he would've been totally torn apart by the whole Lab pokemons that day if he didn't budge at Bulbasaur's first warning,as i only later came to know that he wisely gave me Gyarados and not Dewgong,cause he himself would have been able to stop all but Pikachu if Dewgong attacked Bulbasaur as Pikachu just about turned to Gyarados but Noivern,who was closely observing Gyarados,he didn't come close as Noivern signalled him that Gyarados isn't misbehaving,you can imagine what level his pokemons are at and all Bulbasaur did was to signal Gyarados that,Ash was trying to help me calm down only(smile,all smile),Lil,Dase when later he told me his pokemons are his soulmates i realized what he meant,it is a fully trained unmatched battelion except Pikachu and Mime who would go to any hell with him,Mime was spared for his Mom,though she can herself become pretty insanely unstoppable with all her psychic powers cause she alone has to defend Mrs Ketchum if she wished so and Pikachu's temperament is that he is Ash's big brother(all smile),so he would rather look after him than to follow him(laugh,rest smile) and this itself made him most dangerous to anything that Ash felt any threat from..\"\nLillie(smile) : \"yeah,Gary said he has never seen anything like a phenomena Pikachu has become,because Ash wont battle him again he's upset and thinks his 'lil bro has gone to the bushes(all laugh loudly) so he won't talk with him much(all laugh hard), that's why he keeps a bit distance from Ash since he has returned..\"\nDaisy(laughing) : \"well he threatened his sweet sweet Trace today with Pikachu right Mehu?(all laugh)\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"the moment he heard Trace,he screamed Thunder Chair(all laugh)..and Pikachu threatened Trace like nothing(all laughs)..\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"it's unbelievable that how those little pests can threaten or fondle anybody according to Ash's will and yet mean no harm,the first time he came back,as soon as Trace pronounces \"Mehu\" he brusts into \"Thunderbolt\" and Pikachu scared Gary and Trace to death by jumping on Trace only to scratch his nose(all laugh)politely(all laughs uncontrollably)\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"right,later we were told unless Ash really means it,Pikachu won't even attack a single pokemon but Ash's only concern is that if Pikachu is with him and someone puches him and something and he gets angry and gets involved but the opposition is more powerful or more in number for the Master to insinuate himself out(all laugh) and getting angrier and feeling physically threatened during a long skirmish,then if Pikachu is with him or near him or somebody brings him to Ash,even Ash can't stop Pikachu from thunder chairing the whole world(smile)Grandpa' said there's no record of a Pokemon being able to judge his Master and even boss him around like Pikachu can do,so Ash calmed the brat(all smile) down saying he's done many things for a long time why doesn't he take rest at home(all laugh) and at the same time insinuating that Pikachu(all laugh) has become too lazy and wants to drink too much(all laugh) so Pikachu also got angry and conspiring with Mime and Ganger(all laugh) eat all his food, tickled him whole day whenever they caught him,and pestered him the whole night(all laugh),so the two brothers aren't on good terms(all laugh) though they're too professional (all laugh) to bring their personal matters(all laugh) to their business partnership (all brusts into laughter)\"\nMehadi(laughing) : \"mom was insinuating (all laugh) that if Ganger and those other two sinister dark devils(all laugh) has done something to Ash(all laugh) as she isn't fond of Ganger(all laugh) as he pesters her as usual(all laugh) and Mime is too disobedient while Ash is around(all laugh),Pikachu isn't talking with Ash(all laugh) and the other two unknown Devils that Ash has got straight from hell(all laugh) doesn't seem to have saintly motives(all brusts into laughter)..to which i told her a bit of Ash's supremely heightened ability and nerve control,to which she opined that he must be lonely then(all brusts into laughter),giving Ash the golden chance to re-insinuate(all laugh) her that she herself has just admitted that he can even infront of his mom adore his flower(Mehadi blushes, others pat her)\"\nDaisy(laughing) : \"..all he wants and making a deal with Mrs Ketchum that unless he gets to fondle his sweet sweet flower all the time,Mime is going to circus(Mehadi blushes,others smirk and pat) with his sworn-in(all laugh) enemy,the gentleman-crook(all brusts into laughter)\"\n(few moments later)\nMehadi:\"then after calming down Gyarados he again went on to torture me...and so on..anyhow when he looked that way scoffing at Brock,i felt scared to which he just pat my head(blush,rest smile) and told me that it was again his trash talking that'll work,which did...Brock got infuriated to start that game which was exactly what he dragged Brock to and then you know the rest(all smile)..and about the sludges he told me that they went to Unova and no he never wanted to know about them or why they had come but could see them that they had some personal problems with him and they suddenly challenged him just before his E4 match as he out of irritation scoffed at them,which he calmly accepted just for Kingler to nonchalantly adore the sludge brands biggest strength Slobro to gleefully submit as if Slobro was her long lost best friend,and as sludges couldn't believe what they just saw and,the public glare eventually lightened upon dark sludges for disturbing the Elite4 challenger who was a budding once ever enigma with his Kalos win itself..and sluges were such buffoons that they thought they could beat all Elite4 with with their lackies just because they won Kanto and Orange around retirement (scoff)...sludges  being a well known enough for the stench emanating,it took Ash some trouble but still he managed to utterly fool around with Unova Elite4 in all departments and saved the sludges from public humiliation by changing their names and so on..yup Pokemon Master made his biggest enemies his absolute pets in no time by humility, actually triggering my depression to that worst turn only for he himself to rescue me(fondles her ring and Giggle,all group hug)..oh and on our first night he again praised the sludges that went to challenge him to Unova,saying he in that position would've done the same but he then just complained that the boneheads should've realized that not many people can win 6 leagues and then the last one with that kind of utmost nonchalancy and playfullness and that too after winning all 32 badges of that Region,(proudly)22 Badges in Unova,11 in Sinnoh,(kisses her ring fondly)winning the final as 1 vs 8,and these all are much later,my Ash even before this has won 2 leagues and battle frontier(kisses her ring) with a few contest ribbons as well,and the boneheads did what they did...Ash said that they should've realized that may be none ever has fooled around in a league Final and just laughing his challenger off to defeat(fondly kisses her ring)...all these none has ever done this and they can't from unless they were very honest to the core(all smile,Mehadi kisses her ring fondly again),thus the sludges didn't need to be concerned about their beaus's former crushes at least as long as it was about him no matter what the press told about him,even if he had fondled the sludge's beau ever,he has no jealousy about it and won't pester his honeymoon at all(angry, others tender Mehadi)..and Dase,Lil,actually i realized what a disservice the sludges did to both of us,after that he praised the sludges to heaven for winning Kanto,which he himself could only reach upto the last 16(all smile)..(in a proud,tense voice) without telling the sludges that it was only Master's very first and even with his catterprie the Master would've sludged the sludge's sludge slobro on the very second day of his journey in his sleep...(Mehadi kisses her ring fondly,other tenders Mehadi,calm voice broad and proud smile)and he even congratulated the sludges for being a two league champions and atleast having the guts to stand up for their beau(shivering voice,others smile) no matter how tough a hurdle Ash Ketchum posed(smile,tears,others pat Mehadi)...praising the sludges again,now he bore the dirt thrown yet saving the sludges from Elite4 wrath and public humiliation..then the sludges still don't know what a grave mistake they committed,it could've been that very moment they could've been thunder-chaired to their adorable dreams(shivers)..by stating that they were straight from Cerulian seaweage...(shiver)..as they were so greatful that they wanted to be f.. around like all those h..b.. waiting at his feet all the time..(angry,tears,all pats Mehadi).(smile,Mehadi kisses her ring very fondly again)..and look at the Master's heart even then,he complemented him saying he expected this from a Cerulian and that too being a two league champion and the City was near Pallet his respect has only increased to meet some real sludges like them straight from Cerulian drains(all laugh)..(laugh).. though now we know all about it..(all laugh)...but i didn't understand it when the sludges returned and again was trying to stench my gym went so overboard just cause they were given the opportunity by the Master to have a coffee,thet they went on insinuating me if they were me they would've thrown themselvs at the Master's feet all the time...(tears,kissing her ring again,all pats Mehadi)...no,Dase,Lil,after all this i can tell you why exactly i got so depressed and this was it...and the reason was the Master himself,and Ash started to torture me and just mouth off my purity from exactly this point(tears,again kisses her ring fondly)...i then just realized what Ash mercilessly told me yesterday that he had me for 13 years and had my whole mind and body totally scanned and i of all didn't need to hide anything from him just like he himself,we grew up together(kissing the ring)..he never bothered about any physical closure with me despite knowing my devotion for him(sobbing)..and you yourself know what he says here...he told me that he was infatuated with me,attracted to me,and no neither did i ever notice anything except may be he kept his hands on my shouldrs a bit too long or held my hands a bit too long or gazed my face a bit too long with adoration...(all smile,Mehadi kisses her ring fondly again)..and that's all.he just liked to pass time alone with me that's all.and there too,never went overboard about any compliments at all except the 'you look cute' or when he was my boyfriend would just pat my hands while saying that and that's all...he never hugged me in any other way than a good friend does,not even when he was my boyfriend,not even the day we had our first kiss(tears,kisses her ring adorably, others pat)...never any more than that despite me only being his one nod away from getting all over him and especially all the time i saw him after his sinnoh miracle...and all we ever did then was to have one kiss,and that too he yesterday said was all his fault if he got weak like a h.. b..yeah said it to himself..that day and couldn't keep to himself despite me not wanting that but may be ultimately agreeing to cause i got too emotional and he said may be he shamelessly took a chance on my warmth for him(tears,kisses her ring)...and he was my boyfriend,he knew how much i wanted him,still apologized yesterday if i wasn't in the mood that day and he was a shameless..\"\n(tears,kisses her ring,others tears,pats her)\nLillie(tears) : \"Mehu,i've now realized what he told me yesterday and why he was so nonchalant about it that he didn't even bother to appologize,he knew what me and Gary meant to each other and he knew the past and he hit that point only to see if we'd still believe him to be just fooling around or not..we never would but i get his point now...if it was so strong why would you be too emotional no matter what,which i was..just laugh it off some times later.it's still within family and all knew who you were including grandpa...(sobbs)..and we've known each other for so so many years that yes we've found our soulmates but its still at the end an extremely unique bond that we share may be even more than a family and that's why nothing can topple it,nothing none would be bothered about,we are just too known too each other that even the very private life never mattered just that we don't need to rigourously talk about it and that's all,Mehu you can realize when he went on to the comparisons,he broke apart anything we might ever have felt about others in our darkest and weakest days,but now we were way ahead,but if that wasn't yet cleared,the master would insinuate-it-out(all laugh)...(smile)that little brat trash talked us to his beloved hellfires to break any barrier that he felt were insinuating (all tears and laugh) something by totally mortifying himself and yes if he does that again we'll do the same but..if you get me...\"\nDaisy(sobbing) : \"he tore himself apart from us solidifing our bond by killing off any unimaginable Cerulian sludge(all tears,laugh) who may ever dare to vulture around(all smile)outside on in our mind itself  due to the past and the unique bond...all the while we loathed him to absolute hell,he just sweard off any reservations we could ever imagine\"\nLillie(smile) : \"no we don't imagine that and that brat should've known it(all laugh) but he mercilessly thunder-chaired all unimaginable vultures(all smile) that made his own life a living hell,even before they dared to come into existence even mentally,especially as our children would grow up and new staffs would come in and all that...a change of guard...and most glaringly and that was his point he was about to do that himself,our soilmates would only get closer and closer..and all darkness would be sweared off to hellfire rounds where he would go too..(all laugh)that little obsessive self-destructive pest indeed is a new meance to personal space\"(all brusts into laughter)\nDaisy(smile) : \"and this same thing he did to Brock,and now look at him...for all his qualities the vulture-killer(all laugh) sweared off his one mental barrier without knowing what it was but just doing enough insinuattion(all laugh) to Brock to insinuate-it-out(all laugh) himself...Mehu,we need your beau as well(all brusts into laughter)\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"and even if he went to hell yesterday,and many years later any vulture(smile) suddenly appeared in our wildest dreams,we would remember that merciless swearing-in ceremony (all laugh) so that the Vultures will again be proved that truely nowhere can they ever catch the Pokemon Master..(all brusts into laughter)\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"Mehu,in your trance travelling as soul,next time remember Vultures are always there(all brusts into laughter)\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"especially the godforsaken Cerulian breed(all again brusts into laughter)\"...\n(all laughs for a few moments)\nMehadi(smile) : \"but you know he then told the sludges that their girlfriends were in safe hands and he wished them luck(all smile)..this he told me at night,so then i realized why those sludges was so overjoyed that day...(smile)....and Dase,Lil,even yesterday,even after giving me,his soulmate the engagement ring for which he totally mortified hismself for so long,but then making me feel his eternal wife just in hours,my Ash still told me that if he never came,i would've been in safe hands(tears, kisses her ring fondly,others pat Mehadi)\"\nDaisy : \"really Mehu,the sludges are really lucky that they ever even had a chance to meet a person like this\"\nLillie : \"yeah,and hopefully it gives them a better life\"\nMehadi (tears,smile) : \"and also after i got to know his pokemons powers over nerves his own powers etc and this is after i got my ring, suddenly as if something had bitten him,some memory,he just forced me away from him and fervently apologized that if i ever think that he forced me to be with him using his powers and pokemons and something illegal that his association with the team rocket busting operation made him familiar with,he told me even then that if i thought so,he fervently apologies and even then(tears,smile,kissing her ring),even then told me if i thought he has got me back deceitfully,i can still leave him immediately,he will be doing whatever i tell him to apologize properly(tears, kisses her ring again very tenderly)..\"\nLillie(smile) : \"Mehu,even if he has deceived you,you won't get a better man in any lifves(hugs Mehadi) if there's more than one...\"\nDaisy(patting Mehadi) : \"you know we never really thought Ketchum was the right one for you,never...i had my doubts till i heard that speech myself..no man or woman who doesn't longed for his beau with all soul imaginable,can so intricately yet so nonchalantly say the things he said...after that me and Trace we just kept looking at each other then both smiled and Trace said that he never believed Ash and Mehadi could be separated since he saw them(Mehadi blush,Lillie smile,smile) he said that he had seen people fooling around and fighting in between to be close and all that but this fight was so sweet that he felt none actually ever wanted it to stop at all and would rather like to literally kill each other than to stop or be friends;this fighting just was an expression of their intense loging for each other all the time,simply because their longing for each other was so deep that they just at that age couldn't help but to fight-it-out(all laugh) all the time to express that to each other that without the other they just can't think anything,this longing was so intense for their 14 year selves,it was just impossible to grasp and manifest it...and i told him that i never believed in Ash but not only has he proved me totally wrong he has depicted to me,my own journey and longing for my soulmate so vividly yet so enjoyably that i would say i wish i was in those rounds again and again just to enjoy it again and again(all smiles)\" \nMehadi(smile) : \"yeah,and when i then just scoffed at him when he was insinuating (all laugh) that i may think he was deceived me,he again went onto proving as to what was he doing, but this time very na√Øvely and again was about to play his hellfire rounds and this time it was more dangerous cause he wanted to show me that indeed he has cheated thus now he would again tear himself apart and let me see his self destruction till i got my answer,but this time i just gave a good scolding(all laugh) and he calmed down(giggle)\"\nDaisy(smile) : \"no Mehadi,he can get extremely ferocious upon himself if he feels that he has to show his soul to someone,get a lease on him(all smile)\nLillie(laugh) : \"Mehu,I was thinking that your beau is a sort of a person that if he caught you cheating on him,rather than doing anything else would totally destroy himself to see if he had any problems himself to begin with (all smile)...really get a lease on him and get this idea of having to prove every step logically so that none can insinuate(all laugh)anything,get this out of his head\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"yeah,but at present even i wouldn't be able to cause sweet sweet Brock hasn't even seen him yet(all brusts to laughter) and he has already declared his most intense longing for this beau(all brusts into laughter) of his,i'll be there with him when he thunder chairs Brock(all laugh) cause otherwise for a person like Brock if doesn't submit easily Ash will frequently appear anytime in his bedroom on Ganger(all brusts into laughter) and if we have our sweet sweet Viol Flower there(all brusts into laughter) by good luck,it'll go out of hand as his Ganger himself is in the eternal hall of fame when it comes to tickling around(all brusts into laughter)..but as i was saying what he did after his encounter with the Cerulian sludge that actually started his antics and trash talks...he said he later kinda had an intuition that it might've been about me,but again at first he just brushed it off but then soon it made one permanent impression upon him as he himself was going through all hells then that no sludges no matter how f.. idiots they were would run after a man who not only could kill or snatch away all their pokemons literally but given his antics and popularity and mostly reach could even make their lives a permanent hell,why would they run after him as he never got remotely close to any woman except Mehadi and no herd of buffoons would chase after a man who was their girlfriends crush..so he soon realized it was about Mehadi indeed then also given the position of the sludges,and this name in itself itself just turned his head and forced him to tremendous hells as he remembered his Mehadi was so devoted to him deapite all popularity and he'd brush everyone aside no matter what came to his ears about me even after we broke up..and this yesterday he elaborately explained is a swearing-in(all laugh) that he never thought a Gym Leader like me unless herself budged,no vultures could touch her no matter what they would've achieved from outside but her core would remain as pure as ever...but then with his growing self realizations,these sludges did what they did,now he suddenly was all confused as of his Mehadi,what if he was wrong after all?what if she did out of desperation for himself did budge in the last days for someone and that's why broke up?..you know,he tortured me yesterday to get this fact clear that he wouldn't even look at any girl unless he had first broken up form his present girlfriend,when in a relationship,it just has to be honoured till break-up no matter how strainous it has become,only after the break up would he even look at any girl(tenderly cajoling her ring)...and so now, all those Vultures with there what ifs came around him and he was left totally bemused..but this really started his self mortification...he decided there was only one way to get rid of Mehadi completely and that is to find someone else as Mehadi might've done herself by now so that these sludges out of some irritation came to date him(all laugh)..then this made him most merciless because now look at how he went about finding his girlfriend (laugh,all wonder)..he would never look at anyone in a way he would do to his Mehadi,he just won't do anything that he did with Mehadi but the exact opposite,and the only difference was that Mehadi came to him herself so to oppose that he had to go to girls and then scoff and swear his head off to them for no reason(laugh,Daisy&Lillie shakes their heads)...but obviously he couldn't as that is absurd like going upto a girl by telling her 'hellow!i'm Ash Ketchum,Pokemon Master' and as soon as she say \"Hi!\" he would(laugh) go like hugging them and saying \"yeah stupid b...\"(all brusts into laughter)..so it was a huge difficulty...so he decided to do his antics and fuel his playboy images and as soon as any girl was too interested about him,they were sent right into(all laugh uncontrollably)..\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"the hell with his beloved Vultures\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"and their whole existence became a living insinuation(all laugh) that they were stupid b...\"(all brusts into laughter)\nMehadi(laugh) : \"exactly this,this is the exactly the way he started with me yesterday,no matter what i did he just kept throwing me away(laugh)..when i sweard at him,cried at him,got angy,was depressed,about to have heart attack,wanted to hug him, confessed that he indeed was my only man ever, rejected him,wanted to be friends with him only or tried to forget him,longed for him,got myself killed to show i do want him and never wanted anyone else,got emotional,tried to kiss his head off(all laugh) \n,even told him he was my soulmate anything i could imagine that i did,and no matter what i did,it became an insinuation(all laugh) that i had someone else in my mind but out of infatuation was trying to reconcile with him or i'll be better off without him or i was an absolute coward that i was budging too easily or all i wanted was to be f.. around or even(all laugh\n) i was kind,generous,warm, anything you can imagine all was an insinuation,when he admitted i only could read his soul,only showing it means is that he'll instantly want to bed me(all laughs),i just couldn't show him at all that i was indeed his Mehadi,to him-i was not his Mehadi's replacement at all,no matter what,his Mehadi couldn't be replaced and he was brutally showing it to his Mehadi herself(all laugh)...and it was me who he ever have had any feelings for,and finally till he could show me that state where it'll be imbibed in me what real soulmate is,and even after that to prove words like chastity or ideas like bedding anyone meant absolutely nothing to him(all laugh)...really it wasn't till i was on his same level of nonchalancy with anything that can be expressed or imagined,i never became his Mehadi,his Mehadi was he himself so i had to realize that my Ash is also me myself.. only then the did the devil confess(all laugh\n)...and he intentionally preyed upon me yesterday (all laugh) cause my name was Mehadi(all brusts into laughter) and he happened to know me well(all brusts into laughter)...so you can understand what would happen to anyone if he didn't know well at all(all laugh)..and to him now i realize knowing well was also defined by Mehadi(all laugh),that is till he knew everything about a girl for like 20 years(all brusts into laughter),he won't consider her well known at all(all laugh)...and that's why he decided,so when he saw that none were any match for even on the most basic s.. hurdle(all brusts into laughter),what to speak of it when he will tell them you're my soul only to insinuate(all laugh)that it simly meant he wanted to f.. around(all laugh) and whatnot..he would tear apart every faith you ever had on kindness,gallantry,everything would become so garbage that he would basically tell you either you're my girlmon(all brusts into laughter) or a stupid b..(all laugh)...and whatnot,finally if you passed all he'd start laughing at you that i'll f.. around anybody except you all the time how about that(all smile)...you had to show him that you've grasped the fact that you were he himself..and that's self realization so you can't show it to him at all(laugh)..only if you went there and still came back and fully comprehend his absolutely carefree innermost self which he wanted yourself to understand as you yourself (all laugh)...he later told me,all he ever read or knew on philosophical things like this he desparately read more to have a grasp on what they may mean(all laugh),then went on with whatever he realized coupled with his own in-born beliefs to mercilessly mortify himself so that his Mehadi would appear from himself only(all laughs)...after we finally patched up yesterday he said exactly this,'i'd sit in a corner and you'll go all about it,i'll totally kill myself off and you'll totally live all of it,but if you're indeed the one then as soon as i kill myself completely,you'll automatically appear exactly there(laugh,others smile and clap)...literally he had so much belief that that's what soulmate would mean...\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"and he'll mercilessly describe this process again and again to you just like my sweet cunning man(all brusts into laughter)might still be self-learning(all again brusts into laughter). till he felt you can't insinuate anything else (all laugh) to him at all,he won't stop no matter what,Mehu,you've caught the greatest legend (all brusts into laughter)!\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"that no goddamn vulturemade Cerulian pokedex(all laughes uncontrollably) can ever insinuate about(all brusts into laughter)\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"and Dase,Lil,this basic name calling hurdle is so extremely devilish that it itself will totally destroy any girl(all laugh) and he recharged me up yesterday so many times by swearing-in encouragements (all laugh)..yeah(laugh),he'd call you a b..,you'll almost have a heart attack when he'll tell to to stand up unless you're a b..(all brusts into laughter)..and(laugh)..if you did manage to stand up,he'd tell you that you stood up is the very proof that indeed you're a b...(all laughes uncontrollably) ...plus he engaged his pokemons to look after me and no wonder that's all because it was his Mehadi,in his depth of soul he was indeed desperately longing to get me back,anyone else would've been volunteered to thunder-chair on the very first point when they couldn't take it anymore(all laugh)along literally with their godforsaken pokebrats(all laughes uncontrollably),had they too misbehaved by trying to obey their master(all brusts into laughter), and especially so as the Master's very own mad tempered big brother(all laughes uncontrollably) was sternly told that he'd not see his sweet little bro(all uncontrollably laughs) ever again,sending him to his most sinister mood(all laughs) pikachuable(all uncontrollably laughs)...and you remember that girl Serena-(laugh)the Master doesn't make one scene till she doesn't get on the ship cause he doesn't want her to miss it and there itself create a scene after being ceremoniously inducted into the hall of b..(all laughes uncontrollably)..then smiles to his other friends(all laugh) whose reactions he describes as 'the just crowned Kalos prince has just tasted and just smelt the just perfect Kalos stool'(all laughes uncontrollably)...then Ash said for the first time in his life he was in the wasroom for 40 minutes(all laugh) where he spat everywhere and puked his head off(all laugh) then come out and still never made any scene till it was his time to say goodbye,when in his language he sweetly smiled to his friends who thought \"Kalos Prince has been princely spat upon\"(all uncontrollably laughs) but then to their unimaginable disbelief (all laughs) the Prince sweetly (all laugh) tells them just that,that he has a girlfriend and he's going to tell her what just happened,if they can save Serena(all uncontrollably laughs) then sweetly greeted them goodbye(all laugh)...this was his exact view of anyone that ever tried to mingle with him too personally or physically...and then even more brutally(laugh)..Ash described as he didn't react,Serena thought that the Kalos Price is thinking that 'Ah!what a cough,what a spit'(all laughes uncontrollably)...so when he tried to phone her first,she doesn't pick up(all brusts into laughter)...only to make the Kalos Prince to follow his big bro meticulously(all brusts into laughter)...so he texts that he wants to declare his longing for his beau(all brusts into laughter)..and that he'll anyhow have to confess (all brusts into laughter) on e day...so finally,that girl then was phoned as soon as he got down and just as she was in cloud 9(laugh),picks up the phone(laugh),Ash sweetly says,'Serena it's Ash(all brusts into laughter)',as if to gauge if it was anyone else or not(all brusts into laughter)..and then you can imagine that girl's joy(all laugh),she just about stutters 'umm..'(laugh)..Ash goes, 'thanks for the urine'(all brusts into laughter)and then told exactly these things with the fact that as he was her dream since age of 4,she must be an in-born b..(all laugh)meaning if there were previous lives this was what she was,by soul she was a b..(all laugh),and that meant she is solely why there's a word called b..(all laughes uncontrollably) and as if the girl could insinuate (all laughes uncontrollably) any return with the promise to be changed,enter Prince's beloved girlfriend-the soulmate theroy(all laughs uncontrollably)..now he set his girlfriend upon on the sweet sweet girl(all laughes uncontrollably) to meticulously but mercilessly (all brusts into laughter) unvulturize (all brusts into laughter) the fact,that she was the textbook eternal b..mate(all laughes uncontrollably) to anyone she'll ever meet across all lives,as now she has just been immortalized as a b..(all shakes their heads and laughs),permanent existence across whole eternity(all laughs)...you can imagine what kind of insurmountable hell the poor girl was thrown in now that her soul itself has become a b..(all laughs)...and this is exactly what the Master did,just literally killed her off without any chance of any resurrection...(all shakes their heads)...and that's only the beginning (laugh),just after cannonizing the poor girl(all laugh),his parents were informed in exactly this language->\"i thank you wholeheartedly for allowing your daughter to travel with us throughout Kalos,your daughter has been very nice,a true s..,a great s..\"(all laughes uncontrollably,shaking their heads)..yes exactly this which startled her parents to all hellfires they'd ever come across buying the Master the precious time (all laughs) to narate what she did and finally and most brutally telling them that a half grown s.. like that shouldn't be allowed to roam around the world before cutting off(all shake their heads and laugh)...this requires Professor Oak and his mom's personal intervention to give the poor girl and their family who were thrown into literal eternal hell to have any chance of resurrection which is scoffed off to hell again (all laugh) in the presence of his own mom,when Ash says he's been cheated on his trust and humiliated in public by an eternal s..(all laugh),if they're telling him to reconcile,his only message is that for a playboy with his name and fame and reach and power to be concretely blamed upon would require an immediate biological proof(all shivers) which the subjects can analyze to get the meaning of(all shivers)...Dase,Lil,this is said in the presence of his own mom with utmost nonchalancy and you know he never saw his own father,no matter how great a man his father was,which he himself is very much aware of,you can understand what unimaginable level of self belief and dignity a man needs to do this...even pointing to his very own mom two things,that whatever she told him about his father he believes un absolutely and at the same time if it's not true,she,his own mom to him is exactly in that category for him...(all shivers)...and you know he says his mom is his soul...still at that moment for truth he was even willing to judge that as well...\"\nDaisy(shakes her head) : \"this is all too much... truely a legend across all hellfires unimaginable\"\nLillie(solemn) : \"and you see Dase,this you no matter what, can erase off from the Master's memory or can make him budge cause he himself says that he has felt this eternal hell himself as he was cheated on his trust so much that

they might've tried to pull any stunts on him(all laughs)he threatened the whole Elite4 to empty the whole area wherever he went(all laugh) or else he'll intentionally lose all rounds and later accuse them of not providing the right safety measurements(all laughes) and if even this wasn't enough then there was none other than our beloved Muk(all uncontrollably laughs)of all pokebrats (all brusts into laughter), hiding all the time in dark corners behind Ash(all laughes),which he intentionally chose to be at(all laughes uncontrollably),lurking for any female brat(all laughes uncontrollably) to breach a 3 foot specified circle (all laughes uncontrollably) to hug upon her mercilessly(all brusts into laughter)...and if even this wasn't enough the Master used his ultimate weapon by stating that he is getting married just after this championship finishes(all laugh) and thus wished if females behaved properly with him he would be happy (all laughes uncontrollably)...yes he said exactly this...as he has been humiliated in public before by many who hasn't been taught or was too ignorant in the class(all brusts into laughter) to differentiate between a brother and a beau (all laughes uncontrollably)..yes this he said and has shown me a copy of it cause he loved that antic so much which totally put anyone way off him(all laughes uncontrollably)...thus the poor family couldn't catch him(all laugh)...then ultimately he went to Orange, where his mind was a bit more disturbed as our sweet sweet gentleman(all laughes uncontrollably) had made life hell for him there all those years ago and as this legendary nemesis had the audacity to call him(all brusts into laughter)as Gary,who only was authorized to contact the master cause to him,Gary is the only person in the world who knew how to be most professional and least personal (all laughes uncontrollably) perfectly that charmed the Master's mood most(all laughes uncontrollably),but as Brock to God would have it the day(all brusts into laughter) he reached the island where a godforsaken brat of a gym leader (all laughes uncontrollably) to his only blame caught too much attention of the Master's blossoming flower(all laughes)in her teenage dreams(all laughes uncontrollably) unfortunately for her not to realize that after all her antics for two years(all laughs) finally had inducted her to the central attention of the Great Master(all laughes uncontrollably) apart from  his mad bro(all laughs uncontrollably)...for the first time in 2 years (all laughes uncontrollably) the Master suddenly felt a little tickle(all brusts into laughter) in his soul(all laughs) that his flower trying to flow (all laughes uncontrollably) to the wrong side(all brusts into laughter)...and if that memory at that time wasn't good enough this same full grown brat(all brusts into laughter) Danny now was the one to harshly remind him of his flower(all laughes uncontrollably),whom he instantly realized to be indeed the Master's eternal beau(all laughes uncontrollably) and thus only wanted to ask  the the Master if he has married her or someone else as the master had announced in Kalos(all brusts into laughter)...now as if all the names and memories wasn't enough suddenly comes marriage(all brusts into laughter) to make the Master surpass his big bro(all laughes uncontrollably) and just as the poor guy was about to be thunder-chaired,our sinister gentleman(all laughes uncontrollably) called him(all laughes uncontrollably) after many years as Gary wasn't there on an emergency and despite reminding the gentleman that the great master may call or have to be called and then just to tell him to wait and give it to the main staffs,with whom master consented to deal as they didn't pester him after his stern insinuation (all laughs) via Professor Oak,this good gentleman(all laughes) suddenly remembering his long lost beau(all brusts into laughter) wickedly asks (all laughes uncontrollably) him to tell him the island's name(all brusts into laughter)...and that was it(all Laughes uncontrollably)...the gentleman was told that the master was already dealing with many people who can't let go off certain personal issues only to remind him of it without realizing whether those were still fond to him or not(all laughes uncontrollably)...yes he said that to slaughter Danny completely...and now a man who suddenly breachs his agreement with his reservation Lab taking chances on his old contacts him,if these continues,he'll have to surrender all his pokemons and titles and badges and go back to being someone who hasn't heard the word Pok√©mon...this makes all parties to get absolutely slaughtered and startle Danny to all hells as to why this sweet sweet man,whom he couldn't forget in 14/15 years due to his utter clueless personal life(laugh) turning into an absolute enigma once he had to battle where thouhh then dormant yet an once ever flavour of unimaginable intuitive power shown through or his eternal flower(all laughs),who at that age just couldn't express properly what she was had inside for the master(laugh, others smile and pat Mehadi) thus resorting to various antics(all brusts into laughter),which all but the Master himself understood(all laughes uncontrollably),this sweet man was so gentle and behaved so warmly with him even after being reminded of that how famous a Gym Leader his flower had become(all laughs),which he then politely scoffed of as saying that yes,his flower was always excellent with water pokemons(all laughs) which though then didn't get Danny going then but he misunderstood the Master totally in this regard (all laugh),now as the Master salughtered him and his gentleman(all laugh),he finally realized that the Greatest Master will become the Greatest Legend(all laugh) if the name Mehadi Waterflower or her deeds was personally attached to him beyond friendship(all laughs)...so both Trace and Danny flew off to whichever hell they first saw(all brusts into laughter)...but during this all,to the greatest disdain to Master, suddenly these 'stools from Kalos'(all laughes) appeared as having the misfortune to be relatives to Danny(all brusts into laughter)...they appeared im front of the Master but thank God they and their pokebrats (all laugh) behaved as brother than beau(all brusts into laughter) and now the Master couldn't say anything to humiliate Danny,thus later agreed to meet them personally,given the condition of 3 foot circle(all brusts into laughter) and not trying to make themselves or their pokebrats the cherished food for his starving big bro(all laughes uncontrollably) and if this whole Elite4 feared infamous big bro wasn't enough(all laugh) as Ash knew that no matter what,he or his bro doesn't actually want to hurt anybody and that too to people who weren't at all proficient beyond the very common level when it came to Pokemons or their handling and though Serena travelled with him and could become a trainer which she is now and in Unova,the whole Elite4 combined was a child's play to the Master,so to his actual defense he used the his most unholy aoulmate(all laugh),his now right hand tickle master(all laughes uncontrollably),invisibily present on the 2nd foot in front of him(all laughes uncontrollably),which simply means death from laughter(all laughes uncontrollably) to even Suicune (all laugh)..and Ash then sternly tells them before anything that no matter what emotion may do,she should've realized that he ever behaved to her as a big brother and to him she was a little sister and she broke his trust only to insult herself and her family,to which the girl fervently apologized which was scoffes off as you know(all laugh) insinuation to get close to him again(all laugh)...this turned her family on who were thrown into hellfire as they accused of being egotistical b.. as that's exactly why they think he suits their daughter (laugh,all shakes their heads)...Dase,Lil,this is living hell if there's anything ever...which made all of them to totally break down...but this statement bought him(laugh,rest smile) the time to show his same insane level of generosity which is exactly why the girl and their family couldn't forget him or anyone else ever can no matter what he did to them if they've seen his heart...he basically babysit this girl into maturity and made other friends in Kalos to realize what life really is all about and taught the girl about pokemons,so now she finally realized what big brother she misunderstood as she'll never have one like him in all hells(Mehadi kisses her ring fondly,all smile)....(laugh,all wonder)..so now Ash finally showed them his true self telling the girl that she can keep im touch with Professor Oak,which all of her family was and just as she had started to do continue her journey through Kalos and learn about herself the most which'll be enough to interpret the world including that of the Pokemons(all smile,Mehadi again kisses her ring) and telling the family this time the rout out of the eternal hell as well saying 'pardon is bestowed only by own soul,not by anyone or anything else'(all smile,Mehadi kisses her ring tenderly) and simply walked off but(laugh) not before the tickle master suddenly became visible just infront of the girl(all brusts into laughter) like so many times he did to scare her in Kalos(all lauhh), to ultimately showing the Master's true fool around nature and simultaneously telling everyone that this hell was only to get the girl straightened forever(all smiles,Mehadi kisses her ring tenderly) and how lucky they're to even have the sight of this once ever Legend(all smile,Mehadi adores her ring)...and then later as Ash finally decided to raid me(all laugh),he gave me all this information briefly in his note to me,which according to my sweet Viol flower couldn't ever be romantic(all brusts into laughter) and tell her to phone me and Dase,Lil...the Master showes his Mastery again and what level of faith he had on himself and on his only weakness in this world(smile,all smile),that even after all that and 4 years of no contact and his history with Serena and Me and my depression and may be alleged after break-up affairs and all that,he tells the girl if she wants to meet a real Lady who could ever match her idea of Ash(all smile) in all quarters,she may call me after she gets to know from the Hall of Fame for Water Pokemon Gym Leaders who Mehadi Waterflower is and her contact s(all smile,all pats Mehadi) with the note that he even broke-up with me long before he stepped foot in Kalos and only recently had to meet her formally(laughes,all smile) due to his and her positions (all laugh,Mehadi shows her ring and giggles)...and knowing full well he was the centre of my full wrath then(shows her ring,all laughs) and this poor girl could be again resent hell(all laughes uncontrollably)...but such was his faith that his conscience was clear with both me and what he did to all in Kalos that despite his playboy image which Serena was very familiar with as the press said and all he knew he truely is uninsinuable (all smile) no matter what happened and his faith even then on me that Mehadi may've found someone else but or even have cheated on me just before break-up but i've also seen her devotion to a no-one despite her fame and skills and indeed it might be mine and my image which i didn't clarify forced her into that and still then she atleast broke-up rather than showing me her new beau(all laughs)..and even further he had the unflinching faith that no matter what i'll still behave properly with her as he has seen and known how i never even was rude but only very firm with all those that pestered me..my Ash remembered me for all the right reasons only and always(kisses her ring,others smile and pats her)...\"\nLillie(laugh) : \"Mehu,this legendary pest(all laugh) all along wanted you with unfathomable longing and devotion yet won't ever ask for a date or tell his friends about it(all laugh)\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"as it'll be an insinuation(all brusts into laughter)that she is all about bedding to him(all brusts into laughter)..Mehu,this eternal legend would've literally killed himself immediately yesterday had he not found his Mehadi in you(all brusts into laughter)..cause that would've been the last resort to see his real Mehadi...(all smile)..and exactly here the self-destructive Legend once more Masterfully shows what soulmate really is(all smile,Mehadi kisses her ring fondly and giggles)\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"and then the girl probably had followed suit(all brusts into laughter) after knowing my details as when she called me,she was trying her hand at that(all brusts into laughter)...i told her why was she so upset,we've had absolutely no contact for 4 years now except a few days ago when he came here...(laugh)..and see how the Master played both me and Serena,if i told her Ash is a cheat and he humiliated me,she would've believed in it and cut off from him,which saved him from her forever(all laugh) and at the same time throwing me to further hells as i knew he might've cheated on me but he still has shown me what this exact girl did to him and what she is doing now and this girl was with him after our break-up and was there when the press was going all about him..and also knowing that he humiliated me and broke into my room but that sinister note and all that and he did no physical harm to anyone or anything and even my Goldy of all insisted Pikachu can't do any harm to anyone ever(all smile)..my Gym Leader Dewgong told me they just didn't know what to do and nothing happened to them at all,my Gyarados of all told me she was only happy(all brusts into laughter)..and my Viol flower(all laughes) told me,this isn't a reconciliation note,he wants something else may be something is bugging his conscience(all smile)...and with all that i realized he infact in public humiliation, humiliated my depression away(Mehadi kisses her ring fondly, others pat her and smile)...and even if he did cheat,he still shown me his heart by driving my mental demons away,so with all that no matter what i would be dishonest to myself if i berate him and even if the girl cut off,her life itself will teach her how true each of the Master's words were no matter how much her trust from everything broke,the Reality is reality and the Master again by self humiliation and mortification would at the end of her life show her that no he is uninsinuable (all smile) and also to me that whatever Ash Ketchum may have become,in my most desparate moment,he repayed me my faith and devotion to him while tearing himself apart from me by the veil of public humiliation,(tears,kisses her ring)as if your Ash is cruel to humiliate you in public but Mehadi,you'll see i've only helped you(tears,fondles her ring)...\"\n\nthis just for one moment of emotion,which i myself was so close to when i parted him first time(blush,all smile),which he himself later insinuated out of me(all laugh),and Serena has spoken with me, she's as sweet a girl as you could imagine..and this was her treatment all cause he alwasy showed her he was her big brother thought she finally realized,but when he was brutally proved wrong,he became the monster he showed me yesterday...and she called today morning as just after his Orange Elite4, Serena's dad and all personally came to patch up,for which first they were told they were only after him cause of his name and fame then finally they said no she really means it,she has changed and whatnot,then he finally said he had a girlfriend whom he had broken up but still wanted to patch up but wasn't sure,in the meantime this b.. did what she did..and all this was because Professor Oak personally was involved...so she got a chance with the fact that if he ever got back to his girlfriend,she can do whatever she wished with her,that girl still didn't budge so when finally she could get to me,who was fed her name so that she got even more insulted,was crying like anything to me making me totally dumbfounded,and he told her that he decided to break up but still a b.. like her needed to apologize if she had any whatever left in her and whatnot...and she was like so sorry you can't

fond of his Mehadi Flower(Mehadi blushes and hugs Daisy),too sweet..\"\n\n\n...and he said that that he had me at his mercy,the head-turning Cerulian water queen who was cherished by all Vultures of all breeds(tears) at his mere mercy even when he was a no one and you know people started to pester me as soon as i learned to use Gyarados,for which the Master always has praised me to all heavens and even to his own mom once more today(kisses her ring again gently,all smile patting Mehadi,tears)...so Ash just mercilessly tore apart my body while doing the same to himself by saying he was a unique man even then that such a girl was devoted only to him and as soon as the sludges insinuated (smile) that,i rememberd then as Ash again scoffed at me,that a then no-one like him needed only a nod or smile to get the Water Queen all over him(kisses her ring again,others pat Mehadi)..and you know how true it was when he returned from Battle Frontier itself,and compared my Ash,the one and only man with whom i'd ever even imagine in my wildest dreams to be physical but also with whom i'd lose every bit of purity i can ever imagine if he so wished(all tears,Mehadi kisses her ring with fondness)...where my man stood with his behaviour fully knowing who his girlfriend was and what she wanted,that Ash with what these sludges were saying(tears,kissing her ring again very fondly)...and then the sludges got what they long deserved and i realized that it won't be so easy to erase Ash off so easily and i went into the death fight with myself,which eventually only my Ash realized with along with his own realizations and look,half a day and i like have been his wife forever(all tears,Mehadi fondly kisses her ring again)\n\n just as he told him..and then told went in saying get a hold on his nerves and don't get involved with unnecessary skirmishes and your girlfriend is very lucky to have you(all tears)..yeah(tears)..he said that as you know i too came to infer..(all tears)...and the sludge just got so dumbfounded that Brock was scoffed to hell...and Lil,even after giving me the ring he still told me,even after all that,that i would've been in safe hands(brusts into tears)...\n\n he's from Kanto,that name\n\nLillie(smile) : \"and Brock too i guess is his pet now?\"\nDaisy(laugh) : \"and Viol..(all laugh loudly)\nDaisy(laugh) : \"the way he told Viol to also keep her pokemons fresh look after her family and all that so amusingly as if our own elder brother was saying but the language was so funny that you just laughed yet firmly got his message,Viol probably is his biggest fan now(all laugh)\"\nLillie(smile) : \"Mehu,you were talking about chastity,Gary last night told me Ash ,once when 11 scoffed at some guy who was 16 or so on a party or kinds thing when he was insinuating Ash(all laugh) that he should talk with girls and so on,that 11 year old brat suddenly scoffed \"what's the point if the difference persists?\" flustering all,which finally he showed all of us what he meant that day,Gary ever daid that was the real Ash..Gary said Ash was the most ordinary guy,and you'd know Mehu(all smile),and Gary even says this pokemon master as well isn't a big thing etc..i only just about realized what Gary can't say in words,the Master Brat(all laugh) insinuated(all laugh) the soulmate thing extremely well at 11..but then it was just 1 year(Mehadi blushes,all smile)\"\nMehadi(laugh) : \"i can tell you now just due to Ash,when i said yesterday you're a cheat,he went on with that chastity thing mercilessly showing me that it means nothing to him and at the same time showing he didn't cheat on me till our break up..i was so stuttered then he said why would you budge even if your body was paralyzed, won't the mind work,totally laughing off this most private matter of women just as if it was absolutely nothing to him..(laugh) then he showed dying in battlefield and giving a friend a glass of water which he can't reach due to his sitting position in the table was exactly same as they were luck,which again a word that his Vultures love(all laugh)..he says the joy of pokemon was all he knew and did that's it.... totally driven by intuition...Ash Ketchum really needs me to survive here(all smile)\"\n..........\n[Gary enters 10 minutes later,and meets Lillie,Lillie hugs him suddenly]\nGary(bit surprized hugs Lillie) :

vultures do your work\"(all 3 laughs)\nMehadi(laugh,mocks Ash's stern look) : \"the vultures would insinuate that if they waited a bit more,a bit longer,a bit patiently,a bit meticulously..(all laugh again)..then it Could've been someone else,Could've been someone better, Could've been someone sweeter..(again all laugh)\"\nGary(laugh) : \"i get it.. Ash changed from trash to sweet..\"(all three sisters laugh uncontrollably)\nDaisy(laugh, immitating sigh) : \"alright,fine,they were always destined to each other..\"\nMehadi(laugh, immitating Ash's

come to each other whereas that itself is no good as the Gym is forever packed during shows(all brusts into laughter)..no don't try to leave,Dase,else Ganger will tickle you to death..(all brusts into laughter)..(again mocking Ash's anger) all those damn brats that ever had the audacity to challenge Gary's little sweet cherished flower to a gym battle at 4:17 in the morning with an Onix(all brusts into laughter)..must very well know it, understand it,digest it,swallow it, assimilate it(all again brusts into laughter)..that it's not then, it's not now,its not will be, it's not has been,had been,will be,not was,not is..(all again laughs)..but IT IS(all brusts into laughter)..it IS a fact that Gary and Lillie are the same thing appearing to each other as a bit different,bit distant,bit amusing,bit charming..(all again laugh)..but they are always EVER the same reality only appearing as different here thus they are in essence ever the same constant ONE(all smile)and no forsaken Vulture or  damn Cerulian Mob..(all brusts into laughter).. can EVER do anything about it(all laugh)...\"\nGary(laugh) : \"that's how the night passed then...(all brusts into

in this world and though they realize that actually Gary is also Lillie and Lillie is also Gary yet as they have this difference appearing before themselves through this world their relationship is thus best interpreted in a way which is that,that which here is appearing as Gary and that which here is appearing as Lillie may please answer the question whether they do want to be (smile)

happier about the same person in a matter of minutes(all smile).i still can't imagine how someone insults just about anyone to death and torments his beloved girlfriend to hell only to vividly direct her to jubilantly accept his proposal and then goes to fetch the ring overnight in a city in which he's the most cherished villian and gets mobbed while somehow managing to get the ring by forcing the mob down to utter confusion and on the way back to his fiancee rather takes a detour to nonchalantly come back to patch up with those whom he insulted to the absolute extreme just hours ago during their bedtime with such ultimate faith that nothing ever happened that he pulls a nasty prank on them in the end and then jovially goes back to make his proposal official,which takes place moments before in the deep night under the glare of the most incensed people that are his family or like family who wants to crush him into pieces out of resentment over his prolonged cruelty and rudeness,pulls off a lecture with the words giving a completely different impression to what he's trying to say,which is actually the most personal matter of his relationship with his fiancee,all this taking place via a conference call where his fiancee is present with him as well,calms his beraters down to such a degree that they can't help but to become most warm,frank and beloved to him as they'll remember the night forever as every time it'll give them an ultimate strength and joy- Ketchum,this alone should get you to the very top of Hall of Fame\"\n(all smile)\nAsh(blush) : \"um..thanks Daisy..it was..um..\"\nTracy(laughing) : \"but hours later by this very same man who laughed his whole night off, i had the fortune to be graced with the most inteicate epilogue(all laugh)so that no sinister words like BEST,PERFECT,FOREVER OR DESTINY(all brusts into laughter) can ever get their dirty hands to his perfectly attuned logic on how to differntiate a compliment from an insinuation (all laughs loudly) as he scared me to death by triggering a false alarm among his pokemons that forced Mrs Ketchum and Mime out of the kitchen(all laugh)so that all could come here today for lunch(all brusts into laughter) as he precisely inferred that his mom hadn't started preparing the lunch yet(all brusts into laughter) all the while his fiancee played along excuisitely well directed only through a momentary eye contact(all laugh,Mehadi blushs) and threatened to kill me by her Golduck(all laugh) that she was taking away from me(all brusts into laughter).Then this man beautifully proceeded along with our business(all laugh) all the while threatening me with his Gerninja all the time as he proudly roasted all unimaginable breed of different types of specieses of various Vultures (all brusts into laughter)\nonly to insinuate (all laugh) that he and all three of us the other guys should hold a ceremony right in the middle of the pool that's called the damn central battlefield (all laugh) in the gym,which never served his favourite dish for the guests(all laughs) and pick up our respective flowers(all laugh) right in front of all those Vultures (all laugh) and their Lackey the eternal Cerulian pests(all brusts into laughter) that ever thought what they're seeing is an illusion(all brusts into laughter)and then he concluded with the fact that if he's made the manager there,any dumbnut having the utter buffooness(all brusts into laughter) to come as a challenger anytime except 11-11:15 (all brusts into laughter) in the morning without 7 league titles and 31 Kanto badges(all laughs more) will be given a most precisely prepared eloquent class on rigourous vultureology of insinuation\"(all brusts into laughter and laughs for a long

Ash,i've hardly ever cried like i did yesterday and i've hardly ever cried like now i'm(all laugh)...and the way to say extremely personal things in this manner so that any unimaginable hellfire(all brusts into laughter) melts away in unimaginable fun and joy in no time...really Mehu,keep biting him every night\"\n(all brusts into laughter)\n.....\n...............\n(Night,Viridian Lake,After

longing for this moment itself justify our separation and heart wrenching feeling for each other?\nAsh(looking at Mehadi,cajoling Mehadi's head and cheeks and fondles her hairs) : \"absolutely Mehu,absolutely..but you know there's a possibility that your soulmate isn't born with you if one believes in multiple lives...and it gets even more difficult if you have only one life and even more difficult if there are many soulmates in human form...so at the end it really doesn't matter...\"\nMehadi(smile) : \"yup!if you have a soul that's your mate in itself..\"\nAsh(smile) : \"absolutely...but if you have one,you'll anyhow find out...so basically all you can do is to be brutally honest with yourself and just wait-it-out in fun\"\nMehadi(smile) : \"and you really have put

Reflection in The Elusive Boomerang,all un..,Cilan too un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..so then her love and affection if determined what she did she said Stashey will poke his tongue out and draw in back in like a snake exactly of 2 months(all un..)..so then she said i understood why Zed cautioned me that this was an opportunity rather than anything else as(laughing..) opportunity by definition is random unless sought after which doesn't require opportunity but actuality lexicon Hands-On(all un..)..so aunty said then i was thinking about my duty and all when these troubles only intensified and Stashey boy always kept his eyes closed but suddenly sometimes opened them up as much expanded as he could then instantly poked his tongue out as before aunty said this is mockery of devotion why need it if it's not there unless enforced exactly what i was attempted to meaning(laughing..) she said this idea came to me independently..A Random Repose(all un..long)..hence she said after sometimes i didn't really bother much no matter how much thickened the situations got cause it's like if you need something why you need is is why you need it..survival this a counter..Hands-On (all un..long)..then she said i started listening to great talks and practices and all by 3rd month yeah each day she said never seemed so long it's she said like 2 billion years of completely mutually exclusive lives i spent in those 2 months(all laugh..lot)..so she said then u started listening to great talks and all which Zed said must've been done in his absence so once i tried to check why the moment i started it suddenly he woke up and his whole body started moving around in a rhythm with as much as he could the gaze fixed but the tongue kept coming out sometimes but the whole thing was in a rhythm the moment i thought so it changed Zed said this is in reflection to teachings..JUST to be countering thus no movements in reflection..practice now Random(all un..long)..this means it's the demonstration of what's never there as said in the talks thus,\nOh my knowledge of random on self be mild mild/perfection look essence in STYLES STYLES(all un..long).. that's exactly why the direct hand combat stances caught their attention so much as the target was the brain the nectre of spontaneity the whole of physical survival psychology look emotions Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..and that's exactly what was shown then it's never a pattern as it's going to be caught so always people have to improvise there here all are automated anyway(all laugh..lot) as(laughing..) method look goal to path now Phantom(all un..long)..so after 3 months this brat anyway refused to stay there anymore as he refused to wake up for like 3 days which was like 300 years anyway(all burst..)..so then he was shifted Zed said the moment you're no more to I as said in those talks Guzzle Humdrum considers it to be a Humdrum of OF(all un..) thus Guzzles it by OFF(all un..)..so was shifted so aunty said i understood why they said it's an opportunity cause these sort of horrendously foolish creatures are indeed Elusive to(laughing..) accordance unless random(all un..long)..anyway then after this the random people were looking after them next 3 months then here and there it was total 7 months when they started to show physical consciousness and all in too much minuteness hence was kept among audio recordings and all as much as they could get in books and all on unbinding paths anything else were refused by sleeping for a day(all burst..)..so these went on for 5 long months and all then they started to talk and walk that is full speed running unless maximum capacity is reached never use a machine(all un..) then for 3 months their routine was they studied all sorts of lexicons and went on to pokemons for spontaneity when Guzzle Humdrum was bed ridden with fever who didn't speak at all(all laugh..lot) then finally after 3 months one day did speak then went away from home the very day said spontaneity no more random hence security can't be continuing but be present in fear and relief in-turn(all un..) then after that they stayed at Frucifern forest and all and also at Cerulean Valleys where by orientation abdicated disciples stayed with the indicted disciples meanings countered cause abdication means relief thus survival around it..Duality Hands-On(all un..)..anyway at the end of the day these all were taking place at 16 city ring of all places in the world the most infamous and notorious place in whole of Kanto second ranked in the world only Sadtomor-Sinverter-Karapaskar-Boomlurk ring from Kalos beats it just read the names for a change respectively associated with Hydreigon&Guzzlord,Regidrago&Ultranercozma,Giratina and Dragapult and finally Latias/Latios and Goodra of all brats with Drampas,Altarias,Rayquazas and Noiverns found everywhere in-between as preys(all laugh..lot)..when you see Rayquazas as preys you know you're not at a good place in your mind to start with and that's the end of it(all burst..)..well Cili knows it too well but that's a different sector of existence for later(all laugh..lot)..anyway so this was the second most notorious place from every standpoint the only saving grace is that pseudo-legends aren't found here but it's 16 cities and Pallet not 4 and 2 villages no matter they host Pastinoral and Pansetimal psychic cups with open valley battlefields(all laugh..lot)..so there was a huge concern as to what happens when master brats grasps those places too(all laugh..lot) 16 City except Juritared was all petrified by the prospect barring Frucifern and Pewter and Cerulean anyway matches the wealth of all the rest by 50% so never cared(all laugh..lot) and Cerulean Gym Leaders were the richest in the city cause they had shares everywhere our grandma and her sister and bro-in-law were very very shrewd business people mommy always said thankfully they never met Potent Pendulum rest unnecessary(all burst..,Daisy..Gamely In-Form,all un..)..no what can you do about someone named Gamely In-Form is completely beyond me still(all burst..)..anyway so at the Yellowburst Trials all really got us this was there chance Cladlie and Scarlie were undeterred still no matter what happened and they had no support except their bros and sisters here didn't like their act still no matter they defended them and kept them with them so they had no support barring those who were behind the bars now except Gladie they didn't make that mistake cause for all the things in the world the only thing those brats don't like is people messing around with our newborn baby at all rest assured(all laugh..lot)..courtrooms were ok provided Stu McShin and Marlee were with her anyway the only people who were neutral at 16 cities barring being immune to judiciary they themselves day one said Gladie is going to stay with them till abdicated(all laugh..lot) the WaterFires took this opportunity to viciously infight only(all burst..) but had they tried the prisons with Gladie it would've had very bad ramifications for the sanity of the outside world due to differences commitment look intention now Hologram(all un..long)..man they were so terrified by Daily Hologram there they said we never heard of anyone who invited people to his cell and visited others uninvited including the guards and

was a case he was the convict writing this reason he wrote back(laughing..) Mr Stash Ketchum as that was what was required to be present rest of society in equilibrium of desire and knowledge will find the solution themselves(all un..long)..so third time Police came to take him with him but he insisted on going to prison for a change cause they didn't provide foods during court sessions(all un..)..so at prison he was denied when he jumped on a police car in too much glee hence they had to detain him in terms of self declared Morality(all un..long)..then later they let him off obviously(all laugh..lot)..then he started for Saffron trials still going on all says he's a fugitive but he himself foiled their plans as he always asked everyone how to go to the city borders and so on thus trip to Saffron was validated as direction than destination Guzzle the Desirous Humdrum countering also while countering..just to be countering(all un..long)..then he reached Saffron and all in the meantime True Vaccine had the biggest misfortune to indict like,Ei..me me me me me me me/Ei..Focal Bludgeon whose your thee(all un..long,Aptly Opine,all un..)..so no progress was made like, hurry question's logic concur/else axiomatic soundness's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..but it was nothing like the very first day(all laugh..lot)..\n..(Recording Ole at Yellowburst Trials)..\nJudge(frown) : \"Mr Ole Ketchum welcom\"\nOle(thumping..) : \"Suruptisomonosatibom (all un..long)!..\nOh Ole look now i at the wheel/telling how good did you logically feel(all un..long)/Oh Ole look asking can you feel the rational chill(all un..long)/Mafaopile..intention to be Funteramlon you to me appeal(all un..long)..any questions invited most fervently and humbly as to on my place in your proprioception(all un..long)..so they realized this isn't going down well(all laugh..long)\"",

atleast(all burst..)..Guzzle Humdrum never needed food ofcourse only the meaning of hunger(all laugh..lot)..then after 3 weeks they weren't ok ofcourse so Zed employed Rita,Mava,Myla and Renee aunty with Zee to feed them in turns except for them they refused Zed himself but Guzzle Humdrum refused food still from everyone hence finally Zed now employed random people Guzzle Humdrum never objected afterwards only cause all else refused Rita aunty and all and also Zee now(all laugh..lot)..so so many varieties of people came but they seemed very happy in randomness finally(all laugh..lot)..this included Column Jargon dad said certainly you wouldn't have bothered about like whose your bro,Offshoot Trap(all un..),so he was spared looking at his disposition exactly similar to his beau and they were only so in paper we all understood there was absolutely 0 connection between them except the particular memory of the relationship(all laugh..lot)..but i was pampered to death by everyone as they

Jubilee Hands-On)..exactly why this mess has taken place in which i've been dragged into along with my involution this isn't at all humane(all laugh..lot)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"atleast we didn't say like relationship is the characteristics of potential Gary why do you want to know it(all un..,..DaisyDevil,..Daisy un..)..but even she isn't intruding like her hideous jackal who day one came here and didn't enter through the main gate cause the owner wasn't present there and no places were mentioned to inquire any help(all un..long)..this was the exact trap set up since day one here the day you find someone patiently waiting for you to not recognize him being attached to you you will know you've found the jackal of convenience obsessed with construction of observations(all un..) exactly why the involution never stepped a foot here before being oriented cause of obsession with characterizations of situations not they themselves as they don't exist in essential(all un..,..The Incorporated Ones,all un..,Tracey and Daisy too un..)..anyway then obviously because of all kinds of people looking after the babies all were concerned but Zed said don't bother they're only found in random(all un..,..Supporters,Advocates and Diplomats of The Opportunists of Hellfire,all un..)..exactly why(all laugh..lot)..but then at night they were inside which was vehemently opposed by all but they agreed again to be looked after by Jubilee Hands-On alone at night barring Guzzle Humdrum again(all laugh..lot)..who strangely agreed to be looked after by aunty for plane agnostic reasons obviously this was cause all offered to terminate all of them to which all resisted against but Zed told all to not say anything about Guzzle Humdrum cause if they terminate him before physical Consciousness at full he'll live here till others in abstract form which is what he wants so much to be at random(all laugh..lot)..and it's not recognizable at all unless one tries to(laughing..) understand something(all un..)..then because it's no more random Guzzle Humdrum points it out to them(all un..),i asked how this works much much later to Redzep Rafolrat(all laugh..lot),he said i don't know obviously physique if known alas to i oh you now Phantom(all un..long)..then i was training with the brats one day at Pasio right at the strike of midday call comes,yeah Redzie what's up,YO MAAN!(all un..long)..see how you knew me out of signal so random(all un..long),i said i see the moment you know the memory of i look Phantom(all un..long)..so anyway aunty vehemently objected to this the only person in the world who supported Guzzle Humdrum be brought in spatial existence all said this isn't going to end well for meaning of end of random(all un..)..so Guzzle Humdrum understood this in 2nd and third month when aunty looked after him no matter the varieties of difficulties of all sorts as Zed warned her from before never let your attention veer towards emptiness of reasoning this brat will Guzzle you up instantly for breaching the agreement of awareness of random so specific a Humdrum(all un..long)..thus he'll not stay in specifications at all only Guzzling the humdrum through you but now will take you as random hence will jump upon the humdrum cue..the most ensuing thus random(all un..long)..but ofcourse sometimes she did veer off anyone would no matter if they can defend barring Leading Crook and The Jackal of Subtlety for obvious reasons but if the Typicals of Elusive Dragon comes up then all of them will jump him anyway the Boomerang of self alas to only itself look help..the most engaging(all un..,Guang..Cili this a KOMMO-O,no sir he means once he showed how they evolve in emotions to have enough elasticity in perception not experience of it's sections,all un..,Gus.. Reflection in The Elusive Boomerang,all un..,Cilan too un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..so then her love and affection if determined what she did she said Stashey will poke his tongue out and draw in back in like a snake exactly of 2 months(all un..)..so then she said i understood why Zed cautioned me that this was an opportunity rather than anything else as(laughing..) opportunity by definition is random unless sought after which doesn't require opportunity but actuality lexicon Hands-On(all un..)..so aunty said then i was thinking about my duty and all when these troubles only intensified and Stashey boy always kept his eyes closed but suddenly sometimes opened them up as much expanded as he could then instantly poked his tongue out as before aunty said this is mockery of devotion why need it if it's not there unless enforced exactly what i was attempted to meaning(laughing..) she said this idea came to me independently..A Random Repose(all un..long)..hence she said after sometimes i didn't really bother much no matter how much thickened the situations got cause it's like if you need something why you need is is why you need it..survival this a counter..Hands-On (all un..long)..then she said i started listening to great talks and practices and all by 3rd month yeah each day she said never seemed so long it's she said like 2 billion years of completely mutually exclusive lives i spent in those 2 months(all laugh..lot)..so she said then u started listening to great talks and all which Zed said must've been done in his absence so once i tried to check why the moment i started it suddenly he woke up and his whole body started moving around in a rhythm with as much as he could the gaze fixed but the tongue kept coming out sometimes but the whole thing was in a rhythm the moment i thought so it changed Zed said this is in reflection to teachings..JUST to be countering thus no movements in reflection..practice now Random(all un..long)..this means it's the demonstration of what's never there as said in the talks thus,\nOh my knowledge of random on self be mild mild/perfection look essence in STYLES STYLES(all un..long).. that's exactly why the direct hand combat stances caught their attention so much as the target was the brain the nectre of spontaneity the whole of physical survival psychology look emotions Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..and that's exactly what was shown then it's never a pattern as it's going to be caught so always people have to improvise there here all are automated anyway(all laugh..lot) as(laughing..) method look goal to path now Phantom(all un..long)..so after 3 months this brat anyway refused to stay there anymore as he refused to wake up for like 3 days which was like 300 years anyway(all burst..)..so then he was shifted Zed said the moment you're no more to I as said in those talks Guzzle Humdrum considers it to be a Humdrum of OF(all un..) thus Guzzles it by OFF(all un..)..so was shifted so aunty said i understood why they said it's an opportunity cause these sort of horrendously foolish creatures are indeed Elusive to(laughing..) accordance unless random(all un..long)..anyway then after this the random people were looking after them next 3 months then here and there it was total 7 months when they started to show physical consciousness and all in too much minuteness hence was kept among audio recordings and all as much as they could get in books and all on unbinding paths anything else were refused by sleeping for a day(all burst..)..so these went on for 5 long months and all then they started to talk and walk that is full speed running unless maximum capacity is reached never use a machine(all un..) then for 3 months their routine was they studied all sorts of lexicons and went on to pokemons for spontaneity when Guzzle Humdrum was bed ridden with fever who didn't speak at all(all laugh..lot) then finally after 3 months one day did speak then went away from home the very day said spontaneity no more random hence security can't be continuing but be present in fear and relief in-turn(all un..) then after that they stayed at Frucifern forest and all and also at Cerulean Valleys where by orientation abdicated disciples stayed with the indicted disciples meanings countered cause abdication means relief thus survival around it..Duality Hands-On(all un..)..anyway at the end of the day these all were taking place at 20 city ring of all places in the world the most infamous and notorious place in whole of Kanto second ranked in the world only Sadtomor-Sinverter-Karapaskar-Boomlurk ring from Unova beats it just read the names for a change respectively associated with Hydreigon&Guzzlord,Regidrago&Ultranercozma,Giratina and Dragapult and finally Latias/Latios and Goodra of all brats with Drampas,Altarias,Rayquazas and Noiverns found everywhere in-between as preys(all laugh..lot)..when you see Rayquazas as preys you know you're not at a good place in your mind to start with and that's the end of it(all burst..)..well Cili knows it too well but that's a different sector of existence for later(all laugh..lot)..anyway so this was the second most notorious place from every standpoint the only saving grace is that pseudo-legends aren't found here but it's 20 cities and Pallet not 8 and 2 villages no matter they host Pastinoral and Pansetimal psychic cups with open valley battlefields(all laugh..lot)..or the fact that those 8 cities are both big and populated and most importantly rich as hell(all laugh..lot)..so there was a huge concern as to what happens when master brats grasps those places too(all laugh..lot) 19 City except Juritared was all petrified by the prospect barring Frucifern and Pewter and Cerulean anyway matches the wealth of all the rest by 10% so never cared(all laugh..lot) and Cerulean Gym Leaders were the richest in the city cause they had shares everywhere our grandma and her sister and bro-in-law were very very shrewd business people mommy always said thankfully they never met Potent Pendulum rest unnecessary(all burst..,Daisy..Gamely In-Form,all un..)..no what can you do about someone named Gamely In-Form is completely beyond me still(all burst..)..anyway so at the Yellowburst Trials all really got us this was there chance Cladlie and Scarlie were undeterred still no matter what happened and they had no support except their bros and sisters here didn't like their act still no matter they defended them and kept them with them so they had no support barring those who were behind the bars now except Gladie they didn't make that mistake cause for all the things in the world the only thing those brats don't like is people messing around with our newborn baby at all rest assured(all laugh..lot)..courtrooms were ok provided Stu McShin and Marlee were with her anyway the only people who were neutral at 16 cities barring being immune to judiciary they themselves day one said Gladie is going to stay with them till abdicated(all laugh..lot) the WaterFires took this opportunity to viciously infight only(all burst..) but had they tried the prisons with Gladie it would've had very bad ramifications for the sanity of the outside world due to differences commitment look intention now Hologram(all un..long)..man they were so terrified by Daily Hologram there they said we never heard of anyone who invited people to his cell and visited others uninvited including the guards and the main station turning it into a university intention look commitment now Hologram..specifications take a random counter(all un..long)..anyhow(all un..)..this all is barring Guzzle Humdrum though about not liking people disturbing Gladie with trifle stuffs like practicality not habituation(all burst..,..Gladly Syndrome) so Guzzle Humdrum was unperturbed amongst everything(all laugh..lot)..he knew the things they summoned him never went anyway unless paid the journey fare never left either unless similar terms morality Guzzle the honest humdrum(all un..)..this was same for all of them also the fact that they did some works where they went always prison and Huntelion Middle included ethics Hands-On(all un..)..anyway so they summoned Stashey second time they didn't pay the money cause it was a case he was the convict writing this reason he wrote back(laughing..) Mr Stash Ketchum as that was what was required to be present rest of society in equilibrium of desire and knowledge will find the solution themselves(all un..long)..so third time Police came to take him with him but he insisted on going to prison for a change cause they didn't provide foods during court sessions(all un..)..so at prison he was denied when he jumped on a police car in too much glee hence they had to detain him in terms of self declared Morality(all un..long)..then later they let him off obviously(all laugh..lot)..then he started for Saffron trials still going on all says he's a fugitive but he himself foiled their plans as he always asked everyone how to go to the city borders and so on thus trip to Saffron was validated as direction than destination Guzzle the Desirous Humdrum countering also while countering..just to be countering(all un..long)..then he reached Saffron and all in the meantime True Vaccine had the biggest misfortune to indict like,Ei..me me me me me me me/Ei..Focal Bludgeon whose your thee(all un..long,Aptly Opine,all un..)..so no progress was made like, hurry question's logic concur/else axiomatic soundness's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..but it was nothing like the very first day(all laugh..lot)..\n..(Recording Ole at Yellowburst Trials)..\nJudge(frown) : \"Mr Ole Ketchum welcom\"\nOle(thumping..) : \"Suruptisomonosatibom (all un..long)!..\nOh Ole look now i at the wheel/telling how good did you logically feel(all un..long)/Oh Ole look asking can you feel the rational chill(all un..long)/Mafaopile..intention to be Funteramlon you to me appeal(all un..long)..any questions invited most fervently and humbly as to on my place in your proprioception(all un..long)..so they realized this isn't going down well(all laugh..long)..but finally all hell broke lose when they summoned of all people Pubu Dislom(all burst..)..to annotate the movements and judge their correctness as that was the strongest direction to sue the master brats as discerned by like Jimmy Jimmy call to meaning Hologram(all un..long)..man he still says it's been 50 Years now you brats have thoroughly wasted this term for me enough with it(all laugh..lot)..we knew it won't go down well with how Pablo uncle was dealt with just took 7 years in making that's all(all laugh..lot)..and ofcourse we all knew TerryBilly and MillieDilly forever(all laugh..lot) but a sample like CammieSilly we didn't meet before Gissie is just a eversweet kid but CammieSilly is a sample of all times like Silly(all un..)..man what a month that was(all laugh..lot)..and True Vaccine picked up so many accolades for handling the situation properly will Fowldung being our chief opponent with Munu lad(all burst..)..then Davo son was there they were appointed since the Frucifern Crematorium Exams began and it took 11 long years for them through bush and hay to finally settle down after which debuted DoDo NotSoSure(all laugh..lot)..but it was nothing like MyOhHeadShook(all burst..)..firstly he had to bear the starting of Dashing Rock then DaisyDevil then The Adventurers of Lexicon(all un..long) then Viol flower then then Jubilee Hands-On then Who-oh-Forlorn(all un..) then if all of these weren't enough before he and his family could get off to Hoenn both his granddaughters were caught by how was the first day of school for your granddaughters,got married to Fortune Haps and yeah all are 3.5(all un..long,Guang and Itzel,Gus and Yagmur un..)..this was day 1 next day as the military was there came Guzzle Humdrum(all laugh..lot)..next day was Lastly Phantom then Daily Hologram then Simile Popcorn to end the week then Shadowy Lantern during weekends all were so despaired(all laugh..lot)..then throughout the month all the Master Brats came around in 4 weeks with the other 2 days one day The Feathered Ones debuted then the very last day of the month annotated rather than connotated disciples(all un..) debuted who were horrendous menaces to to any sort of analysis(all laugh..lot)..next month our 13 little brats debuted with Centy and Putu added who knew how to adulterate with procedural rules when they were 3.5 as much they knew how to inflicted recurrent riles upon themselves(all laugh..lot)..then this month featured the education of Guzzle Humdrum and the rest of the master brats,Guzzle Humdrum stayed for 1 week,rest 2,their interred disciples(all un..) 3 weeks and The Feathered Ones a whole month stayed that was all for Education(all laugh..lot)..Fortune Haps stayed for 2 months just to corroborate to their wives who insisted on going to school for some wired reasons(all burst..)..as Ibtuk was told yeah their names have been changed,i'll sue those..to Cassette Capture and Asset Future anything else they asked(all un..long,..Fortune Claps,all un..long)..man what sort of menaces these are who out of existence chose only ME as their primary target(all laugh..lot,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)..then Convene Skats also stayed at school for same time span then next month dad embodied into abstraction thankfully though for him i understood after the Team Plasma Sic chapter 7/8 months later(all laugh..lot)..The Great Boss still says they would feel relieved cause they were yet to meet horrendous menaces like Crawdauntogator yet TYRAniTAR he said we consciously stayed away from them whenever we had to use translators or any sort of signals(all laugh..lot)..then after Yellowburst trials the master brats unleashed with their sponsors and disciples as Weyo,Hemu,Doctor Slate and DaisyDevil finally went in Kanto in wilderness in the name of training requirements(all laugh..lot)..so all still settled but on the strike of 3rd week Juritared who were laughing at the rest 19 for 16 years by then suddenly found at their doorsteps Looking Vendor nothing else(all un..long)..like,\nSatiation's Tiffin Concur/Else self your expectation's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/oh being hurry reach conclusion don't again analyze render/Else look consciousness in relativity of certainty with absolute pedals ponder(all un..long)..Oh Looking Vendor/Hurry Hire or Bargain else satiation's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..man they said Juritared has the strongest security in whole of 20 city ring even better than Stonegarnet but with this all automated machines revolted against their algorithmic progress to metaphysical digress(all burst..)..but finally 5 days after this came Cross Arm Defence(all burst..)",

delivered due to his limitations entailing thought entailing despair as it's said not due to his skills entailing analysis entailing construction as if countered it's a completely different world as they said determination : the spin of lexicon(all un..long)..then Ms Sonrisa and Solaria Dazmatas were promoted only in their first region now in second they're only promoted by Ebonypitch branch of Dr Oak's lab(all laugh..lot)..and Mr Kulinak have retired already as he said so yeah may be a good idea but i have a different stream of exploration here i'll talk about it in moments(all burst..) but does he have any current customers cause Sonrisa and Solaria has been off for 2 years now and Mr Kulinak wasn't in this profession anyway(all laugh..lot)\"\nMay(bit excited) : \"oh yeah he has a lots of customers to start with he has Mr Redzep Rafolrat Mr Humberto Rafolrat's son he's Kalos Head Radzie i spoke wth is a general trainer Kanto and Kalos winner shared with Ms Krystal Kinrel for first 2 leagues now at Sinnoh..(giggle)..his title is no association imputed(all un..long)..(giggle)..like Mr Hummm-Bertoooo-'Nough on Stat(both un..)..(all un..long)..then he has Mr Barry Winston his title

Johto his title is..(giggle)..Oh my Pulu Pencil be mild on nil/as that is just another on how do i feel(all un..long)..he's been added the newest then there's Ms Olivia Ombigaf a psychic specialist

Ja-him-no-Kentimak(all un..) they too i spoke with are like so young you know epistemologically Seth said so delicious the food hence only registered(all burst..)..then there's Mr Terrence Bistorter

yeah after Mr Skechit was unveiled as Mr Tracey-the Jackal-Sketches-It(all un..long,Drew and May..Tracey-Looking-Most-Sly-Fox,all un..long,Tracey shakes..)..we were in final sem of our qualification then so a question came i remember what it actually asked that was to describe the neutrality of THE in sense vs mood(all un..long)..so it comes down to neutrality vs specificity in usage of witness so i said it's evident in this question as Mrs Fressia Waterflower Ketchum propounded this scheme,Oh Mr Sketches It doing it from cue but tell us why cue never While doing(all un..long)/thus jumping into ocean of variety with categorically unattached but deductively uncharged Marill witness will be ruing(all un..long,Tracey too un..)..\nbut strangely the examiners said why Marill isn't replaced by faculties we don't know what does Marill specifically mean(all un..long,Tracey too un..long)..so then i recalled that song by Ms Volbeat at Cerulean itself on this issue of observational functionality not operability(all un..)..so it was that,\nAs look managing of difference is opining never tuning(all un..long)/jumping into specialization of characters with Icy Cold determination Yet in Psychic integral with it in properties being an Icy cold though Psychic Dewgong will be ruing(all un..long,..Daisy un..long)..then again they repeated the question on why i'm not saying faculties but using recurring named entities to point out to the difference of understanding thus orientation of same faculties as perceptive not incisive(all un..)..ao at this i said well it's the unsolved questions as to why one likes a particular thing most only if it satiates the need of survival like a gender to start from(all burst..)..then they said there's no reasoning attached to these named entities at all only the invitation for penetration which only gives a recurrence to the meaning(all burst..)..so i said exactly the neutralizing feeling the specific healing the most entertaining never possible to give only enact in self that boomerang to the elusive centre of choice not need of any dealing(all un..long,..Service of The Elusiveüêâ,Cilan shakes..)..then they liked this answer i don't know why after i said choice is elusive to need(all un..) but anyway this is what i felt about humanity you know the witness of the engineering crew,engineering the meaning of you(all

Drew they know the podcast of generality you know not the questioner of assurance(all un..long)..hence he said they don't impute essence at all thus like as Lillie says cloud of specifity doesn't specify only personalize necessity(all un..,..Lillie flower)..so it's way clearer he said now as to why he wants to do something rather than what he has to do(all un..)..so yeah definitely he'll get in i have a different stream of thoughts which is why i'll discuss it with them\"\nMay(happy) : \"yeah and thus drop this attention to it in my presence immediately else biases will be formed due to

does he have any current customers cause Sonrisa and Solaria has been off for 2 years now and Mr Kulinak wasn't in this profession anyway(all laugh..lot)\"\nMay(bit excited) : \"oh yeah he has a lots

Johto his title is..(giggle)..Oh my Pulu Pencil be mild on nil/as that is just another on how do i feel(all un..long)..he's been added the newest then there's Ms Olivia Ombigaf a psychic specialist and Mr Jaheem Kentimak a bug/fly specialist they are travel companions and childhood friends they are in the ranks too Olivia's title is Oh-Living-via-Ombigaf(all un..) and Jaheem is Ja-him-no-Kentimak(all un..) they too i spoke with are like so young you know epistemologically Seth said so delicious the food hence only registered(all burst..)..then there's Mr Terrence Bistorter and Mrs Mildred Dislom Bistorter you know them whole world does the only ones with whom A Random Tryrantum behaved properly due to much love and affection as they were in a tough situation and he knew them since babyhood(all burst..) they are called TerryBilly and MillieDilly together The Inverted Ones(all burst..) and Terry is a fire specialist,Millie is a poison specialist Terry was very wise and

not refusal they just don't understand what's humanity(all laugh..lot)..(giggle)..but what do you know about it(all un..long,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May too un..long)\"\nDrew(thoughtful) : \"oh yeah after Mr Skechit was unveiled as Mr Tracey-the Jackal-Sketches-It(all un..long,Drew and May..Tracey-Looking-Most-Sly-Fox,all un..long,Tracey shakes..)..we were in final sem of our qualification then so a question came i remember what it actually asked that was to describe the neutrality of THE in sense vs mood(all un..long)..so it comes down to neutrality vs specificity in usage of witness so i said it's evident in this question as Mrs Fressia Waterflower Ketchum propounded this scheme,Oh Mr Sketches It doing it from cue but tell us why cue never While doing(all un..long)/thus jumping into ocean of variety with categorically unattached but deductively uncharged Marill witness will be ruing(all un..long,Tracey too un..)..\nbut strangely the examiners said why Marill isn't replaced by faculties we don't know what does Marill specifically mean(all un..long,Tracey too un..long)..so then i recalled that song by Ms Volbeat at Cerulean itself on this issue of observational functionality not operability(all un..)..so it was that,\nAs look managing of difference is opining never tuning(all un..long)/jumping into specialization of characters with Icy Cold determination Yet in Psychic integral with it in properties being an Icy cold though Psychic Dewgong will be ruing(all un..long,..Daisy un..long)..then again they repeated the question on why i'm not saying faculties but using recurring named entities to point out to the difference of understanding thus orientation of same faculties as perceptive not incisive(all un..)..ao at this i said well it's the unsolved questions as to why one likes a particular thing most only if it satiates the need of survival like a gender to start from(all burst..)..then they said there's no reasoning attached to these named entities at all only the invitation for penetration which only gives a recurrence to the meaning(all burst..)..so i said exactly the neutralizing feeling the specific healing the most entertaining never possible to give only enact in self that boomerang to the elusive centre of choice not need of any dealing(all un..long,..Service of The Elusiveüêâ,Cilan shakes..)..then they liked this answer i don't know why after i said choice is elusive to need(all un..) but anyway this is what i felt about humanity you know the witness of the engineering crew,engineering the meaning of you(all un..)\"\nMay(bit thoughtful) : \"um..yeah like if asked who then the question is asking why to stop the process itself in the name of any meaning that may be dew exactly what is asked about the reflection of anything that's you(all un.. long)..but(giggle)..this also reminds me of the other sort of promotions he did but before that he has 3 vacancies now actually so would Tony come too..\"\nDrew(happy) : \"oh yeah Tony will get in too even if i don't no trouble(all un..,..Tony Boy)\"\nMay(excited) : \"oh yeah most certainly Cuo spoke in a great length about his presentation faculties of heuristics to what he's presenting as to why he is doing what he's doing rather than merely describing IT(all un..long,..Curly Mention,all un..long)\"\nDrew(happy) : \"yeah and he said no Drew they know the podcast of generality you know not the questioner of assurance(all un..long)..hence he said they don't impute essence at all thus like as Lillie says cloud of specifity doesn't specify only personalize necessity(all un..,..Lillie flower)..so it's way clearer he said now as to why he wants to do something rather than what he has to do(all un..)..so yeah definitely he'll get in i have a different stream of thoughts which is why i'll discuss it with them\"\nMay(happy) : \"yeah and thus drop this attention to it in my presence immediately else biases will be formed due to my decision (all un..,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May un..)\"\nDrew(thoughtful) : \"yeah indeed but does he require all of his clients to know each other and also past and present\"\nMay(thoughtful) : \"well may be cause Snorie and Slirrie were complaining to Gungie that Barry were disturbing them with denomination of unknown in algebra vs encapsulation of known in any criteria(all un..),so yeah probably\"\nDrew(bit thoughtful) : \"well then there might be a trouble cause Tony said after his last cup that he met someone who he couldn't know only consolidate as oh(all un..long)..\"\nMay(very happy) : \"was it Namburek cup that you said he wants to do cause Stashey said Oliv is too impatient to let the Police finish their introduction of their location(all un..long)\"\nDrew(happy) : \"oh then it's very easy for him to get in in terms of defences of loh! i'll tell him(all un..long)..but um..Mr Jaheem,Mr Paul and Mr Barry are they free from questions of vectorial not nominal monitoring(all un..long)\"\nMay(thoughtful) : \"um..no Barry's other half Winona i met too an electric specialist she even looks way younger to Max in terms of definition of conviction and cessation(all burst..) about Jaheem he was rejected by someone about which he complains that he followed the customs perfectly as to ask properly for a date the first time he wanted to go alone which was rejected instantly hence he said next time i'm going straight to registration office only if Alone(all un..long)..and that's Flavia who also speaks with Gungie,Gus,Cuo and bro all time cause she's the versioning criterion of Mr Harris's other half Brenda who bro said doesn't understand the kinds of automations of respect thus fell into the trap of happiness thinking to further inspect(all un..long)..then there's a great recording about this Harris son ofcourse was in the courses of study itself(all un..,Cilan and Jennifer..Viri Ri Ri Zion Zi Zi On Viri Ri Zi On/Call me Groundon or oh now gone to personality of chance the professional mention,all un..long,Seth..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long)..anyway Flavia bro said complained that Jaheem mentioned where he wants to go before saying the word date and he wanted to go to the nearest training facility to see a few matches to celebrate the occasion but Flav said this is unfair to the idea of dating as personal correspondence not objective hindrances(all un..long,..The Brochure Ones,all un..)..so she also said next time she's only coming out if not alone from registration office(all un..long,..The Manual Ones,all un..long)..and yeah they have contacts still all the time and says these themselves all time if this topic comes up among like siblings they just don't contact each other real time or facetime(all un..long,..The Monitoring Ones,all un..)..they met during an University fest on ground type pokemonsk(all burst..,..Dashing Leading Rock,Brock un..)..so yeah that's the reason why he's in but Pulu i don't know they didn't say(all laugh..lot) so yeah this is the reason Redzie ofcourse were like Mr Litman but he refused to promote single persons due to this infatuation with ideology(all burst..) hence came here(all burst..,Iris..no Mrs Rarcia don't drink that water so quickly else it only reveals your inability to attend to the issue enough and your needs not enough dually in both ways my Raboot didn't understand this you know hence took 2 more battles to evolve,all un..long,Iris..Marc The Mr Litman..no further singular issues involved..countering,all un..)..and that is also because Stashey knew him like forever as i said(all laugh..lot,Guang&Cuong..Mr Hummm-Bertoooo 'Nough-of-Stat,all un..)..anyway but there are a few recordings on these..\"\nDrew(bit excited) : \"yeah Tony said nighttime trainings waking them up suddenly as we ourselves will then talking about memory loss and lack of physical harmony yeah i'll see this(all un..,..Tony Boy)..anyway welcome then at deduction(all un..long)\"\nMay(smile) : \"yeah on nominations indeed(all un..long,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May un..)\"\n..(Recording Randy Tantrum with Cameron inside his home compound after they

it(all un..long,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May too un..long)\"\nDrew(thoughtful) : \"oh yeah after Mr Skechit was unveiled as Mr Tracey-the Jackal-Sketches-It(all un..long,Drew and May..Tracey-Looking-Most-Sly-Fox,all un..long,Tracey shakes..)..we were in final sem of our qualification then so a question came i remember what it actually asked that was to describe the neutrality of THE in sense vs mood(all un..long)..so it comes down to neutrality vs specificity in usage of witness so i said it's evident in this question as Mrs Fressia Waterflower Ketchum propounded this scheme,Oh Mr Sketches It doing it from cue but tell us why cue never While doing(all un..long)/thus jumping into ocean of variety with categorically unattached but deductively uncharged Marill witness will be ruing(all un..long,Tracey too un..)..\nbut strangely the examiners said why Marill isn't replaced by faculties we don't know what does Marill specifically mean(all un..long,Tracey too un..long)..so then i recalled that song by Ms Volbeat at Cerulean itself on this issue of observational functionality not operability(all un..)..so it was that,\nAs look managing of difference is opining never tuning(all un..long)/jumping into specialization of characters with Icy Cold determination Yet in Psychic integral with it in properties being an Icy cold though Psychic Dewgong will be ruing(all un..long,..Daisy un..long)..then again they repeated the question on why i'm not saying faculties but using recurring named entities to point out to the difference of understanding thus orientation of same faculties as perceptive not incisive(all un..)..ao at this i said well it's the unsolved questions as to why one likes a particular thing most only if it satiates the need of survival like a gender to start from(all burst..)..then they said there's no reasoning attached to these named entities at all only the invitation for penetration which only gives a recurrence to the meaning(all burst..)..so i said exactly the neutralizing feeling the specific healing the most entertaining never possible to give only enact in self that boomerang to the elusive centre of choice not need of any dealing(all un..long,..Service of The Elusiveüêâ,Cilan shakes..)..then they liked this answer i don't know why after i said choice is elusive to need(all un..) but anyway this is what i felt about humanity you know the witness of the engineering crew,engineering the meaning of you(all un..)\"\nMay(bit thoughtful) : \"um..yeah like if asked who then the question is asking why to stop the process itself in the name of any meaning that may be dew exactly what is asked about the reflection of anything that's you(all un.. long)..but(giggle)..this also reminds me of the other sort of promotions he did but before that he has 3 vacancies now actually so would Tony come too..\"\nDrew(happy) : \"oh yeah Tony will get in too even if i don't no trouble(all un..,..Tony Boy)\"\nMay(excited) : \"oh yeah most certainly Cuo spoke in a great length about his presentation faculties of heuristics to what he's presenting as to why he is doing what he's doing rather than merely describing IT(all un..long,..Curly Mention,all un..long)\"\nDrew(happy) : \"yeah and he said no Drew they know the podcast of generality you know not the questioner of assurance(all un..long)..hence he said they don't impute essence at all thus like as Lillie says cloud of specifity doesn't specify only personalize necessity(all un..,..Lillie flower)..so it's way clearer he said now as to why he wants to do something rather than what he has to do(all un..)..so yeah definitely he'll get in i have a different stream of thoughts which is why i'll discuss it with them\"\nMay(happy) : \"yeah and thus drop this attention to it in my presence immediately else biases will be formed due to my decision (all un..,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May un..)\"\nDrew(thoughtful) : \"yeah indeed but does he require all of his clients to know each other and also past and present\"\nMay(thoughtful) : \"well may be cause Snorie and Slirrie were complaining to Gungie that Barry were disturbing them with denomination of unknown in algebra vs encapsulation of known in any criteria(all un..),so yeah probably\"\nDrew(bit thoughtful) : \"well then there might be a trouble cause Tony said after his last cup that he met someone who he couldn't know only consolidate as oh(all un..long)..\"\nMay(very happy) : \"was it Namburek cup that you said he wants to do cause Stashey said Oliv is too impatient to let the Police finish their introduction of their location(all un..long)\"\nDrew(happy) : \"oh then it's very easy for him to get in in terms of defences of loh! i'll tell him(all un..long)..but um..Mr Jaheem,Mr Paul and Mr Barry are they free from questions of vectorial not nominal monitoring(all un..long)\"\nMay(thoughtful) : \"um..no Barry's other half Winona i met too an electric specialist she even looks way younger to Max in terms of definition of conviction and cessation(all burst..) about Jaheem he was rejected by someone about which he complains that he followed the customs perfectly as to ask properly for a date the first time he wanted to go alone which was rejected instantly hence he said next time i'm going straight to registration office only if Alone(all un..long)..and that's Flavia who also speaks with Gungie,Gus,Cuo and bro all time cause she's the versioning criterion of Mr Harris's other half Brenda who bro said doesn't understand the kinds of automations of respect thus fell into the trap of happiness thinking to further inspect(all un..long)..then there's a great recording about this Harris son ofcourse was in the courses of study itself(all un..,Cilan and Jennifer..Viri Ri Ri Zion Zi Zi On Viri Ri Zi On/Call me Groundon or oh now gone to personality of chance the professional mention,all un..long,Seth..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long)..anyway Flavia bro said complained that Jaheem mentioned where he wants to go before saying the word date and he wanted to go to the nearest training facility to see a few matches to celebrate the occasion but Flav said this is unfair to the idea of dating as personal correspondence not objective hindrances(all un..long,..The Brochure Ones,all un..)..so she also said next time she's only coming out if not alone from registration office(all un..long,..The Manual Ones,all un..long)..and yeah they have contacts still all the time and says these themselves all time if this topic comes up among like siblings they just don't contact each other real time or facetime(all un..long,..The Monitoring Ones,all un..)..they met during an University fest on ground type pokemonsk(all burst..,..Dashing Leading Rock,Brock un..)..so yeah that's the reason why he's in but Pulu i don't know they didn't say(all laugh..lot) so yeah this is the reason Redzie ofcourse were like Mr Litman but he refused to promote single persons due to this infatuation with ideology(all burst..) hence came here(all burst..,Iris..no Mrs Rarcia don't drink that water so quickly else it only reveals your inability to attend to the issue enough and your needs not enough dually in both ways my Raboot didn't understand this you know hence took 2 more battles to evolve,all un..long,Iris..Marc The Mr Litman..no further singular issues involved..countering,all un..)..and that is also because Stashey knew him like forever as i said(all laugh..lot,Guang&Cuong..Mr Hummm-Bertoooo 'Nough-of-Stat,all un..)..anyway but there are a few recordings on these..\"\nDrew(bit excited) : \"yeah Tony said nighttime trainings waking them up suddenly as we ourselves will then talking about memory loss and lack of physical harmony yeah i'll see this(all un..,..Tony Boy)..anyway welcome then at deduction(all un..long)\"\nMay(smile) : \"yeah on

    "body": "Gary(laughing..) : \"well after everything unfolded about the Ketchums grandma said whole world was ridiculing us too to add to the sanctions(all laugh..lot)..but she said we would've been out of service but Weyo,Hemu,Zed and Hui and Wiji who were like 3 months when first came(all laugh..lot)..and from their very appearances you could say they were enjoying this situation so much(all laugh..lot)..someone approached Zed on the moral grounds finally after Zee returned from hospital he said distribution : the icon of nature..the most essential..countering potential..Hands-On(all un..long)..i asked Blithie once that what was your take on this situation after hearing it first said so surprised oh it's the dedication of anagram in reflection infinity encapsulated by monogram why(all un..long,..Mr Slicing Price,all un..long)..i knew once Tyranitars asked how to rather than why to why that the end was neigh(all un..long,..Colony Monogram,all un..long,Seth and Mehadi too un..long)..cause that menace lastly was trained by ghastly Phantom to deal with things making situation now Phantom(all un..long)..and we saw him since day one Zed cautioned us from day zero never to mingle with him cause he's completely devoid of any kind of solution as question look reason now Phantom(all un..long,Daisy..Lastly The Playboy Junction)..Guzzle Humdrum was approachable atleast(all laugh..lot)..and Dawnny was to be trained by Shadowy Lantern but she was too sweet for the horrendous methods of self effacement hence walked the path of Lastly Phantom where all has to come in elation of disappointment solution look predicate now Phantom(all un..)..thankfully Drew and May,Max,Iris,Bonnie,Clem,Sirich,Dave and Serrie especially stayed away from this terrible creature of effects result to expectation look Phantom countering the degree oriented mathematical Humdrum(all un..)..he never responded to anyone barring his versioning adversaries and contemporaries not even to his followers Seth and Inu themselves did everything(all laugh..lot) his sponsors didn't bother about him neither did Cili and all(all laugh..lot)..but strangely DaisyDevil jumped him day one after he turned 1.5 she 10.5(all laugh..lot) that's another chapter of life(all laugh..lot,Daisy..Ash don't try to explain why these magazines are important ok,all un..,Magazine : The Engine of Variety..look away goes necessity..pondering,all un..long,Daisy.. Lastly The Playboy Section,all un..)..anyway this brat responded obviously mostly to Guzzle Humdrum which Niji did the least among them cause she was just elder to Guzzle Humdrum hence had some affection for him too rest only meaning(all un..long)..and the reverse was the same thus they always looked after each other in the forest rest never bothered(all laugh..lot)..and this Zed said is always the case cause the rest are obsessive even Humdrum not corrective like Ashey boy that's another completely different chapter of Reflective Corrections of counters..present now Phantom(all un..long)..so this menace was only understood by his own versions and especially the adversaries and specifically Niji which was reciprocated perfectly cause none went anywhere near Shadowy Lantern,Anchor Arcane,Office Answer and Bounty Bedlam at all(all laugh..lot)..but Ashey boy didn't have any patterns in behaviour Humdrum was a rogue we all knew but Ashey boy had so many characters in his arsenal he never needed anything exactly why Zed said he was found each time in such cases and each time behaved as he's doing now(all laugh..lot)..Weather Chat and Critical Pat are exotic creatures among them he said(all laugh..lot) unlike Simile Popcorn though Zed said like Ash Lixue was the same too much glee rather than appropriation(all laugh..lot)..then this was same for Kuchi and Orrie in their group rest were exotic like that in sequence obviously Coffin Saunter the most like hurry self being's Tiffin Concur/else ego's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/Practice look Looking Vendor(all burst..)/Desire hurry pedal ponder(all un..long,..Coffin  Saunter,all un..long)..else look habit and counter both says their Coffin Saunter(all un..long,..Looking Vendor,all un..long)..but that's as much as like,Allez Allez Allez/any one is same look thus automatically Allez Allez Allez(all un..long)/Able Section Thus/Effort Fractions shine on action's ray(all un..long)..Premise Allez Allez Allez/Ordain Allez Allez Allez(all un..long)/Allez Allez Allez/Look just but Allez Allez Allez(all un..long,..Premise Ordain,all un..long)..Torrie aunty said i've no idea who introduced this menace to stadium cheers(all un..long,Able Section Thus Oh Effort Fraction,all un..long)..but Zed said tell me whose the only one that's esoteric among them i said obviously anyone who says at 1 year 4 months the very first one,Ei me me me me me me me me/Ei Focal Bludgeon how to be(all un..long,Focal Bludgeon,all un..long)/me me me me see see see see/alas look now me goes me me me me(all un..long)/Ei be be be be be be be be/Ei Aptly Opine how to thee(all un..long,..Aptly Opine,all un..long)..Kelly aunty said i don't know which rascal from the school dungeon told him to use music while practicing planks(all un..)..but Ashey boy didn't speak much at all barring their discussions which was completely nonsensical(all laugh..lot)..there too only if Niji spoke he spoke but Lixue,Pillie,Ojo and Ushi always spoke hence Raki,Orrie,Pongie and Khum too always spoke but never the reverse(all laugh..lot)..rest  Niji,Kuchi,Omu and Liro never spoke hence only Ossie,Nihu and Kibu never spoke but never the reverse(all laugh..lot)..but Ashey boy anyway didn't speak Humdrum only remained silent till Niji talked(all laugh..lot) so when they had to Niji always dealt with Stashey boy who disturbed her always in discussions on how it helped him hence his freedom to fail was being muzzled(all un..long)..and then when Guzzle Humdrum remained silent Niji always showed up not randomly but whenever it was time for eating which was methodical in forest the time not the food(all un..long,..Master Brats,all un..long).. exactly why(all un..) anyway hence this always irritated humdrum as his right to be absent was being nuzzled(all un..long)..but when Ashey boy was around for discussion Niji always became too vicious(all laugh..lot)..this was cause Zed said other times Ashey boy entertains her this time because Guzzle Humdrum is here he's irritating her right to determination(all un..,..Shadowy Lantern,all un..long)..anyway once i had the horrendous misfortune of having to host Lastly Phantom at a dining table(all burst..)..none told him anything ever neither would he listen to either(all laugh..lot) this was barring Guzzle Humdrum strangely(all un..)..who only listened to Doctor Slate who only listened to Zed who only listened to Delia,Kelly and Torrie aunty thus they managed Lastly Phantom(all laugh..lot)..rest listened to only Viol flower(all burst..)..who was completely unstable unless Zed was there thus they were managed(all laugh..lot)..anyway thus once this was the month before my first sem started the only all due to these two heinous Feathered brats(all laugh..lot)\"\nGenkai+Blossom(laughing..) : \"today we will..hush(all un..long)..have grammar inhaled the possible smoke(all un..long)/of present causality thus say that this is this..as in Dr Oak(all un..long)\"\nDaisy&Violet : \"that what you know is this..no no no no no..personal stroke(all un..long)/say professionally by logic they are thus as in Mr in professional many if plural thus impersonal any thus no more personality in being Oak(all un..long,..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"atleast we completed a semester properly(all burst..)..anyway this was the month before my first sem so i was there Zed told me to ENJOY the experience(all burst..)..so first of all Ashey boy walks in the security still asked for identity the reply is I-den tee-tea(all un..long)..anything else(all un..long) no..look gone thus Oh..countering(all un..long,Daisy..Lastly The Playboy Section,all un..long)..then gets in Myla aunty still tried to mingle with him,Ash haven't seen you so many days honey,have-not(all un..long)..any questions left(all un..long)..no away goes the haste recapturing(all un..long)..now i was following him and was thinking what sort of a menace is this Raki isn't lonely atleast no matter his decoy of cynicism(all laugh..lot)..next in Odell uncle..hey Ash,A-shh(all un..long).. anything else on grammar to say(all un..long)..no language look goes..accepting(all un..long),next up Justin uncle,don't think you've become an overnight sensation of unboundedness ok,do-not(all un..long) any answers expected(all un..long) desire look going past what's by it just been..inspected(all un..long),next up finally Kelly,Torrie and Delia aunty,Ash sit down,Do-Own(all un..long)..any measurements expected(all un..long)..no intention look goes..convinced(all un..long)..but after all these in the dining whole world was in there i hardly did fit and all were so happy for some reason what could only seem.. expectation look by conviction in self logic now Phantom..countering(all un..long)..then finally after this he sees Zed who doesn't say anything then he says one word..Edge(all un..long) any reality constructed(all un..long)..no devotion look goes..satiated(all un..long)..to this Zed only says,practice(all un..long)..now i understood why he told me to enjoy this cause now i'll be completely usurped by this hideous pro of melancholy(all burst..)..so now he asks me service of tactics(all un..long),i said tactics hence he sat down that is he asked does he have to do or let BE done(all un..long),now Zed said never serve well cooked meals on an invitation to him he'll completely ransack your compassion(all un..long,..Lastly Phantom,all un..long)..anyway it was the main dining whole lab was there almost excluding Zee,Margin and Gladie who had to manage the rest as all left their places(all laugh..lot) so with this scene there's this dining table and chair and all this brat sits on the floor in that short space left(all laugh..lot),i look at Zed he has just zapped out obviously for better than good degrees now Phantom(all un..),so I'm left to figure out Lastly Phantom all on my own so i ask him would you like it if the table is moved away,a-way(all un..)..anything else..no..look desire goes away..neglecting(all un..),i didn't understand if i was taught properly to use a language(all un..),so i couldn't do anything thus said,um..ok i'm serving you here's your plate,p-late# anything else..no..look to bind need quench away goes..timely#,and he doesn't take it so i put it in front of him and understood the terrible mistake of asking him to let it be rather than to be just it#,anyway then i put the plate in front and first up serve some pasta and sauce but he doesn't

minutes goes by so i now ask won't you eat,e-at#anything else..no..look away goes reality..from wherever it is..virtually#now there's some clamour outside as to few destitute people followed Lastly Phantom all the way now they're getting in finally Zed had allowed them just in time#so they come in none said a word for some reason and made way#now there's all them in the room expect me and then they ask hey Ash what's up#,hh-Ei#..anything else..no..look away goes instruction..practically#,now i was in such a precarious situation as to how much could we serve cause they were 10 adult men all works in the fields and all they could eat like Tyranitars anyway#,anyway then they are giggling and all looking like 5 year olds and asks me#,bro how do you cook what do you then think how you resolve the difference between me and see#i looked at Phantom now standing up with the plate and is proceeding to feed these people as if i was a stand up comedian and they were enjoying popcorn of literal simile#Reticence Vat#..\"\nSeth : \"oh now look beings..hunger just poke#looking though points away..thus just Dr Oak#Oh see now beings..personal smoke#thus look now at self..professional

document that through pondering over moments rather than existence and thus only they try to connect customisation of determination with functionalization of connotations rather than announcement of

but how were you moral,ethical and Honest,Oh-nest#..anything else..no..look away goes preset..determined#,then he leaves again i was so happy#,but Rita aunty who wasn't there now comes in and learns all and then makes the terrible mistake to ask Lastly Phantom that,your name is still in the property owner's books what about that,'n-Aim#.. anything else..no..look away goes correspondence..towards the goal..efficiently#..then he leaves and all then Zed zaps in at our presence at the gate and tells me how was the experience Gary,i said this namecall is going to be a millenial problem for society it's a long long road down attempts for atleast next 50 generations#..Zed says,a-tempt#..anything else..no..look does away go innocence..unperturbed#,i asked what if i asked him for service,would've done the same then cooked the same meal for you if didn't know how to cook then would've forced you too by..cue-ok#,i said yeah away goes action..redundant#,then i asked him so he made action

out only the name for this brat only one was discerned then and he has ruined it for himself not us though don't you think so#,i said he told you himself A-shh#,away goes language accepting grammar has already been substracted# then finally Margin comes in,Ei Gary what did he do to habits#,so i viciously jumped him#..Mr According Tithe.._,so#,then finally i understood why Hui,Wiji,Gladie and Zee never bothers about him#,but anyway after this mess Leah aunty strangely asks me hey Gary why don't you check out wheather they have eaten at all or not Centy wants to go at the forest once why don't you take him tonight Kuchi told me once it's WONDERFUL#,i said and that menace is called Verily Verbatim#,anyway then i myself went shoving the little brat down Zee's throat then i went there at night where none could go at night alone anyway unless it was their followers and compeers-of-arms and all but i'm always irritated by them hence i step my foot out cross the Gumnum Park and 2 baby Rowlets with their mommy Rowlet as usual follows me#,so they pestered me whole way then went off before the cursed point of entry at Frucifern-Quaquaversal-Cerulean neutral#so then i just enter the lands and

Lastly The Playboy Section,all un..)..anyway this brat responded obviously mostly to Guzzle Humdrum which Niji did the least among them cause she was just elder to Guzzle Humdrum hence had some affection for him too rest only meaning(all un..long)..and the reverse was the same thus they always looked after each other in the forest rest never bothered(all laugh..lot)..and this Zed said is always the case cause the rest are obsessive even Humdrum not corrective like Ashey boy that's another completely different chapter of Reflective Corrections of counters..present now Phantom(all un..long)..so this menace was only understood by his own versions and especially the adversaries and specifically Niji which was reciprocated perfectly cause none went anywhere near Shadowy Lantern,Anchor Arcane,Office Answer and Bounty Bedlam at all(all laugh..lot)..but Ashey boy didn't have any patterns in behaviour Humdrum was a rogue we all knew but Ashey boy had so many characters in his arsenal he never needed anything exactly why Zed said he was found each time in such cases and each time behaved as he's doing now(all laugh..lot)..Weather Chat and Critical Pat are exotic creatures among them he said(all laugh..lot) unlike Simile Popcorn though Zed said like Ash Lixue was the same too much glee rather than appropriation(all laugh..lot)..then this was same for Kuchi and Orrie in their group rest were exotic like that in sequence obviously Coffin Saunter the most like hurry self being's Tiffin Concur/else ego's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/Practice look Looking Vendor(all burst..)/Desire hurry pedal ponder(all un..long,..Coffin  Saunter,all un..long)..else look habit and counter both says their Coffin Saunter(all un..long,..Looking Vendor,all un..long)..but that's as much as like,Allez Allez Allez/any one is same look thus automatically Allez Allez Allez(all un..long)/Able Section Thus/Effort Fractions shine on action's ray(all un..long)..Premise Allez Allez Allez/Ordain Allez Allez Allez(all un..long)/Allez Allez Allez/Look just but Allez Allez Allez(all un..long,..Premise Ordain,all un..long)..Torrie aunty said i've no idea who introduced this menace to stadium cheers(all un..long,Able Section Thus Oh Effort Fraction,all un..long)..but Zed said tell me whose the only one that's esoteric among them i said obviously anyone who says at 1 year 4 months the very first one,Ei me me me me me me me me/Ei Focal Bludgeon how to be(all un..long,Focal Bludgeon,all un..long)/me me me me see see see see/alas look now me goes me me me me(all un..long)/Ei be be be be be be be be/Ei Aptly Opine how to thee(all un..long,..Aptly Opine,all un..long)..Kelly aunty said i don't know which rascal from the school dungeon told him to use music while practicing planks(all un..)..but Ashey boy didn't speak much at all barring their discussions which was completely nonsensical(all laugh..lot)..there too only if Niji spoke he spoke but Lixue,Pillie,Ojo and Ushi always spoke hence Raki,Orrie,Pongie and Khum too always spoke but never the reverse(all laugh..lot)..rest  Niji,Kuchi,Omu and Liro never spoke hence only Ossie,Nihu and Kibu never spoke but never the reverse(all laugh..lot)..but Ashey boy anyway didn't speak Humdrum only remained silent till Niji talked(all laugh..lot) so when they had to Niji always dealt with Stashey boy who disturbed her always in discussions on how it helped him hence his freedom to fail was being muzzled(all un..long)..and then when Guzzle Humdrum remained silent Niji always showed up not randomly but whenever it was time for eating which was methodical in forest the time not the food(all un..long,..Master Brats,all un..long).. exactly why(all un..) anyway hence this always irritated humdrum as his right to be absent was being nuzzled(all un..long)..but when Ashey boy was around for discussion Niji always became too vicious(all laugh..lot)..this was cause Zed said other times Ashey boy entertains her this time because Guzzle Humdrum is here he's irritating her right to determination(all un..,..Shadowy Lantern,all un..long)..anyway once i had the horrendous misfortune of having to host Lastly Phantom at a dining table(all burst..)..none told him anything ever neither would he listen to either(all laugh..lot) this was barring Guzzle Humdrum strangely(all un..)..who only listened to Doctor Slate who only listened to Zed who only listened to Delia,Kelly and Torrie aunty thus they managed Lastly Phantom(all laugh..lot)..rest listened to only Viol flower(all burst..)..who was completely unstable unless Zed was there thus they were managed(all laugh..lot)..anyway thus once this was the month before my first sem started the only all due to these two heinous Feathered brats(all laugh..lot)\"\nGenkai+Blossom(laughing..) : \"today we will..hush(all un..long)..have grammar inhaled the possible smoke(all un..long)/of present causality thus say that this is this..as in Dr Oak(all un..long)\"\nDaisy&Violet : \"that what you know is this..no no no no no..personal stroke(all un..long)/say professionally by logic they are thus as in Mr in professional many if plural thus impersonal any thus no more personality in being Oak(all un..long,..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"atleast we completed a semester properly(all burst..)..anyway this was the month before my first sem so i was there Zed told me to ENJOY the experience(all burst..)..so first of all Ashey boy walks in the security still asked for identity the reply is I-den tee-tea(all un..long)..anything else(all un..long) no..look gone thus Oh..countering(all un..long,Daisy..Lastly The Playboy Section,all un..long)..then gets in Myla aunty still tried to mingle with him,Ash haven't seen you so many days honey,have-not(all un..long)..any questions left(all un..long)..no away goes the haste recapturing(all un..long)..now i was following him and was thinking what sort of a menace is this Raki isn't lonely atleast no matter his decoy of cynicism(all laugh..lot)..next in Odell uncle..hey Ash,A-shh(all un..long).. anything else on grammar to say(all un..long)..no language look goes..accepting(all un..long),next up Justin uncle,don't think you've become an overnight sensation of unboundedness ok,do-not(all un..long) any answers expected(all un..long) desire look going past what's by it just been..inspected(all un..long),next up finally Kelly,Torrie and Delia aunty,Ash sit down,Do-Own(all un..long)..any measurements expected(all un..long)..no intention look goes..convinced(all un..long)..but after all these in the dining whole world was in there i hardly did fit and all were so happy for some reason what could only seem.. expectation look by conviction in self logic now Phantom..countering(all un..long)..then finally after this he sees Zed who doesn't say anything then he says one word..Edge(all un..long) any reality constructed(all un..long)..no devotion look goes..satiated(all un..long)..to this Zed only says,practice(all un..long)..now i understood why he told me to enjoy this cause now i'll be completely usurped by this hideous pro of melancholy(all burst..)..so now he asks me service of tactics(all un..long),i said tactics hence he sat down that is he asked does he have to do or let BE done(all un..long),now Zed said never serve well cooked meals on an invitation to him he'll completely ransack your compassion(all un..long,..Lastly Phantom,all un..long)..anyway it was the main dining whole lab was there almost excluding Zee,Margin and Gladie who had to manage the rest as all left their places(all laugh..lot) so with this scene there's this dining table and chair and all this brat sits on the floor in that short space left(all laugh..lot),i look at Zed he has just zapped out obviously for better than good degrees now Phantom(all un..),so I'm left to figure out Lastly Phantom all on my own so i ask him would you like it if the table is moved away,a-way(all un..)..anything else..no..look desire goes away..neglecting(all un..),i didn't understand if i was taught properly to use a language(all un..),so i couldn't do anything thus said,um..ok i'm serving you here's your plate,p-late# anything else..no..look to bind need quench away goes..timely#,and he doesn't take it so i put it in front of him and understood the terrible mistake of asking him to let it be rather than to be just it#,anyway then i put the plate in front and first up serve some pasta and sauce but he doesn't say how much is enough#now i thought um..what if he asks me to feed him#so anyway i gave what i thought was enough now he doesn't eat ofcourse#keeps looking at the food was sitting cross legged thus 5 minutes goes by so i now ask won't you eat,e-at#anything else..no..look away goes reality..from wherever it is..virtually#now there's some clamour outside as to few destitute people followed Lastly Phantom all the way now they're getting in finally Zed had allowed them just in time#so they come in none said a word for some reason and made way#now there's all them in the room expect me and then they ask hey Ash what's up#,hh-Ei#..anything else..no..look away goes instruction..practically#,now i was in such a precarious situation as to how much could we serve cause they were 10 adult men all

back in like a snake exactly of 2 months(all un..)..so then she said i understood why Zed cautioned me that this was an opportunity rather than anything else as(laughing..) opportunity by definition is random unless sought after which doesn't require opportunity but actuality lexicon Hands-On(all un..)..so aunty said then i was thinking about my duty and all when these troubles only intensified and Stashey boy always kept his eyes closed but suddenly sometimes opened them up as much expanded as he could then instantly poked his tongue out as before aunty said this is mockery of devotion why need it if it's not there unless enforced exactly what i was attempted to meaning(laughing..) she said this idea came to me independently..A Random Repose(all un..long)..hence she said after sometimes i didn't really bother much no matter how much thickened the situations got cause it's like if you need something why you need is is why you need it..survival this a counter..Hands-On (all un..long)..then she said i started listening to great talks and practices and all by 3rd month yeah each day she said never seemed so long it's she said like 2 billion years of completely mutually exclusive lives i spent in those 2 months(all laugh..lot)..so she said then u started listening to great talks and all which Zed said must've been done in his absence so once i tried to check why the moment i started it suddenly he woke up and his whole body started moving around in a rhythm with as much as he could the gaze fixed but the tongue kept coming out sometimes but the whole thing was in a rhythm the moment i thought so it changed Zed said this is in reflection to teachings..JUST to be countering thus no movements in reflection..practice now Random(all un..long)..this means it's the demonstration of what's never there as said in the talks thus,\nOh my knowledge of random on self be mild mild/perfection look essence in STYLES STYLES(all un..long).. that's exactly why the direct hand combat stances caught their attention so much as the target was the brain the nectre of spontaneity the whole of physical survival psychology look emotions Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..and that's exactly what was shown then it's never a pattern as it's going to be caught so always people have to improvise there here all are automated anyway(all laugh..lot) as(laughing..) method look goal to path now Phantom(all un..long)..so after 3 months this brat anyway refused to stay there anymore as he refused to wake up for like 3 days which was like 300 years anyway(all burst..)..so then he was shifted Zed said the moment you're no more to I as said in those talks Guzzle Humdrum considers it to be a Humdrum of OF(all un..) thus Guzzles it by OFF(all un..)..so was shifted so aunty said i understood why they said it's an opportunity cause these sort of horrendously foolish creatures are indeed Elusive to(laughing..) accordance unless random(all un..long)..anyway then after this the random people were looking after them next 3 months then here and there it was total 7 months when they started to show physical consciousness and all in too much minuteness hence was kept among audio recordings and all as much as they could get in books and all on unbinding paths anything else were refused by sleeping for a day(all burst..)..so these went on for 5 long months and all then they started to talk and walk that is full speed running unless maximum capacity is reached never use a machine(all un..) then for 3 months their routine was they studied all sorts of lexicons and went on to pokemons for spontaneity when Guzzle Humdrum was bed ridden with fever who didn't speak at all(all laugh..lot) then finally after 3 months one day did speak then went away from home the very day said spontaneity no more random hence security can't be continuing but be present in fear and relief in-turn(all un..) then after that they stayed at Frucifern forest and all and also at Cerulean Valleys where by orientation abdicated disciples stayed with the indicted disciples meanings countered cause abdication means relief thus survival around it..Duality Hands-On(all un..)..anyway at the end of the day these all were taking place at 20 city ring of all places in the world the most infamous and notorious place in whole of Kanto second ranked in the world only Sadtomor-Sinverter-Karapaskar-Boomlurk ring from Unova beats it just read the names for a change respectively associated with Hydreigon&Guzzlord,Regidrago&Ultranercozma,Giratina and Dragapult and finally Latias/Latios and Goodra of all brats with Drampas,Altarias,Rayquazas and Noiverns found everywhere in-between as preys(all laugh..lot)..when you see Rayquazas as preys you know you're not at a good place in your mind to start with and that's the end of it(all burst..)..well Cili knows it too well but that's a different sector of existence for later(all laugh..lot)..anyway so this was the second most notorious place from every standpoint the only saving grace is that pseudo-legends aren't found here but it's 20 cities and Pallet not 8 and 2 villages no matter they host Pastinoral and Pansetimal psychic cups with open valley battlefields(all laugh..lot)..or the fact that those 8 cities are both big and populated and most importantly rich as hell(all laugh..lot)..so there was a huge concern as to what happens when master brats grasps those places too(all laugh..lot) 19 City except Juritared was all petrified by the prospect barring Frucifern and Pewter and Cerulean anyway matches the wealth of all the rest by 10% so never cared(all laugh..lot) and Cerulean Gym Leaders were the richest in the city cause they had shares everywhere our grandma and her sister and bro-in-law were very very shrewd business people mommy always said thankfully they never met Potent Pendulum rest unnecessary(all burst..,Daisy..Gamely In-Form,all un..)..no what can you do about someone named Gamely In-Form is completely beyond me still(all burst..)..anyway so at the Yellowburst Trials all really got us this was there chance Cladlie and Scarlie were undeterred still no matter what happened and they had no support except their bros and sisters here didn't like their act still no matter they defended them and kept them with them so they had no support barring those who were behind the bars now except Gladie they didn't make that mistake cause for all the things in the world the only thing those brats don't like is people messing around with our newborn baby at all rest assured(all laugh..lot)..courtrooms were ok provided Stu McShin and Marlee were with her anyway the only people who were neutral at 16 cities barring being immune to judiciary they themselves day one said Gladie is going to stay with them till abdicated(all laugh..lot) the WaterFires took this opportunity to viciously infight only(all burst..) but had they tried the prisons with Gladie it would've had very bad ramifications for the sanity of the outside world due to differences commitment look intention now Hologram(all un..long)..man they were so terrified by Daily Hologram there they said we never heard of anyone who invited people to his cell and visited others uninvited including the guards and the main station turning it into a university intention look commitment now Hologram..specifications take a random counter(all un..long)..anyhow(all un..)..this all is barring Guzzle Humdrum though about not liking people disturbing Gladie with trifle stuffs like practicality not habituation(all burst..,..Gladly Syndrome) so Guzzle Humdrum was unperturbed amongst everything(all laugh..lot)..he knew the things they summoned him never went anyway unless paid the journey fare never left either unless similar terms morality Guzzle the honest humdrum(all un..)..this was same for all of them also the fact that they did some works where they went always prison and Huntelion Middle included ethics Hands-On(all un..)..anyway so they summoned Stashey second time they didn't pay the money cause it was a case he was the convict writing this reason he wrote back(laughing..) Mr Stash Ketchum as that was what was required to be present rest of society in equilibrium of desire and knowledge will find the solution themselves(all un..long)..so third time Police came to take him with him but he insisted on going to prison for a change cause they didn't provide foods during court sessions(all un..)..so at prison he was denied when he jumped on a police car in too much glee hence they had to detain him in terms of self declared Morality(all un..long)..then later they let him off obviously(all laugh..lot)..then he started for Saffron trials still going on all says he's a fugitive but he himself foiled their plans as he always asked everyone how to go to the city borders and so on thus trip to Saffron was validated as direction than destination Guzzle the Desirous Humdrum countering also while countering..just to be countering(all un..long)..then he reached Saffron and all in the meantime True Vaccine had the biggest misfortune to indict like,Ei..me me me me me me me/Ei..Focal Bludgeon whose your thee(all un..long,Aptly Opine,all un..)..so no progress was made like, hurry question's logic concur/else axiomatic soundness's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..but it was nothing like the very first day(all laugh..lot)..\n..(Recording Ole at Yellowburst Trials)..\nJudge(frown) : \"Mr Ole Ketchum welcom\"\nOle(thumping..) : \"Suruptisomonosatibom (all un..long)!..\nOh Ole look now i at the wheel/telling how good did you logically feel(all un..long)/Oh Ole look asking can you feel the rational chill(all un..long)/Mafaopile..intention to be Funteramlon you to me appeal(all un..long)..any questions invited most fervently and humbly as to on my place in your proprioception(all un..long)..so they realized this isn't going down well(all laugh..long)..but finally all hell broke lose when they summoned of all people Pubu Dislom(all burst..)..to annotate the movements and judge their correctness as that was the strongest direction to sue the master brats as discerned by like Jimmy Jimmy call to meaning Hologram(all un..long)..man he still says it's been 50 Years now you brats have thoroughly wasted this term for me enough with it(all laugh..lot)..we knew it won't go down well with how Pablo uncle was dealt with just took 7 years in making that's all(all laugh..lot)..and ofcourse we all knew TerryBilly and MillieDilly forever(all laugh..lot) but a sample like CammieSilly we didn't meet before Gissie is just a eversweet kid but CammieSilly is a sample of all times like Silly(all un..)..man what a month that was(all laugh..lot)..and True Vaccine picked up so many accolades for handling the situation properly will Fowldung being our chief opponent with Munu lad(all burst..)..then Davo son was there they were appointed since the Frucifern Crematorium Exams began and it took 11 long years for them through bush and hay to finally settle down after which debuted DoDo NotSoSure(all laugh..lot)..but it was nothing like MyOhHeadShook(all burst..)..firstly he had to bear the starting of Dashing Rock then DaisyDevil then The Adventurers of Lexicon(all un..long) then Viol flower then then Jubilee Hands-On then Who-oh-Forlorn(all un..) then if all of these weren't enough before he and his family could get off to Hoenn both his granddaughters were caught by how was the first day of school for your granddaughters,got married to Fortune Haps and yeah all are 3.5(all un..long,Guang and Itzel,Gus and Yagmur un..)..this was day 1 next day as the military was there came Guzzle Humdrum(all laugh..lot)..next day was Lastly Phantom then Daily Hologram then Simile Popcorn to end the week then Shadowy Lantern during weekends all were so despaired(all laugh..lot)..then throughout the month all the Master Brats came around in 4 weeks with the other 2 days one day The Feathered Ones debuted then the very last day of the month annotated rather than connotated disciples(all un..) debuted who were horrendous menaces to to any sort of analysis(all laugh..lot)..next month our 13 little brats debuted with Centy and Putu added who knew how to adulterate with procedural rules when they were 3.5 as much they knew how to inflicted recurrent riles upon themselves(all laugh..lot)..then this month featured the education of Guzzle Humdrum and the rest of the master brats,Guzzle Humdrum stayed for 1 week,rest 2,their interred disciples(all un..) 3 weeks and The Feathered Ones a whole month stayed that was all for Education(all laugh..lot)..Fortune Haps stayed for 2 months just to corroborate to their wives who insisted on going to school for some wired reasons(all burst..)..as Ibtuk was told yeah their names have been changed,i'll sue those..to Cassette Capture and Asset Future anything else they asked(all un..long,..Fortune Claps,all un..long)..man what sort of menaces these are who out of existence chose only ME as their primary target(all laugh..lot,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)..then Convene Skats also stayed at school for same time span then next month dad embodied into abstraction thankfully though for him i understood after the Team Plasma Sic chapter 7/8 months later(all laugh..lot)..The Great Boss still says they would feel relieved cause they were yet to meet horrendous menaces like Crawdauntogator yet TYRAniTAR he said we consciously stayed away from them whenever we had to use translators or any sort of signals(all laugh..lot)..then after Yellowburst trials the master brats unleashed with their sponsors and disciples as Weyo,Hemu,Doctor Slate and DaisyDevil finally went in Kanto in wilderness in the name of training requirements(all laugh..lot)..so all still settled but on the strike of 3rd week Juritared who were laughing at the rest 19 for 16 years by then suddenly found at their doorsteps Looking Vendor nothing else(all un..long)..like,\nSatiation's Tiffin Concur/Else self your expectation's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/oh being hurry reach conclusion don't again analyze render/Else look consciousness in relativity of certainty with absolute pedals ponder(all un..long)..Oh Looking Vendor/Hurry Hire or Bargain else satiation's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..man they said Juritared has the strongest security in whole of 20 city ring even better than Stonegarnet but with this all automated machines revolted against their algorithmic progress to metaphysical digress(all burst..)..but finally 5 days after this came Cross Arm Defence(all burst..)..all were suspicious as to what Coffin Saunter and Lastly Phantom was going to do so Juritared anyway was on red alert but none goes to the gym valley anyway(all laugh..lot)..man after that it was an absolute mess there(all laugh..lot)..",

    "body": "Gary(laughing..) : \"then aunty said i asked Zed that whose gonna feed all of these 38 Zed it's like 7 families that too like The Cerulean gym leaders at maximum stretch he said first of all it's 40 then 4 of your nephews and nieces makes it 4 more to 44 then there's your eldest daughter then your son-of-arm(all un..) total 46 infact uncle and aunty only will look after Gary and 46 is 16 of the original brats 16 their quoted disciples 4 reminded ones(all un..) the sponsorship is always done and corroborated as financial markets extoll co-operatives always financial institutions peer-to-peer authority of objection else it's committee not authority as objectives come only hands-on(all un..long)..then there's the 4 of their colleagues then the 2 their sympathisers(all laugh..lot) then comes 1 their appetizer that's for a starter you know your elder daughter without meaning sentience so semantical(all un..) thus she's in this hence came(all un..,..Jolly On-Roam,all un..) then there's the WaterFires each of them so total 22(all laugh..lot)..and all of them barring two beings are followers of Doctor Slate no matter their orientation unless forwarded or proper(all laugh..lot) then there's the two other beings out of which one is Doctor Slate's compeer-or-never of as he feels his-arms(all un..long) thus one is extremely subtle not easily available to pun(all burst..) the other whose involution follows Doctor Slate completely blindly and refuses to admit that in involution there's more to feeling the Elusive meaning(all laugh..lot, Jennifer bursts..,Cilan shakes..)..this being mom holds the key to stability of the last one that's Guzzle Humdrum else this brat wouldn't have come this being mom is discerned always at last when the Humdrum of Pass comes to Guzzle the nuzzle of thus(all un..long)..this is the Elusive Boomerang of us mom can you find it in HUSH can you live without it in slash but can you ever typify it in duality as just(all un..long)..Welcome the ODE as i said before to Theüêâ of the Elusive Counter of Last(all un..long,Guang,Gus,Cuong&Seth..The Elusiveüêâ,all un..,Cilan too un..)..\"\nGuang&Gus(laughing..lot) : \"Oh üêâ üêâ this an insignificant attempt to describe thy dear/that's the untamed meaning of any thing if fair(all un..long)/no sir no mam they meant your contribution in their lives reflecting so well(all un..long)/as they remember what they did to let ego in own self quell(all un..long,..The Boomerang of Last,all un..,Cilan shakes..)..\"\nCilan(laughing..) : \"no i was the most insignificant guy you know doing my journeys thinking of making a nice peaceful calm quiet tranquil home exactly as Justin uncle and Delia aunty thought(all laugh..lot) but suddenly these brats appear of the blue/in all smiles with their 130 horribly headless crew(all laugh..lot)/they grasped the Elite4 saying if they seemed to them no it's only you(all un..long)/suddenly at exact midnight call comes can you tell the time indeed you're true(all un..long)..these brats spoil my life always(all laugh..lot)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"no the only thing that could surpass the introduction to jackal was the Boomerang of Last 12 years later had to be Unova and had to be Tyranitar the most elusive rock(all laugh..lot)..and the first had to be Noivern pairs as in the thoughts(all burst..)..anyway to aunty's apprehension over how to nourish all these brats and they were 39 and one more so 40 at a time Zed says on the question of food and who will serve that the reply is(laughing..), situations(all un..long,..Society,all un..), causally called self(all un..)..survival Hands-On..thus no need of help(all un..long,..Society,all un..)..look at attachment mom you're alas no more left only is so remote this self..logic thus invites applications from reflection Hands-On..any further requirements(all un..long,..Civilization,all un..)..then when we arrived master brats downright refused food from the beginning (all laugh..lot)..their uninterrupted disciples(all un..) followed suit then their 2 patrons will not take more than one sip in the milk or one morsel of food the impinged ones(all un..) refused more than two obviously (all un..long)..but Guzzle Humdrum refused water as well rest of the others of his compeer-of-arms and the interrupted disciples(all un..long) took 1 sip atleast(all burst..)..Guzzle Humdrum never needed food ofcourse only the meaning of hunger(all laugh..lot)..then after 3 weeks they weren't ok ofcourse so Zed employed Rita,Mava,Myla and Renee aunty with Zee to feed them in turns except for them they refused Zed himself but Guzzle Humdrum refused food still from everyone hence finally Zed now employed random people Guzzle Humdrum never objected afterwards only cause all else refused Rita aunty and all and also Zee now(all laugh..lot)..so so many varieties of people came but they seemed very happy in randomness finally(all laugh..lot)..this included Column Jargon dad said certainly you wouldn't have bothered about like whose your bro,Offshoot Trap(all un..),so he was spared looking at his disposition exactly similar to his beau and they were only so in paper we all understood there was absolutely 0 connection between them except the particular memory of the relationship(all laugh..lot)..but i was pampered to death by everyone as they couldn't get their hands on master brats and their entourage and all thier sponsors and this is Hands-On deceit how they foisted everyone upon my nerves literally since DAY ZERO mingling only ME in their self inflicted mess(all laugh..lot)..\"\nGladys&Zee : \"Come here baby..hush(all un..long)..did potential on your theories exhale it's logical smoke(all un..long)\"\nDaisy&Violet : \"here honey..no no no no no..that's personality spoke(all un..long)\"\nGladys&Zee&Daisy&Violet : \"hence write down the profession of Dr in Mrs Oak(all burst..,..The Professional Oak Halves)\"\nLillie(laughing..) : \"atleast we didn't say like here take this food it will help you..shut up you namecall(all un..long) THEY(all un..) are far better at vagueness of decision than your namecall's(all un..long) consolation of perception take that you namecall(all un..long,..Breezy Flower Dream,all un..)..\"\nPoppy&Mehadi : \"well it was so cause while we were fed it was said like, personally/mind rally/experience/look observing now though professionally(all un..long,..Lillie flower,all un..)..\"\nWeayaya(laughing..) : \"hallow baby we're going to check you today no it won't

un..long)..\"\nDaisy(laughing..) : \"come now oh dear..you mean intellectual band(all un..long)\nas i know this but oh look now later(all un..long)..why not let feelings in interpretation's hand(all un..long,..The Unfolded Ones,all un..,Brock and Violet too un..)\"\nHaithem : \"wake up honey..you mean perceptual metaphor(all un..long)\nWhat is..is the character of a management bully..knowing

un..long)\"\nGladys(laughing..) : \"jackal jackal..\njackal jackal comes always slow(all un..long)/as that's jackal of detached observations as to meaning of destination space lets own ego go(all un..long)/jackal jackal look now writing something/never looking around as that's the ü¶ä of something(all un..long)..\"\nSeth(laughing..) : \"jackal looks down on the earth/beware duality you're mind the meaning ON the map(all un..long,..un..Mehadi as does Mehadi un..Seth,Tracey too un..)\"\nCuong(laughing..) : \"oh Frontier of cue and you/look jackal gives commentaries on how to you(all un..long,un..Poppy who also un..Cuong)\"\nPoppy&Mehadi(fits..) : \"jackal jackal says oh looking server/are you detached from the obvious fervour(all un..long)/jackal jackal points out

Jubilee Hands-On)..exactly why this mess has taken place in which i've been dragged into along with my involution this isn't at all humane(all laugh..lot)\"\nGary(laughing..) : \"atleast we didn't say like relationship is the characteristics of potential Gary why do you want to know it(all un..,..DaisyDevil,..Daisy un..)..but even she isn't intruding like her hideous jackal who day one came here and didn't enter through the main gate cause the owner wasn't present there and no places were mentioned to inquire any help(all un..long)..this was the exact trap set up since day one here the day you find someone patiently waiting for you to not recognize him being attached to you you will know you've found the jackal of convenience obsessed with construction of observations(all un..) exactly why the involution never stepped a foot here before being oriented cause of obsession with characterizations of situations not they themselves as they don't exist in essential(all un..,..The Incorporated Ones,all un..,Tracey and Daisy too un..)..anyway then obviously because of all kinds of people looking after the babies all were concerned but Zed said don't bother they're only found in random(all un..,..Supporters,Advocates and Diplomats of The Opportunists of Hellfire,all un..)..exactly why(all laugh..lot)..but then at night they were inside which was vehemently opposed by all but they agreed again to be looked after by Jubilee Hands-On alone at night barring Guzzle Humdrum again(all laugh..lot)..who strangely agreed to be looked after by aunty for plane agnostic reasons obviously this was cause all offered to terminate all of them to which all resisted against but Zed told all to not say anything about Guzzle Humdrum cause if they terminate him before physical Consciousness at full he'll live here till others in abstract form which is what he wants so much to be at random(all laugh..lot)..and it's not recognizable at all unless one tries to(laughing..) understand something(all un..)..then because it's no more random Guzzle Humdrum points it out to them(all un..),i asked how this works much much later to Redzep Rafolrat(all laugh..lot),he said i don't know obviously physique if known alas to i oh you now Phantom(all un..long)..then i was training with the brats one day at Pasio right at the strike of midday call comes,yeah Redzie what's up,YO MAAN!(all un..long)..see how you knew me out of signal so random(all un..long),i said i see the moment you know the memory of i look Phantom(all un..long)..so anyway aunty vehemently objected to this the only person in the world who supported Guzzle Humdrum be brought in spatial existence all said this isn't going to end well for meaning of end of random(all un..)..so Guzzle Humdrum understood this in 2nd and third month when aunty looked after him no matter the varieties of difficulties of all sorts as Zed warned her from before never let your attention veer towards emptiness of reasoning this brat will Guzzle you up instantly for breaching the agreement of awareness of random so specific a Humdrum(all un..long)..thus he'll not stay in specifications at all only Guzzling the humdrum through you but now will take you as random hence will jump upon the humdrum cue..the most ensuing thus random(all un..long)..but ofcourse sometimes she did veer off anyone would no matter if they can defend barring Leading Crook and The Jackal of Subtlety for obvious reasons but if the Typicals of Elusive Dragon comes up then all of them will jump him anyway the Boomerang of self alas to only itself look help..the most engaging(all un..,Guang..Cili this a KOMMO-O,no sir he means once he showed how they evolve in emotions to have enough elasticity in perception not experience of it's sections,all un..,Gus.. Reflection in The Elusive Boomerang,all un..,Cilan too un..)..anyway(all laugh..lot)..so then her love and affection if determined what she did she said Stashey will poke his tongue out and draw in back in like a snake exactly of 2 months(all un..)..so then she said i understood why Zed cautioned me that this was an opportunity rather than anything else as(laughing..) opportunity by definition is random unless sought after which doesn't require opportunity but actuality lexicon Hands-On(all un..)..so aunty said then i was thinking about my duty and all when these troubles only intensified and Stashey boy always kept his eyes closed but suddenly sometimes opened them up as much expanded as he could then instantly poked his tongue out as before aunty said this is mockery of devotion why need it if it's not there unless enforced exactly what i was attempted to meaning(laughing..) she said this idea came to me independently..A Random Repose(all un..long)..hence she said after sometimes i didn't really bother much no matter how much thickened the situations got cause it's like if you need something why you need is is why you need it..survival this a counter..Hands-On (all un..long)..then she said i started listening to great talks and practices and all by 3rd month yeah each day she said never seemed so long it's she said like 2 billion years of completely mutually exclusive lives i spent in those 2 months(all laugh..lot)..so she said then u started listening to great talks and all which Zed said must've been done in his absence so once i tried to check why the moment i started it suddenly he woke up and his whole body started moving around in a rhythm with as much as he could the gaze fixed but the tongue kept coming out sometimes but the whole thing was in a rhythm the moment i thought so it changed Zed said this is in reflection to teachings..JUST to be countering thus no movements in reflection..practice now Random(all un..long)..this means it's the demonstration of what's never there as said in the talks thus,\nOh my knowledge of random on self be mild mild/perfection look essence in STYLES STYLES(all un..long).. that's exactly why the direct hand combat stances caught their attention so much as the target was the brain the nectre of spontaneity the whole of physical survival psychology look emotions Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..and that's exactly what was shown then it's never a pattern as it's going to be caught so always people have to improvise there here all are automated anyway(all laugh..lot) as(laughing..) method look goal to path now Phantom(all un..long)..so after 3 months this brat anyway refused to stay there anymore as he refused to wake up for like 3 days which was like 300 years anyway(all burst..)..so then he was shifted Zed said the moment you're no more to I as said in those talks Guzzle Humdrum considers it to be a Humdrum of OF(all un..) thus Guzzles it by OFF(all un..)..so was shifted so aunty said i understood why they said it's an opportunity cause these sort of horrendously foolish creatures are indeed Elusive to(laughing..) accordance unless random(all un..long)..anyway then after this the random people were looking after them next 3 months then here and there it was total 7 months when they started to show physical consciousness and all in too much minuteness hence was kept among audio recordings and all as much as they could get in books and all on unbinding paths anything else were refused by sleeping for a day(all burst..)..so these went on for 5 long months and all then they started to talk and walk that is full speed running unless maximum capacity is reached never use a machine(all un..) then for 3 months their routine was they studied all sorts of lexicons and went on to pokemons for spontaneity when Guzzle Humdrum was bed ridden with fever who didn't speak at all(all laugh..lot) then finally after 3 months one day did speak then went away from home the very day said spontaneity no more random hence security can't be continuing but be present in fear and relief in-turn(all un..) then after that they stayed at Frucifern forest and all and also at Cerulean Valleys where by orientation abdicated disciples stayed with the indicted disciples meanings countered cause abdication means relief thus survival around it..Duality Hands-On(all un..)..anyway at the end of the day these all were taking place at 20 city ring of all places in the world the most infamous and notorious place in whole of Kanto second ranked in the world only Sadtomor-Sinverter-Karapaskar-Boomlurk ring from Unova beats it just read the names for a change respectively associated with Hydreigon&Guzzlord,Regidrago&Ultranercozma,Giratina and Dragapult and finally Latias/Latios and Goodra of all brats with Drampas,Altarias,Rayquazas and Noiverns found everywhere in-between as preys(all laugh..lot)..when you see Rayquazas as preys you know you're not at a good place in your mind to start with and that's the end of it(all burst..)..well Cili knows it too well but that's a different sector of existence for later(all laugh..lot)..anyway so this was the second most notorious place from every standpoint the only saving grace is that pseudo-legends aren't found here but it's 20 cities and Pallet not 8 and 2 villages no matter they host Pastinoral and Pansetimal psychic cups with open valley battlefields(all laugh..lot)..or the fact that those 8 cities are both big and populated and most importantly rich as hell(all laugh..lot)..so there was a huge concern as to what happens when master brats grasps those places too(all laugh..lot) 19 City except Juritared was all petrified by the prospect barring Frucifern and Pewter and Cerulean anyway matches the wealth of all the rest by 10% so never cared(all laugh..lot) and Cerulean Gym Leaders were the richest in the city cause they had shares everywhere our grandma and her sister and bro-in-law were very very shrewd business people mommy always said thankfully they never met Potent Pendulum rest unnecessary(all burst..,Daisy..Gamely In-Form,all un..)..no what can you do about someone named Gamely In-Form is completely beyond me still(all burst..)..anyway so at the Yellowburst Trials all really got us this was there chance Cladlie and Scarlie were undeterred still no matter what happened and they had no support except their bros and sisters here didn't like their act still no matter they defended them and kept them with them so they had no support barring those who were behind the bars now except Gladie they didn't make that mistake cause for all the things in the world the only thing those brats don't like is people messing around with our newborn baby at all rest assured(all laugh..lot)..courtrooms were ok provided Stu McShin and Marlee were with her anyway the only people who were neutral at 16 cities barring being immune to judiciary they themselves day one said Gladie is going to stay with them till abdicated(all laugh..lot) the WaterFires took this opportunity to viciously infight only(all burst..) but had they tried the prisons with Gladie it would've had very bad ramifications for the sanity of the outside world due to differences commitment look intention now Hologram(all un..long)..man they were so terrified by Daily Hologram there they said we never heard of anyone who invited people to his cell and visited others uninvited including the guards and the main station turning it into a university intention look commitment now Hologram..specifications take a random counter(all un..long)..anyhow(all un..)..this all is barring Guzzle Humdrum though about not liking people disturbing Gladie with trifle stuffs like practicality not habituation(all burst..,..Gladly Syndrome) so Guzzle Humdrum was unperturbed amongst everything(all laugh..lot)..he knew the things they summoned him never went anyway unless paid the journey fare never left either unless similar terms morality Guzzle the honest humdrum(all un..)..this was same for all of them also the fact that they did some works where they went always prison and Huntelion Middle included ethics Hands-On(all un..)..anyway so they summoned Stashey second time they didn't pay the money cause it was a case he was the convict writing this reason he wrote back(laughing..) Mr Stash Ketchum as that was what was required to be present rest of society in equilibrium of desire and knowledge will find the solution themselves(all un..long)..so third time Police came to take him with him but he insisted on going to prison for a change cause they didn't provide foods during court sessions(all un..)..so at prison he was denied when he jumped on a police car in too much glee hence they had to detain him in terms of self declared Morality(all un..long)..then later they let him off obviously(all laugh..lot)..then he started for Saffron trials still going on all says he's a fugitive but he himself foiled their plans as he always asked everyone how to go to the city borders and so on thus trip to Saffron was validated as direction than destination Guzzle the Desirous Humdrum countering also while countering..just to be countering(all un..long)..then he reached Saffron and all in the meantime True Vaccine had the biggest misfortune to indict like,Ei..me me me me me me me/Ei..Focal Bludgeon whose your thee(all un..long,Aptly Opine,all un..)..so no progress was made like, hurry question's logic concur/else axiomatic soundness's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..but it was nothing like the very first day(all laugh..lot)..\n..(Recording Ole at Yellowburst Trials)..\nJudge(frown) : \"Mr Ole Ketchum welcom\"\nOle(thumping..) : \"Suruptisomonosatibom (all un..long)!..\nOh Ole look now i at the wheel/telling how good did you logically feel(all un..long)/Oh Ole look asking can you feel the rational chill(all un..long)/Mafaopile..intention to be Funteramlon you to me appeal(all un..long)..any questions invited most fervently and humbly as to on my place in your proprioception(all un..long)..so they realized this isn't going down well(all laugh..long)..but finally all hell broke lose when they summoned of all people Pubu Dislom(all burst..)..to annotate the movements and judge their correctness as that was the strongest direction to sue the master brats as discerned by like Jimmy Jimmy call to meaning Hologram(all un..long)..man he still says it's been 50 Years now you brats have thoroughly wasted this term for me enough with it(all laugh..lot)..we knew it won't go down well with how Pablo uncle was dealt with just took 7 years in making that's all(all laugh..lot)..and ofcourse we all knew TerryBilly and MillieDilly forever(all laugh..lot) but a sample like CammieSilly we didn't meet before Gissie is just a eversweet kid but CammieSilly is a sample of all times like Silly(all un..)..man what a month that was(all laugh..lot)..and True Vaccine picked up so many accolades for handling the situation properly will Fowldung being our chief opponent with Munu lad(all burst..)..then Davo son was there they were appointed since the Frucifern Crematorium Exams began and it took 11 long years for them through bush and hay to finally settle down after which debuted DoDo NotSoSure(all laugh..lot)..but it was nothing like MyOhHeadShook(all burst..)..firstly he had to bear the starting of Dashing Rock then DaisyDevil then The Adventurers of Lexicon(all un..long) then Viol flower then then Jubilee Hands-On then Who-oh-Forlorn(all un..) then if all of these weren't enough before he and his family could get off to Hoenn both his granddaughters were caught by how was the first day of school for your granddaughters,got married to Fortune Haps and yeah all are 3.5(all un..long,Guang and Itzel,Gus and Yagmur un..)..this was day 1 next day as the military was there came Guzzle Humdrum(all laugh..lot)..next day was Lastly Phantom then Daily Hologram then Simile Popcorn to end the week then Shadowy Lantern during weekends all were so despaired(all laugh..lot)..then throughout the month all the Master Brats came around in 4 weeks with the other 2 days one day The Feathered Ones debuted then the very last day of the month annotated rather than connotated disciples(all un..) debuted who were horrendous menaces to to any sort of analysis(all laugh..lot)..next month our 13 little brats debuted with Centy and Putu added who knew how to adulterate with procedural rules when they were 3.5 as much they knew how to inflicted recurrent riles upon themselves(all laugh..lot)..then this month featured the education of Guzzle Humdrum and the rest of the master brats,Guzzle Humdrum stayed for 1 week,rest 2,their interred disciples(all un..) 3 weeks and The Feathered Ones a whole month stayed that was all for Education(all laugh..lot)..Fortune Haps stayed for 2 months just to corroborate to their wives who insisted on going to school for some wired reasons(all burst..)..as Ibtuk was told yeah their names have been changed,i'll sue those..to Cassette Capture and Asset Future anything else they asked(all un..long,..Fortune Claps,all un..long)..man what sort of menaces these are who out of existence chose only ME as their primary target(all laugh..lot,..Dr Oak Dr Oak)..then Convene Skats also stayed at school for same time span then next month dad embodied into abstraction thankfully though for him i understood after the Team Plasma Sic chapter 7/8 months later(all laugh..lot)..The Great Boss still says they would feel relieved cause they were yet to meet horrendous menaces like Crawdauntogator yet TYRAniTAR he said we consciously stayed away from them whenever we had to use translators or any sort of signals(all laugh..lot)..then after Yellowburst trials the master brats unleashed with their sponsors and disciples as Weyo,Hemu,Doctor Slate and DaisyDevil finally went in Kanto in wilderness in the name of training requirements(all laugh..lot)..so all still settled but on the strike of 3rd week Juritared who were laughing at the rest 19 for 16 years by then suddenly found at their doorsteps Looking Vendor nothing else(all un..long)..like,\nSatiation's Tiffin Concur/Else self your expectation's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)/oh being hurry reach conclusion don't again analyze render/Else look consciousness in relativity of certainty with absolute pedals ponder(all un..long)..Oh Looking Vendor/Hurry Hire or Bargain else satiation's Coffin Saunter(all un..long)..man they said Juritared has the strongest security in whole of 20 city ring even better than Stonegarnet but with this all automated machines revolted against their algorithmic progress to metaphysical digress(all burst..)..but finally 5 days after this came Cross Arm Defence(all burst..)..all were suspicious as to what Coffin Saunter and Lastly Phantom was going to do so Juritared anyway was on red alert but none goes to the gym valley anyway(all laugh..lot)..man after that it was an absolute mess there(all laugh..lot)..",

itself does the promotion but Stash doesn't promote people unless he knows them too well like Mr Kulinak was a below average general combatant but he always booked him in tough fights and he always delivered due to his limitations entailing thought entailing despair as it's said not due to his skills entailing analysis entailing construction as if countered it's a completely different world as they said determination : the spin of lexicon(all un..long)..then Ms Sonrisa and Solaria Dazmatas were promoted only in their first region now in second they're only promoted by Ebonypitch branch of Dr Oak's lab(all laugh..lot)..and Mr Kulinak have retired already as he said so yeah may be a good idea but i have a different stream of exploration here i'll talk about it in moments(all burst..) but does he have any current customers cause Sonrisa and Solaria has been off for 2 years now and Mr Kulinak wasn't in this profession anyway(all laugh..lot)\"\nMay(bit excited) : \"oh yeah he has a lots of customers to start with he has Mr Redzep Rafolrat Mr Humberto Rafolrat's son he's Kalos Head Radzie i spoke wth is a general trainer Kanto and Kalos winner shared with Ms Krystal Kinrel for first 2 leagues now at Sinnoh..(giggle)..his title is no association imputed(all un..long)..(giggle)..like Mr Hummm-Bertoooo-'Nough on Stat(both un..)..(all un..long)..then he has Mr Barry Winston his title is Found-Barrel why ask obviously thus not mentioned so look In-Some(all un..long)..he's a fighting/normal specialist(all laugh..lot)..then he has Mr Paul Pecnil Genkie's opponent in Round 128 at Johto his title is..(giggle)..Oh my Pulu Pencil be mild on nil/as that is just another on how do i feel(all un..long)..he's been added the newest then there's Ms Olivia Ombigaf a psychic specialist and Mr Jaheem Kentimak a bug/fly specialist they are travel companions and childhood friends they are in the ranks too Olivia's title is Oh-Living-via-Ombigaf(all un..) and Jaheem is Ja-him-no-Kentimak(all un..) they too i spoke with are like so young you know epistemologically Seth said so delicious the food hence only registered(all burst..)..then there's Mr Terrence Bistorter and Mrs Mildred Dislom Bistorter you know them whole world does the only ones with whom A Random Tryrantum behaved properly due to much love and affection as they were in a tough situation and he knew them since babyhood(all burst..) they are called TerryBilly and MillieDilly together The Inverted Ones(all burst..) and Terry is a fire specialist,Millie is a poison specialist Terry was very wise and steady as it's said the substitute for poised(all burst..,Cedar and Gladys,Poppy..Oh Now my Ready to Oak/Oh Now thus reciprocally signs my Steady Oak,all un..long,Guang..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long,Gary and Lillie too un..long)..but Millie seemed too effusive like Gemmie Doctor Slate's youngest sister Gemma they are very similar in their lack of understanding of perspectives not refusal they just don't understand what's humanity(all laugh..lot)..(giggle)..but what do you know about it(all un..long,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May too un..long)\"\nDrew(thoughtful) : \"oh yeah after Mr Skechit was unveiled as Mr Tracey-the Jackal-Sketches-It(all un..long,Drew and May..Tracey-Looking-Most-Sly-Fox,all un..long,Tracey shakes..)..we were in final sem of our qualification then so a question came i remember what it actually asked that was to describe the neutrality of THE in sense vs mood(all un..long)..so it comes down to neutrality vs specificity in usage of witness so i said it's evident in this question as Mrs Fressia Waterflower Ketchum propounded this scheme,Oh Mr Sketches It doing it from cue but tell us why cue never While doing(all un..long)/thus jumping into ocean of variety with categorically unattached but deductively uncharged Marill witness will be ruing(all un..long,Tracey too un..)..\nbut strangely the examiners said why Marill isn't replaced by faculties we don't know what does Marill specifically mean(all un..long,Tracey too un..long)..so then i recalled that song by Ms Volbeat at Cerulean itself on this issue of observational functionality not operability(all un..)..so it was that,\nAs look managing of difference is opining never tuning(all un..long)/jumping into specialization of characters with Icy Cold determination Yet in Psychic integral with it in properties being an Icy cold though Psychic Dewgong will be ruing(all un..long,..Daisy un..long)..then again they repeated the question on why i'm not saying faculties but using recurring named entities to point out to the difference of understanding thus orientation of same faculties as perceptive not incisive(all un..)..ao at this i said well it's the unsolved questions as to why one likes a particular thing most only if it satiates the need of survival like a gender to start from(all burst..)..then they said there's no reasoning attached to these named entities at all only the invitation for penetration which only gives a recurrence to the meaning(all burst..)..so i said exactly the neutralizing feeling the specific healing the most entertaining never possible to give only enact in self that boomerang to the elusive centre of choice not need of any dealing(all un..long,..Service of The Elusiveüêâ,Cilan shakes..)..then they liked this answer i don't know why after i said choice is elusive to need(all un..) but anyway this is what i felt about humanity you know the witness of the engineering crew,engineering the meaning of you(all un..)\"\nMay(bit thoughtful) : \"um..yeah like if asked who then the question is asking why to stop the process itself in the name of any meaning that may be dew exactly what is asked about the reflection of anything that's you(all un.. long)..but(giggle)..this also reminds me of the other sort of promotions he did but before that he has 3 vacancies now actually so would Tony come too..\"\nDrew(happy) : \"oh yeah Tony will get in too even if i don't no trouble(all un..,..Tony Boy)\"\nMay(excited) : \"oh yeah most certainly Cuo spoke in a great length about his presentation faculties of heuristics to what he's presenting as to why he is doing what he's doing rather than merely describing IT(all un..long,..Curly Mention,all un..long)\"\nDrew(happy) : \"yeah and he said no Drew they know the podcast of generality you know not the questioner of assurance(all un..long)..hence he said they don't impute essence at all thus like as Lillie says cloud of specifity doesn't specify only personalize necessity(all un..,..Lillie flower)..so it's way clearer he said now as to why he wants to do something rather than what he has to do(all un..)..so yeah definitely he'll get in i have a different stream of thoughts which is why i'll discuss it with them\"\nMay(happy) : \"yeah and thus drop this attention to it in my presence immediately else biases will be formed due to my decision (all un..,..The Unanimous Ones,Drew and May un..)\"\nDrew(thoughtful) : \"yeah indeed but does he require all of his clients to know each other and also past and present\"\nMay(thoughtful) : \"well may be cause Snorie and Slirrie were complaining to Gungie that Barry were disturbing them with denomination of unknown in algebra vs encapsulation of known in any criteria(all un..),so yeah probably\"\nDrew(bit thoughtful) : \"well then there might be a trouble cause Tony said after his last cup that he met someone who he couldn't know only consolidate as oh(all un..long)..\"\nMay(very happy) : \"was it Namburek cup that you said he wants to do cause Stashey said Oliv is too impatient to let the Police finish their introduction of their location(all un..long)\"\nDrew(happy) : \"oh then it's very easy for him to get in in terms of defences of loh! i'll tell him(all un..long)..but um..Mr Jaheem,Mr Paul and Mr Barry are they free from questions of vectorial not nominal monitoring(all un..long)\"\nMay(thoughtful) : \"um..no Barry's other half Winona i met too an electric specialist she even looks way younger to Max in terms of definition of conviction and cessation(all burst..) about Jaheem he was rejected by someone about which he complains that he followed the customs perfectly as to ask properly for a date the first time he wanted to go alone which was rejected instantly hence he said next time i'm going straight to registration office only if Alone(all un..long)..and that's Flavia who also speaks with Gungie,Gus,Cuo and bro all time cause she's the versioning criterion of Mr Harris's other half Brenda who bro said doesn't understand the kinds of automations of respect thus fell into the trap of happiness thinking to further inspect(all un..long)..then there's a great recording about this Harris son ofcourse was in the courses of study itself(all un..,Cilan and Jennifer..Viri Ri Ri Zion Zi Zi On Viri Ri Zi On/Call me Groundon or oh now gone to personality of chance the professional mention,all un..long,Seth..The Professional Oak Halves,all un..long)..anyway Flavia bro said complained that Jaheem mentioned where he wants to go before saying the word date and he wanted to go to the nearest training facility to see a few matches to celebrate the occasion but Flav said this is unfair to the idea of dating as personal correspondence not objective hindrances(all un..long,..The Brochure Ones,all un..)..so she also said next time she's only coming out if not alone from registration office(all un..long,..The Manual Ones,all un..long)..and yeah they have contacts still all the time and says these themselves all time if this topic comes up among like siblings they just don't contact each other real time or facetime(all un..long,..The Monitoring Ones,all un..)..they met during an University fest on ground type pokemonsk(all burst..,..Dashing Leading Rock,Brock un..)..so yeah that's the reason why he's in but Pulu i don't know they didn't say(all laugh..lot) so yeah this is the reason Redzie ofcourse were like Mr Litman but he refused to promote single persons due to this infatuation with ideology(all burst..) hence came here(all burst..,Iris..no Mrs Rarcia don't drink that water so quickly else it only reveals your inability to attend to the issue enough and your needs not enough dually in both ways my Raboot didn't understand this you know hence took 2 more battles to evolve,all un..long,Iris..Marc The Mr Litman..no further singular issues involved..countering,all un..)..and that is also because Stashey knew him like forever as i said(all laugh..lot,Guang&Cuong..Mr Hummm-Bertoooo 'Nough-of-Stat,all un..)..anyway but there are a few recordings on these..\"\nDrew(bit excited) : \"yeah Tony said nighttime trainings waking them up suddenly as we ourselves will then talking about memory loss and lack of physical harmony yeah i'll see this(all un..,..Tony Boy)..anyway welcome then at
