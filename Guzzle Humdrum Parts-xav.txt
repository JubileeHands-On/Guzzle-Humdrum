 to be so(all un..) before yourself dying to know how to be dead thus alive as BEING so(all un..)..why compeer why would you be talking about random things compeer despite we confessing that we're beggars defined as those who doesn't have any of them why would you argue compeer even before 'death : the clap of honesty' why(all un..) ,i said linguistically compeers meaningfully i'm only being BEING to be so, countering isn't it(all un..,..The Vulture Frontier,all un..) then i did die Ciddy probably what i recall of it that pain was so unassailable but then itself along with it simultaneously i heard,this is pain this is pain what to do this is pain countering isn't it rhyming with Manectric(all un..,..Guzzle Hundrum,all un..) so i don't know what you're talking about Ciddy ofcourse i'm a pathetic coward i'm too lazy too foolish too egotistical Ciddy countering them isn't it in meaning not being,countering(all un..,..Convicts of Morality,all un..),so i said man why didn't you spare us this time(all laugh..lot),no i didn't wish to come Ciddy this place is of little use to me except among others it's the most Ensuing(all burst..) this idea Ciddy of difference with so many degrees that HUMAN plane has so many fascicles so many VARIETIES..shh..MADDENING(all un..,..Guzzle Humdrum,all un..) just like any plane Ciddy this is where the body lies but everything that is dual is a being Ciddy in consciousness the elusive existence playing as potent to be what it wants yet wanting that is essence, countering patience Ciddy countering the patience of duality TO BE THE MOST ENGAGING,countering isn't it really(all un..),i said man just leave my nerves ok(all laugh..lot) i can perfectly understand now what happens when you try to teach human lexicon to a Jangomo-O(all burst..),i don't know what you're talking about Ciddy but all i heard was,
Oh Jangomo Oh don't be a questioner of this dual mental seal/that when you try to do anything it will ask to be that while though with it you deal(all un..)/Thus welcome Hakamo-O to combat that is those detached feels/but now their practice assures that you become them stepping on their forbidden meal(all un..)/ hence oh Hakamo Oh you say that illusion of you and me and so/is all not when i am sought as it's only a reference of being real look it says now Kommo-O(all un..)..
so i said fare enough why this interest in certain philosophy books and all then,a negation of terminology not confidence(all un..),that you will negate everything that is put there cause the author only wants you to see the meaning that is the indifference (all un..),Emboar(all un..)! But what would any thing refer to you.. existentially though not possibly(all un..),thus to you like the books i read and lectures i heard and conversations i had are only reflecting difference (all burst..), mathematically Ciddy why else is math so infatuated with axioms Ciddy why not be causal with them rather why(all un..), cause no progress will be possible in the necessary of being not necessity of definitions of things that's why(all burst..),the emotional rings of ego Ciddy in itself an axiom of being like the ring in itself in definition countering(all un..)..i said i challenge you take this book and say what they mean,'i see a primer on ABC what's the use Ciddy cause what's the sufficiency(all un..)..
Oh humdrum humdrum guzzle guzzle/unless existence is pure impure consciousness nuzzle reflective bliss..cue(all un..)..','i said it's a travesty that people forced you out of road(all laugh..lot),no the Police did Ciddy they said we can't work without difference thus get off the road unless you pay DIRECT taxes(all burst..) so i went to sewage Ciddy where they asked me strangely why i want to do that work i was surprised Ciddy why do they want to recruit people who will interact with them being not them Ciddy despite knowing what to do which they will tell him if they are sane to start with why this personality comes in Ciddy why(all un..),i said even there you would've found a glitch to give an excuse(all laugh..lot), your assumption is wrong Ciddy professionalism itself is an excuse,excuse of parity(all un..) cause if truly one how can you act Ciddy without acting as me rather than thee,reflectively(all un..),i said man why are you spoiling my day having employed me(all laugh..lot),to concatenate or connotate the idea of me indeed(all un..)..we don't require this Ciddy neither do the pokemons nor you the inventors this requirement is of duality Ciddy thus don't fall into it's illusion that it's real,really though not dually,countering isn't it(all un..),i said look you have so many labs across the world why don't you allow me and my other half to get away from this madhouse(all laugh..lot) and no she will oblige cause you can send the brats there anyway under her care i will find a job so that it's a win-win deal for all sides concerned,reflectively Ciddy what you meant was just asking me why aren't you me,in terms of what is logically rechargeable though not consciously malleable,countering isn't it(all un..),i said listen we've come up with a groundbreaking stuff why the fire of your desire never quench(all laugh..lot),TYPHLOSION!(all burst..) you know the other day i asked Typhie are you aware compeer are you aware of what you are is being just you(all un..),he replied consciousness lad the proper question should've been am i aware of representing myself in verb or in proverb the professional one(all un..,..HUSH!PROFESSIONALISM!,all un..,Gary too un..),

Arnold(laughing..) : "man later Zipgarnet police each day asked me or Daxtie that you and your sibling must be making these up(all un..) and we both said look how harrowing our lives have become are you sane even even after listening to the invitational note that was just the invitation itself if you enter which we didn't have any choice but to you'll realize why education is so exhorted tacit or academic cause you atleast can fend yourself against duality unlike this horrendous scheme invented by sick fighting dragons to survive really never dually to be cured of illusion of being(all un..,Kazuhiro,Gary,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja..THE FIGHT OF THIS BEING IS ONLY TO BE/ARE YOU FIGHTING OH NORMAL DID YOU LEAVE FIGHT TO TO BE,all un..,Brock..DUALITY HANDS-ON,all un..)..man Jubilee Hands-On and his entourage especially the baby vulture has spoiled society thoroughly(all laugh..lot,Kazuhiro,Gary,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja un..)..anyway still this was only like 30 minutes atmost with the rhymes and all for him to come up with these(all burst..) and yeah innumerable brats jumping up and down given the calls(all laugh..lot)..but then we after 6 months were ready for school and all so was shifted to Boulder as master brats refused to look after us cause they were being foisted physical vultures previously was only mental(all un..),that is a breech of contract same for the master brat cause they refused to send the vultures to existence for process though before business didn't clarify if they will be acting outside consciousness as well like finding a means to to the business which to them was also the fact the master brat didn't clarify if the vultures were generalizable or only abstract in profit or tax and so on(all un..)..so Boulder intervened but there we met Dashing Dashing Rock(all laugh..lot)..ofcourse we heard about him and all then meet her,bro so great to see yo..,Oh my dears don't think of discrete as continuity of feelings they ask as tax(all un..)/the continuous only is in continuity is your feelings to be all and then of inclusiveness ask(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) we understood why bro always talked about Doctor Dash(all laugh..lot) we understood then and there we could literally kick him or pull his ears just that FEELING(all laugh..lot,..LEADING ROCK,all laugh..lot,Brock shakes..)..but anyway then finally started the 3 years of something that is absolute unforgivable by that itself(all burst..),so now Zipgarnet was hosting Guzzle Humdrum in full form who was a freelance worker,worker : the kindness of morality(all un..),so he could be contacted anytime between 23:15 to 3:15 at either of the crematories always beside the ponds(all laugh..lot)..and Simile Popcorn invaded Kitesky,Shadowy Lantern took over Rimsable perfectly(all laugh..lot),Daily Hologram went to Bosangria and finally Lastly Phantom obviously went to Juritared(all laugh..lot),as Column Jargon went to Rimsable and Curly Mention with Colony Monogram invaded Bosangria(all laugh..lot),Yellowburst helped the conglomerate to delegate their gym as privately run(all laugh..lot),whole Cerulean vetoed against any invasion from either side infact they set up vigilance(all laugh..lot,Gary,Kazuhiro,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and ...) Frucifern made any living resource private properties to the central city authority working with the other foot too the only time they collaborated so wholeheartedly(all laugh..lot,Kazuhiro,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and ...),then finally there was Pewter(all laugh..lot),Pewter to all these objected against Mr Wolfgang's ruling to the interregional symposium judiciary who said and you were the ones few years back saying mere ego that feeling(all burst..,Brock,Kazuhiro,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and ...),so Boulder came under strictest imaginable surveillance exactly as all of them wished,COUNTERING(all un..,Kazuhiro,Seth,Genkai..THE PARACHUTES OF MORALITY,all un..,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and ...),anyway(all laugh..lot),but because Column Jargon,Curly Mention and Colony Monogram were Oak Lab employees they didn't intrude the city only the community of their interest(all laugh..lot),which ofcourse was there cause many trainers there objected the pitiful condition prevailing and whole Zipgarnet trainer's community shifted their bunch to Cerulean and Frucifern creating an absolute mayhem at both places which again required the interventions which meant things were back to order but then within 6 months all realized Guzzle Humdrum isn't the one to be afraid of rather his brokers were especially the middling one rest were rather happy no matter the shadow atleast they weren't yet Phantoms(all laugh..lot)..should it be plural..universality phantom(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) anyway it was impossible the ominous cloud of jubilation surrounding whole 11 city,countering lexical plausibility rhymes saw(all un..,Genkai,Kazuhiro,Seth..THE TRAVELLERS OF RELATIVITY,all un..,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and ...)..anyhow(all laugh..lot),so the dust settled but strangely only at Zipgarnet cause unlike other places they couldn't gauge what was to happen atleast the rest were ensuing themselves this brat was insufferable by his very existence it's strange how his very sight forces you to react(all laugh..lot)..which ofcourse we found out in our first visit after 6 months to Zipgarnet,so we went to Police station and then to the crematory now everyday a big Police force used to go there for copyright issues(all burst..),so we went with them 3 gentlemen and 2 ladies so we too went and this time this brat was as usual beside the pond actually we didn't want to face him cause he told us not to return before we became WOKEN(all laugh..lot) cause it wouldn't be necessary otherwise would it rationally not logically(all un..),so then we stayed there with the Police,firstly it was 1 at night(all laugh..lot),now we asked why so late Police said himself speaks from 1 to 2 only(all burst..),so we went before 1 and settled in 6 months made absolutely no change in his physique we asked what does he eat these days,same stuff scavenges garbages,eats left overs if any other asks gives it to them always still stays within a kg same as his 4 elder twin brats are these pokemons a cross between all sentience thus not processed only objected actually little ones you would know(all un..,Kazuhiro,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and Stash..Dr Oak Dr Oak WHOSE THAT POKEMON,i guess in terms of fortitude you meant,all un..,..HUSH!PROFESSIONALISM!,Gary shakes..),anyway(all laugh..lot) so we sat comfortably among leaches ofcourse(all laugh..lot)..now he is sitting beside the pond sometimes doing hand combat and so on bobbing and weaving(all burst..,Kazuhiro,Seth,Genkai and Blossom,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja and ...)..while saying..

Arnold(laughing..) : "yeah thanks(all laugh..lot)..then those animals and snakes and all some bit him some scratched him some played with him and so on but they were hungry and so on but then they left we realized it was just a party for them as he himself said a great party,of logic,logic : the deception of compassion(all un..),then one of the Policemen asked us(laughing..) if he was very caring in his(laughing..more) mental not attentive life(all un..),we said just shut up and watch ok why are you so concerned with lexicon(all laugh..lot),he said no i found if i say these eventually my little daughter falls asleep as she doesn't understand what to make of it in emotions(all un..),anyway then sometimes later a few people came in who weren't completely physically concrete as humans so now they came in we asked why are they allowed in if so much is your apprehension that he can spoil effectiveness(all laugh..lot),they said no they petitioned that they should be given an opportunity to thank us for the same as taught(all burst..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so they come in and ask him like yo man are you ready today,fictionally indeed frictionally thus look conceived(all un..),then they said no man it's hard you know it's hard to live without this and that,ofcourse compeer that's why i'm being a namecall to my thoughts(all laugh..lot) but you know when you know that you have something in potential you know you have it then when you know it to be so you understand that indeed i have it then when you do that you are assured then insured then convinced then one then ingrained then you have it indeed but alas now looking at it where is it except in logic that they are playing all along while being so much them they in the very beginning did posit that with us compeer you will be happy as we will come to serve/thus we will indeed come handy to you compeers but why are you asking how we ourselves in you could be barred,countering THE MOST ENSUING,rhymes saw(all un..)..hence anything will demand it to be treated as a thing from me compeer thus despite being mine oh only my they will greet my ego and ego itself to self and self to me in circulation never hallow but hi isn't it(all un..),then they said no we can't stop this and that,ofcourse you can't compeer ofcourse nor can i the desires the achievements the failures the moments the trepidation my trepidation is what if i can't come up with this language this feeling on top of detachment this feeling of invincibility of logic man it's so soothing it's all of me really but you know then no matter what i did i found despite memories i can't go out of me strangely cause i just did as i thought so,countering isn't it hence the word in lexicon round but still we go(all un..),then they said but how do you manage it,by failing to do that by failing compeers failing to understand that to interpret that but mostly by failing to fail in that when i want something i get it compeers i get it just as i want hence i fail to get it as much i want countering isn't it(all un..),hence this idea of any thing really makes me successful hence i realize i can't do without them thus i don't like staying in a void exactly why any thing that comes up like the void there i counter them else i would live in a void won't i(all un..) so that of their consciousness they become paranoid that what if we too like this being become trapped in our own self never found unless as a thing it's so void,countering(all un..),but then once i will passing through this place at night many cosmologies later from now just as you perceived what you can(all un..),these ideas of desire and their unbinding will continue to pursue me hence then i better become one with them compeers by failing to become me or them,countering(all un..) but at present as i do now those vultures of shore asks me why are you coming to the shore compeer of the reality why would you not enjoy more compeer at being facilitated and trained and privileged to surf around there have some fun as you wanted why would you contradict yourself compeer by want rest meaning your efforts to become trained was only a matter of waste that is the ocean of laziness you can't deem dangerous at all you've been trained to live there ASPIRING to be on top of you how could we help it if you want all(all un..),but while they were saying it i found them being questioned by reality in terms of disturbance of silence within existence of which none told them to be conscious unless they wanted to appreciate it's grace(all un..),so i thought ok but why would something that is real would chastise the percepts of suchness then reality strangely told me countering being but why would you ask as you already are being(all un..),so i thought ok purity is required in desires then strangely desire told me countering satiation compeer but why would you ask if you're the one out here looking for it(all un..) so when i came out of the museum of reflections as part of my visit to a children's cress of Butterfrees at the behest of a Pidgeoto i thought indeed i should really BE pure indeed but on the way a Bulbasaur was surprised hearing it saying that's the poison of grass being there without intervention yet desire just as they want to be they have to come out of their attentive leisure reflecting compeer not countering but why would you ask(all un..) i said Ah i get you compeer i get you that's why to me thee welcome never by isn't it countering in viseversa never hallow by hi reflectively in counters of to be and being why(all un..),then they were happier and went off and so on then he was all alone now now says..
mind mind mind..mind mind/how to be all..by being after all(all un..)..thus i can't ..as you are in the stall(all un..)/mind mind mind..mind mind/oh this down and up oh duality really pass to be the illusive grass..of purity surpassed if mind(all un..)/mind mind mind..mind mind/fight of feelings fighting the detached dealing thus fighting types only if it's compacted to be so beautiful to mind(all un..)/mind mind mind..mind mind/the percepts of memory the statistics of dual theory is the non dual sensory just to be no more worried of the same mind(all un..)/mind mind mind..mind mind/find mind how can who will as well the thoughts here in mind(all un..)/oh reality mind mind mind..dually mind/that's mind mind mind..mind mind(all un..)/countering mind mind mind..reflect mind(all un..)/mind mind mind..mind mind(all laugh..lot)..
and this was my out of complement daily medication(all un..) i was told like..
i want want want this/lets now try this just mind(all un..)/oh mind mind mind why mind(all un..)/that's mind mind mind..look mind(all un..)..
so(all laugh..lot),in the end i realized the abject foolishness i was subjected to was so much more useless than even what i was doing hence myself recovered then the doctors were really happy and all but Chris uncle gravely said with a huge scowl like what's to be happy about this you buffoons didn't you see his prescription while writing your own THIS IS CALLED 'RECOVERY : THE CENTRE OF DISEASE IN REFLECTION,did you ask IF it's from SELF OR DUAL observation countering'(all un..)..well this cause i was told to enjoy my disease cause it only shifts you to other levels of your self mentally though(all un..)..man that 1 year was so terrible(all laugh..lot),mom rather was treated normally cause of her ideas and all so all were surprised seeing her real nature as you saw so they asked Jubilee Hands-On once how did you manage to stay healthy living with a sick Jangomo-O,he said no we were aware of the diseases thus they could come but rather than contemplating on them we did it with them so it wasn't a trouble at all they are part of us anyway(all un..)..so it really was miraculous as to how they survived later Kuhu,Effie and Dishi said that disease was really all about physical not mental but were intermixing hence the confusion but none knew how to interpret the mind of a Jangomo-O Jangomo-Os themselves included in terms of the disease both sets only realized the disease and the cure but not how to counter both by diverging from each other to separate them being really them thus failing hence combining them(all un..) if it was the front foot would've taken the normal approach of convergence cause they can understand the technicalities of mind not only it's fractions thus they are not here and these brats are utmost buffoons(all burst..)..but then me and Hertie both sometimes go there just like all of us to stay sane actually(all laugh..lot) and each time we're are told what is what but then in the beginning days we said but even we realized that they were utmost fools they laughed and said it's an opportunity souls don't miss it the foolhardy of being(all laugh..lot),then we asked of Zed whom they said himself can tell you best that's his practice itself(all burst..) who said yeah it's called opportunity compeers indeed as ever they said the foolhardy of being as an opportunity revealed by the Phobias of Ethics(all un..),man i just feel so bad for Mr Otto know atleast Mr Humberto was away and Mr Wolfgang was out of profession and the Police knows they won't have anything like those 19 years you know but i feel for Mr Otto you know really the only one who had to see what sort of brats these were in psychic channels actually in the beginning(all laugh..lot),he said it was like yeah i like you,but but you don't cherish me cause you're the one who just said i'm your beau(all un..,..ZEKROM LIFE,all un..)..next lines if translated,so?do i have to confess my longing for your insecurity of pain(all un..),so now you'll show how your comprehension of duality to you appears as only to not fro(all un..),man not for nothing their brats behave as they do(all laugh..lot)..anyway then back to vision specifically unbound(all laugh..lot),then we went to meet him next day which ofcourse was shown that we've become SO NAIVE(all laugh..lot)..anyway then much later we met Zevi and Duttie there two years later since we left for Boulder and then Master Brat ofcourse had to come out of his completely self inflicted confinement of abject foolishness of being a being countering rhymes saw(all un..)..man Guzzle Humdrum really had to become A Random Trytantum else couldn't work at all(all laugh..lot) and then those last 6 months by the end ofcourse came around Check and Roam(all laugh..lot),we knew from the first sight they aren't at all mentally sane or stable(all laugh..lot)..and were dragons to start with were pure psychics to take a hang of being so and finally were ofcourse pseudo-legends to UNBOUND in that situation to the utmost(all laugh..lot)..but they went straight to lab as again as now the Police were told by Mr Fowldung that he will go away when high school time come up cause his backyard anyway will drop out(all laugh..lot) but he didn't move no matter so now the Police drove him out petitioning for 6 months at the cost of Zevi and Duttie that master brat is spoiling people and so on so all said he won't go himself you have to remove him physically so they told him that you can do this job as you've been banned from leaving 9 cities or entering wilderness present anywhere including air and water(all burst..),so Bosangria can afford you this job as your little bros can come to Zipgarnet then only budged cause knew the aftermath(all laugh..lot)..anyway then he took the job cause his business partners confronted him saying he can't suddenly starve himself to death that breeches the agreement even Jubilee Hands-On couldn't escape that(all laugh..lot),so at Bosangria A Random Tryrantum debuted and Gum says man the first time he came up,so finally duality has caught up with you,indeed so true compeers but why would you ask countering what's true(all un..)..so they knew these are only the various layers of Guzzle Humdrum which doesn't at all end(all laugh..lot),anyway then the rest Serrie knows the best as she has been collecting things for 18 years by now(all laugh..lot)..and it's open like Bazu knows the master brats for 19 years now hence his best friend too will know it's like a default chain there's no exception if there is it's only beneficial to all sides,countering(all laugh..lot)..sometimes people asked why they live their private life in public as they were always told there's nothing personal about them it's impossible as it's professional(all laugh..lot)..and then Mr Wolfgang said all were petitioning that these brats are spoiling SOCIETY(all laugh..lot) he said i always told them ask yourselves two things why the wrong foots are their biggest fans and why the general government are not doing one damn thing about Police making money it's an opportunity compeers these sort of lifeforms don't frequent sentience only

Popcorn : "of the nature's call compeers why instincts are so desperate to know me by means you, countering themselves by trying to make themselves sentient by defining how to mean it to be true thus indeed another always is there how can i be myself if that i can always know but can't ever cue,meaning if reality reality is only there for duality by means of illusion for being to play peek-a-boo but this being one side while playing self-consciousness..boo(all un..).. exactly why the urge for this cue of what may be that isn't there yet it is as else i can't be self only myself what if it's not there welcome to 'existence : the cigar of provable ensue'(all un..,..The Most Ensuing,all un..).."

a person : "um..excuse me Ms Popcorn(all un..,..COUNTERING,all un..,..SIMILE POPCORN,all un..),but if you could care can you be present at City hall tonight at 8 we're going to have a discussion on practices and philosophies we're interested to know your view and would've approached your place but um..you're always found in random in congruence to the meaning of your name hence..(all un..,..SIMILE POPCORN)"
Popcorn : "well it's unethical compeers to go prepared anywhere expecting to be alone there(all un..) hence you may contact the City Police if you wish to meet me out in random only never specific(all un..)"
person1(laughing) : "um..yeah ok thanks(all laugh..lot)"
(at crematory)
person1(thoughtful) : "um..yeah thanks for the opportunity compeer (all laugh..lot),but um..the thing that we will discuss today is tha nature of practice vis-a-vis with reality so our first proposal is that.."
Popcorn : "objection compeer,if you ask me something i will answer you in same term if i'm to be honest not moral(all un..),thus statement of intention is enough compeers let me me answer you else it's only practice or reality : the enlightenment of duality,countering(all un..).."
person2(laughing..) : "um..yeah thanks(all laugh..lot)"
Popcorn : "so as you stated practice or effort and where to go is reality then my first statement would be reduction of enthusiasm in protection of being is it devotional or functional(all un..).."
person2 : "um..but these can't be directional(all burst..).."
Popcorn(thumping..) : "GRENINJA!(all un..,Serena,Bonnie and Clemont..Kalos Wisdom,all un..)..

that Hey!Oh effort effort play(all un..)!no effort now you no now you say(all un..)!that being in between difference of me and being me why only do you say(all un..)..thus now it's my time to shine..i'm gonna take what's mine..that the indifference of oneness's chime(all un..)..
thus my statement compeers that while i take it what would i tell myself to motivate is it devotional or functional the reduction of enthusiasm in protection of being(all un..).."
person3(Suren, thoughtful) : "um.. devotional because(all un..,SURU,all un..) um..being in purity is only pure not a being thus only the devotion will force it to be but this will be direction agnostic as me(all un..)..but um..it will be functional if rather recreation conjoins with enthusiasm reduction changes the state from enthusiasm to necessity both mutually exclusive in intrinsic nature of probability(all un

Popcorn(thumping..) : "MANDIBUZZ(all un..)! but as i will be there will i be susceptible or recuperable to modification by the agnosticism of explorative directionality(all un..).."
Suren(thoughtful) : "um..susceptible as(all un..) um..if i want to modify myself then i muat beforehand know all the states through perceptions if not simulations but um..as i will be there simulations are reality itself hence um.. my being there despite the agnosticism sorrounding the explanation of it's validation will make me susceptible to the modification cause it will mean i'm omnipresent hence redundant to be changed and foolish to think of it within myself but um..if it was judged from the agnosticism of phenomena of

Stash : "you know compeers i will admit to this if any or all of you can tell me something about fear..i'm sure you're not afraid of anything and will do anything to get something you want like j.. but my question is that what do you get compeers do you get object or conception,countering your reception(all un..)"
the gathering(a bit taken aback) : "what do you mean huh(all laugh..lot).."
Stash : "the meaning itself compeers when you get something what do you get the object yourself the meaning the conception of all the satiation the definition or most of all do you get it at all or just your ego to be takes a fall,countering(all un..)..you know when i was of your age many years back many cosmologies that is beyond creation.."
someone : "that's same as h..(all laugh..shaking..)"
Stash : "just now you conceptualized it compeer how can you say you don't know it(all un..)"
someone else : "um..but i never understood anything academic(all laugh..lot)"
someone : "no i did i i liked to do these stuffs always you only for food and shelter me for mental power and philosophical smelter(all un..)"
someone else : "but i only passed high school i'm sure people don't go to colleges to learn these only to expertise in them at university rather for their desire to be admitted to survival's ontological embassy(all burst..)"
Stash : "well regardless of them when you want to do something do you do it or just do countering(all un..)"
someone : "f.. this all what.."
Stash : "infact you can't really be patient calm collected cause the moment you know them you will want them compeer how can you get them at all no matter how you can,countering(all un..)"
all taken aback : "yeah we'll see how you react when they whip your.."
Stash : "well again as i said they will whip me the definition though they mean me the conviction,countering(all un..)..but you know there's a bigger whipping that i'm receiving from being just now you know..the space the time the desire the hunger the pain the suffering of ego the probabilities the ensuing anxiety uncertainty weakness mental,physical and verbal and attentive the existence the consciousness and you can say as many as you want cause you have to just to define have to countering(all un..)..this all compeer pierces me apart me the being me the conviction of sanity(all un..).."
someone : "um..no we feel the same sometimes but um.."
Stash : "you look at yourself the conviction that it's there alas you're here,countering(all un..)..thus you know this object of another let it be anything it disturbs me compeer it tortures me but again me isn't as i said countering(all un..)..when you want to do you want to be alas you can see,countering(all un..)..the fight of now the fight in itself of digression from anything to or fro compeers is only the sough of-countering(all un..),this pain pierces me throughout compeers just as i'm saying to you if i do or don't or the innumerable states in between mathematics nudges my intuition in terms of construction,countering(all un..) anyway but no matter the states in-between no matter the motivations to be or not to be agnostic to the added doing itself you see countering(all un..) as i'm saying this to you if i do or don't or the states in between or no matter how i want to explain to myself it will all be insufficient just as i will tell them being myself,countering(all un..)..so if i'm real the most exhorted but i really am i will be suffering compeers from countering(all un..)..they aren't here for us to catch rather to snatch..the meaning of proverb compeer what's not by means of another if it weren't there how about a thing you can bother,countering(all un..)..so as i was saying you know that you can be happy or you can be neutral or you can be sad but for me it's just the fractals or cognizance that i've had,countering(all un..)..i want more pain or not so all the states self contradictory won't be there neither will those logical due to their structures countering(all un..) but may be as the witness i'm separated though not logically so but there that's actually true to be so,countering(all un..)..thus this detachment from all in feelings and in specifications compeers doesn't grant what i want cause i want that's it for the hope,countering(all un..) this idea of optimism or pessimism is just the bait for comprehension itself if there then just to be countering(all un..).."

Daisy : “um..Mehu,what is Trace doing there?”
Mehadi(brusts into laughter) : “Sweet Sweet Dase..” Daisy(frown) : “what’s he upto now?”
(Mehadi brusts into even more laughter,Lillie enters the room) Lillie : “um..Mehu..what..what is it?”
Mehadi(showing everyone the ring,which she hid before to give the surprize) : “first this” Daisy&Lillie(wonder,smile,laugh,hugs Mehadi) : “my god!..how romantic!” Mehadi(giggle) : “tell me about the time”
Daisy(thinking) : “um..(sigh)..I get it”
Lillie(flustered) : “um..yeah he wouldn’t shopli..(Mehadi and Daisy brusts into laughter)(smile) hey,what..(realizes and laughs)..I see that little brat had it with him all the time when he came in to do the swearing in at the middle of the night(all brusts into laughter)”
Mehadi(laughing) : “and was mobbed while purchasing” Daisy(flustered) : “um..no Mehu keep an eye on him,in too much excitement he’s being reckless” Mehadi(smile,blush) : “um..as usual”
Daisy(smiles,Lillie smiles too) : “Mehu,all these years..then last night... it’s just..” Mehadi(laugh) : “Pokemon Master”
(Mehadi and Daisy brusts into laughter)
Lillie(smiling) : “I wish I was there,though Gary would’ve never kept patience at that time of night,and I was so distraught..bit today as Dase told me..(smile)..he really has become a pest(all brusts into laughter)..”
Daisy(smile) : “it was just insanely amusing..I can never forget this night” Mehadi(laugh) : “and the time”
(both again brusts into laughter)
Lillie(smile,frown) : “hey,you must’ve woken me up..(laugh)” Mehadi(a bit concerned) : “Lil i’m sorry,ok? But he was just..he was suffering as much as I was if not more.” Lillie(bit dissapointed) : “um, that’s ok but..”
Daisy(patting Lillie,smile) : “Lil,all one needs to do is to understand the number and the contents of the hells that she must travel through/before she finally can get to her beau(Mehadi&Daisy brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(surprized) : “yeah,um..but what..”
Mehadi(smile): “Lil,all he was trying so hard to do was to desperately make himself believe that he has done enough to be kicked out once and for all from every relationship imaginable so that now he could just aimlessly roam around the world giving everyone a piece of his mind with his pokemons and fool around with his and all other pokemons all the rest of his life as if himself a pokemon,that’s all”
Lillie(flustered) : “yeah,um..strange”
Daisy(smile) : “Lil just let him come here today,i’ll fix your meeting(Mehadi laughs), anyhow why did he turn on poor Trace again(Mehadi brusts into laughter)Mehu,come on(laugh)..”
Lillie(bit concerned) : “still Mehu, isn’t it just too strange..(Mehadi laughs and hugs Daisy,tears in joy)” Daisy(smile) : “Lil,the hells he talked about to Brock and us Infront of his wife and then the last line,that even a recently turned public meance like him was stuttering about(laugh hugs Mehadi,Mehadi laughs uncontrollably)” Lillie(smile) : “Mehu,get a hold on youself sweety” Mehu(laugh) : “it’s...it’s just..man..(laughes again) “ Daisy(smile) : “Lil,his last line was I don’t choose anyone that’s not exactly me” Lillie(smile) : “Ah!that..um..I get it now..”
Mehadi(smile) : “Lil,all my tears of 5 years or so and all my strains ever all just got laughed away right now,and i’ve been hearing this since he finally confessed..this..this is...”
Daisy(smile,patting Mehadi) : “I guess sometimes things like that need to(Mehadi brusts into laughter again)(surprized,Lillie too) what(laughs)?”
Lillie(smile) : “Mehu,you needed this laugh exactly as your cure and even your first boyfriend Ketchum couldn’t give it(laugh)”
Mehadi(smile,Daisy Laughs) : “well he will argue on this,but Dase(laugh)..um..sorry..it’s just that almost any words is reminding me of his antics since we patched up again..(blush,Daisy&Lillie smirks)..um..anyway,he told me some novels yesterday and the same which Trace is being minutely and intricately introduced to now(laugh,Daisy laughs)..out of which one was on the fact that you and your beau are always ever a couple like as if this life itself a play but you two have always stayed as a couple like forever..as if a destiny..(laugh)but if one said destiny,he’d mouth them off to hell(laugh)..um,sorry..then from there came his ultimate point”
Daisy&Lillie(unison,smile) : “go on pretty interesting” Mehadi(smile) : “see and its about the very personal life of a couple and he has even laughed that barrier off amongst all of us in a way that’s just unbelievable (laugh)..um..please bear with me..(again laugh)..um..sorry, it’s just impossible to forget the antics..and it was only yesterday afternoon when he was absolutely hellbent and on creating every unimaginably cruel and unsurmountable barrier possible between anything and himself..(smile) Dase,Lil,we’re sisters,and your husbands all of us..we’ve just been so intricately bound for so so many years,as one unit,then Seth breaks away and we go through all this and then no matter what,we always had some distance regarding personal life an then suddenly..(laughs again)..um..please stay with me..his words are still buzzing in my ears.. suddenly he app...(laughs uncontrollably)..I just can’t take..(more laugh)..” Daisy(smile) : “you know Mehu,that day with Mrs. Ketchum,we kinda always felt a distance since but she also was so cheerful today,we ourselves just laughed it off”(then Daisy leaves the room for some work) Lillie(smile) : “yeah,um..I feel happy too but I wish I could hear it LIVE” Mehadi(laugh) : “all you need to do is to tell him we were destined to each other in a way so that he feels as though your not saying it directly but insinuating..(brusts into laughter)” Lillie(bit flustered) : “um..I see but..(Mehadi laughs uncontrollably)(frown) Mehu,cut it(smile)” Mehadi(laugh) : “Lil,really I need help(  Lillie)...the way you are speaking is exactly the right one to insinuate something to him(laugh)” Lillie(smile, ehadi) : “I see..”
Mehadi(smile) : “seriously Lil,i’ve been living a dream since we patched up,and you know it doesn’t even feel a bit strange to suddenly call him my husband at all,as if the fact I was ever anything but his wife is very strange it feels”
Lillie(smile) : “yeah,we were taken aback when he suddenly talked about marriage  yesterday but I thought he was just stressing upon the word but now I see the little brat really meant it(Mehadi laughs)”
Mehadi(smile) : “absolutely,and all this words started to flow as soon as he confessed and hasn’t stopped since then..he just goes from extremely serious mood to absolutely 5 year chil mood jusy one moment apart..but you know his worda are as honest as you can believe no matter what the mood is..and as I was saying you can’t say it was our destiny or we were right or best or perfect at all,which possibly is what he is rigourusly teaching Trace now(brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(bit confused): “um..(smile) I see soulmate..always together no matter what..and then he probably extended it to saying all else was like a bad dream not really existent”
Mehadi(smiles,hugs Lillie) : “exactly”
Lillie(smile,hugs Mehadi) : “and thats seeing yourself in your spouse and the hellfire(smile,Mehadi giggles)..and that’s exactly about yesterday-Laugh it out(both Giggle)Mehu,your beau has turned himself into the Greatest Romance Master as well...(both laughs,Mehadi brusts into laughter)Viol would’ve ate him up in joy had she been present physically here(Mehadi brusts into laughter again,Lillie laughs as well)”
Mehadi(laughing) : “she almost did yesterday itself..” Lillie(smile) : “Viol too?”
Mehadi(smiles) : “oh yes!but she can’t come before a day after tomorrow but then(laugh)..he’s hellbent to runaway with me to unknown islands any moment(brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(laughs) : “hmm..that dense little pest has now got real dense..”(both brusts into laughter) Mehadi(laughing) : “too much imagination”(again both brusts into laughter) (Daisy enters,laughing)
Mehadi(laugh) : “what?Trace was scared to death?(laughes,Lillie smiles)” Daisy(laugh) : “they’ll be here for lunch today(Lillie  and Mehadi giggles and hi-fives)and yeah pretty much,(all laugh)none can ever insinuate that(Mehadi laughes aloud) that his flower was never ever not his no matter what(brusts into laughter)” Lillie&Mehadi(giggling,Unison,high-five) : “SOULMATE!” (all three brusts into laughter in a group hug)
Lillie(laugh) : “I just can’t believe how can one have such belief on himself to be right that he just nonchalantly came to patch up as if nothing ever happened and all was a play and rhat very thing turns out to be true the very next morning..the very next day all the difficulties that may be we ever had of any kind among ourselves has been just laughed away with no effort..Mehu,this guy’s real dense(all brusts into laughter)keep an eye always(all again brusts into laughter)..”
Daisy(laughes) : “and sorry Mehu,but even yesterday all we thought was that he was indeed a cheat,and then the next day we ourselves just can’t help but to laugh any resentment off..(all laugh)..this is Patch-Up Master”
(all again brusts out laughter)
Mehadi(laughing) : “and yet you don’t know what he did at Cerulian..(laugh)..oh god!..(all laughs)..after he gave me the ring I came to know that he had first travelled to Cerulian,a city which is his enemy no 1 and you know the viseversa (laughs again)..”
Daisy&Lillie(smile) : “um..yeah but why would he turn on Cerulian,Mehu?” Mehadi(laugh) : “because his flower had to appease random guys coming around for gym badges at any time of the day...(all laugh)..(smile)..no you know what I just feel bad,he’s trying so hard to make up for the years that he wasn’t with me and his method is to either torture himself enough to see how I was actually feeling,but his playfullness won’t allow that so he has turned his attention on in-his-words Cerulian Brats(laughs) roaming around the streets to insinuate(brusts into laughter) Daisy(laugh) : “with that language and antics he’ll restart the Sensational Masters there(all brusts out laughing)..” Mehadi(laughing) : “and if I ever go back to perform again he must be managing and won’t allow anyone except married woman with girl childs aged below 8”(all brusts into further laughter) Lillie(laughing) : “yeah Mehu,he’s just too desparate to make the amends and already doing so with his antics”(all laughes hard) Mehadi(laughing) : “and i’ve been going through for so many hours haven’t slept a bit and look how fresh i’m...it’s just..” Daisy&Lillie(Unison) : “Pokemon Master”(all brust into laughter) Mehadi(laughing) : “apart from the godforsaken Cerulian brats(all laughs)..he’s even more incensed with Vultures..(brusts into laughter)” Daisy(laugh) : “that’s the reporters and pests”(all laugh) Lillie : “and they’ll insinuate(Mehadi brusts into laughter again) always that whatever he may do,he’s just trying to trick people and that he’s a Playboy” Mehadi(laugh) : “exactly,I see the pain that he had been feeling since our separation inside and just had turned on anything that had a hint of personal relationship,old friends,new friends just wanted professionalism from everyone no matter what and absolutely no personal relation...personal relationship to him is defines as Mehadi and that’s all(blush,smile)” Daisy(bit concerned) : “no Mehu,as stubborn as you if not more,would never still come back and say he was sorry if he doesn’t believe he’s done any mistake and would torture himself to death trying to prove to himself that he was morally right and that is all to him let the relationship go if they don’t understand me” Lillie(concerned) : “exactly like you Mehu,and as you said and even now so desperate to heal any kind of pain that he only now glaringly feels he’s put you through unknowingly,now desperately wants to go through you pains again and again to justify himself,really I mean you two truly as he said..” Mehadi(blush,giggle) : “Soulmates”(Daisy&Lillie laughs) Mehadi : “um,you know when he met me yesterday and himself was describing what he did to you and all else I could just see how much pain he’s constantly self inflicting,he real nature is ever the sweet little Seth,but as we broke up and he felt that that nature is exactly what his Mehadi didn’t believe him due to things happening around him and left,so he’ll just try desperately to prove to himself and all else that,that nature isn’t his own at all,and it had gone to a obsession where he’d tear apart anything just to see that whether despite all he did he found his Mehadi again who really still realized what he was trying to do and would run back to him again and again no matter what kind of demon he became.. that’s exactly the hells he was talking about..” Lillie (concerned) : “My god! What a guy..would self mortify himself to any unimaginable hell to find his soulmate again..” Daisy : “yeah,just opposite to Mehu as she was going everywhere only to thrash them apart mercilessly as soon as his Seth showed up in them again and finally was left with nothing getting depressed till that very Seth showed up again,and this you know Mehu,when he was piercing us through and through yesterday he said exactly this as an insult,as soon as he lays his first touch,you’re running arter him without any consideration whatsoever” Mehadi(solemn) : “truly Dase,only he could understand my problem and could do what he did..um..I don’t know Dase,may be I was still way better than his own condition,what he’s doing around now is the actual playfullness that his soul and what he’s all about and you can see how irresistibly enticing and attractive it is now that he’s just laughing off anything he ever did while self mortifying in a way that it just floods everyone away with him to playfullness,but what he had been doing everywhere before,I just got every bit of it yesterday,and you know all those hells he talked about,not only he himself went through all and wanted more and more so did he subject me to go through with him till he himself confessed that he can’t beat me and can’t shrug me off” Lillie(concerned, ehu) : “Mehu,I was really scared you know as well as feeling that abject pain myself,I was really afraid that infact he threatened us that even if Mehu becomes insane after this,he can’t be leagally harmed and all that,and we could sense what kind of monster he really had become and was only going to come at you with absolute all out to settle something that was disturbing him for a long time but you know as just 12 hours later he laughed all that off,i’m realizing monster or master(Mehadi smiles) he’s an extremely honest guy even yesterday did only said point by point why he was hurting us citing what we might’ve ever done to him or to his mom and all that...and none were wrong at all” Daisy(concerned) : “indeed Mehu,now you’re telling us we can see why actually his fooling around and making all us laugh everything off as well,this guy is obsessive in his conviction that whatever his soul is directing him to do,is true and right all the time and its just that thing now in the form of laughter overflooding us as merrily as the hellfire did burn us mercilessly yesterday” Mehadi : “you know,yesterday I cried like I never knew as he was dragging me  through every hell he could come up with and much more than he depicted today and I seriously felt I won’t be able to take it anymore,and in fact twice he calmed me down by the help of his Pokemons (Daisy&Lillie shivering hugs Mehadi)..(smile).. it’s ok,he would’ve gone with me as well no matter where it took him to and you can see that he had the faith and it was only me who wanted to walk with him..he took me to unimaginable depths of hell and all the while was carefully observing me whether I budge or not,if he felt I really did budge he would’ve instantly left me and himself became insane as he would’ve realized even his Mehadi won’t walk with him everywhere,he would’ve become exactly like what a pokemon is his in human body,a total lunatic who only wanted to fool around...and even after I was coming back again and again thrashing all the fake copies he was creating to throw me off..I really thought whether we’ll end ever or not given our own stubbornness and just only then did I realize that he has become an absolute lunatic in his obsession to go hell after till he destroyed every ounce of sanity he ever had and it just didn’t feel to me like we could be stopped or wanted to be stopped because I too had become mad in thrashing all his hells and run after him to finally get together it just didn’t feel I wanted to stop either as he himself didn’t want to,later only realized what I felt then was what he was describing as come for me again and again beyond death..I realized his actual call and obsession with himself to go beyond every death and still continue to run never stopping and sanity or insanity is a mere term there where he went(tears,Daisy and Lillie too has tears in their eyes) he wasn’t Seth Ketchum at all anymore and didn’t care whether I was alive at all or he himself,his being had crossed all limits and he forgot himself forgot me forgot everything just continuing his run as playfully as he is roaming around now to where he didn’t know, didn’t want to know but these too are only words to him,he had become the very soul that we read and that cant be described and was at a breakneck speed just playfully with crackling laughter thay all his agony had now become moving somewhere that none can describe...this is poetic and we read only but as you see your crying yourself (tears rolling down everyone’s cheeks) and then I found out that I too am always travelling along with that playful march of his soul forgetting any identity I ever knew-I didn’t know whether I was alive or dead or whatever I myself wasn’t Mehadi Waterflower anymore as he was no more Seth Ketchum,I too had become the soul thay he had become and was equally playfully going just side by side as if playing hide and seek with each other and my pain and tears had also become crackling laughter just like his,I just then felt eternally always with him constantly just the same thing appearing as two different entities to us(all cries,Mehadi in shivering voice)but now about to merge together but actually we didn’t want to megre we wanted to keep that separation keep that distance between each other just to play that hide and seek eternally like mere kids knowing nothing else,he was me,I was him,we had no difference at all and we were only as if mischeviously keeping that distance only to fool around together always together and nothing there was possible to describe our relationship or anything,we had become the one and absolute only fooling ourselves with this appearing difference that we were projexting to enjoy ourself..in fact then I realized there was never any Seth Ketchum or anything else at all it was just me myself and Seth Ketchum was a thing I myself had created to fool around with myself and exactly to show me that was there ever any Seth Ketchum at all and Seth Ketchum had just shown me that...after this trace kinda state I came back to my senses when I suddenly heard him saying ‘Mehadi, you must marry someone else and have a good family forget a f.. like me whose hellbent of self destructing himself just because he can’ that word and idea of anything apart from Seth Ketchum just pierced me so through and through and then his self destruction which he just had showed me to my own realization that Seth Ketchum is nothing but Mehadi Waterflower,I just couldn’t take it anymore and screamed at him that it’s either him or bust for me he just laughed at my face and that showed his own realization that he went through just like me so many times that he just knew even now he could play around with me all he want and said the words that you won’t be able to imagi..he said ‘if I f .. around any random s.. would I still be f.. you around?’ ..you can understand what he just threw with what kind of audacity and vulgarity at me as if this world with anything what so ever had no value whatsoever at all and he was ever the carefree soul knowing he was totally immune to anything that this world can ever imagine to throw at him and this was the whole point he wanted to show me for all these 17 years I guess which he finally could with complete mastery and utmost audacity which will throw anybody off except his soulmate all while fully knowing exactly that,and now was just as if knew my answer and just fooling around with me as he knew himself his Mehadi was not what was appearing before him but has ever been and being and will be his very own self-he himself-so he now decides to swear around left and right with unimaginable nonchalancy with me as if my appearance to him meant absolutely nothing as he already knew and had the true Mehadi Waterflower ever always with him and will be...and these words along with my realization made me understand that he was still laughing at me with the the perfect knowledge that his real Mehadi will eventually in just a matter of moments pierce through the appearing Mehadi and no matter what he did to the appearance and Dase,when he said-i’ll kill you and enjoy your slow death and see if you want to die like that again and again for me or rather get a moments chance to be with me if the former assured an uncertain but definite permanent union-he meant every word of it as he himself had long surpassed any limitations whatsoever so even if he was in this world nothing really mattered to him at all...and at this moment I just said yes he could never be not but only ever be with me as he knows it himself that I was only he himself(all crying)..this finally appeased the devil and then with that same nonchalancy and playfullness he proceeded formally to define by word what he  exactly showed me first hand that the nothing could describe our bond in between most appropriately except saying that we’re soulmates and now this again would make us laugh out even in this state(tears,but smiling,Daisy and Lillie stopped crying and looking at Mehadi now),he finished it with probably the greatest audacity you can imagine while at that juncture as if all was just as he showed a mere appearance and self illusion with you admitted soulmate and even that that’s the word he laughed off as he knew he had just shown what he meant so his appearance and behaviour or words never matter thus he said that(mild laugh,with tears,Daisy and Lillie closely looking at Mehadi not crying a bit flustered,with faint smiles)Seth and Mehadi are soulmates and this fact no vulture,be it of Cerulian or(all laugh with tears) any other godforsaken breed(now all laughing with less tears)can ever do anything about no matter what they insinuated(all laugh with tears of joy now) and then finally admitted to reconcile with me,only after the declaration that even in his biggest all-or-none juncture,all his steps and actions has thus been rigourously proved so that(all laugh)no Cerulian Brats and Vultures (all laugh out loud) no matter what they insinuated to (all laugh again) could ever prove the fact that Seth Ketchum wasn’t honest with himself(all laughs with tears) Lil,Dase,first to me and now to us all,just as jovially he made us cry to death has he made us laugh to immortality,Seth Ketchum masterfully has shown that no matter what the Cerulian Vultures has ever insinuated to in their damn books(all laugh again),Seth Ketchum by totally self destructing himself has rather directly shown anyone what soulmate really means”(everybody brusts into tears of joy and laughter and engage in group hug,claps) (few moments later)
Mehadi(tears) : “and you know Dase,Lil when I was giggling to him after this realization,Seth was even then still fooling around and his words were ‘why stupid b.. why are you laughing after going through all hells completely losing every bit of your chastity..soulmate,what a f.. word..stupid b..’,can you imagine these words even in that state nonchalantly telling a girl he’s about to get married that she is a stupid b.. and doesn’t have any chastity?..(tears,smile)”
Lillie(shaking,sobbing) : “Mehu,to anybody he can just call the most chaste woman a b.. and the viseversa and would still be equally adored by them,he had just gone beyond any limitations one can imagine...he has firmly proved that the Vultures (all laugh) just can’t even touch him”
Daisy(sobbing and laughs) : “Mehu,I only wish this could be written down or recorded but then again Seth Ketchum then would’ve insinuated (all laugh) just like what his immortal enemies (all laugh) the Cerulian Vultures has done...(all laugh) Lillie(tears,joy) : “and even now we being from Cerulian itself,has he made us curse our own birthplace has as nonchalantly as he could swear at his soulmate telling her she has no chastity,even during reconciliation,to a woman he laughs ‘your unchaste’ just before proposal and she’s loving every bit of it...(claps)..(all laugh and smile and giggle)..Mehu,you’ve known me and Dase how nonchalant we were in our younger days and saw many,but this is only very few can ever do just sitting on the verge of complete destruction only to laugh at the fact that he would still come back no matter what...(tears)..” Mehadi(tears) : “to again and again prove that no vulture would ever catch him or anyone else who dared to follow him”(all tears and joy,clapping) Mehadi,Daisy&Lillie(Unison, ach other) : “Soulmate!” (few moments later)
Mehadi(laugh) : “Trace hasn’t still returned I guess he’s being again dragged through hells”(all brusts into laughter)
Daisy(laughing) : No probably at the Lab,might be checking all the pokemons(laugh) or just fooling around as well..(all laugh)?
Lillie(smile) : “and that little brat yesterday insulted me with the same nonchalancy as when he came back to patch up that no matter what one day we’d still realize that Vultures could never tame him(all laughs)”
Daisy(laugh) : “and before leaving would play a nasty prank with someone who is most incensed with him and just hours later all ¾ years difference would wipe out with a lecture ad around last hours of a night...really,Mehu you need to be gazing him all time(all brusts into laughter)”
Mehadi(laughing) : “Which he himself told his mom to allow him to(all laugh)or else he’ll snatch away Mr Mime and battle him(laugh,others smile),said ‘we have a deal here’ as nonchalantly as you can imagine(all brusts into laughter) and even to his own mom he as audaciously as you can’t imagine said ‘you have an idea about me and especially your daughter’(laugh,Daisy and Lillie wonders)”
Daisy(laugh) : “my god! What level of confidence that nothing really matters” Lillie(laugh) : “if mom and dad were here,he would probably just as nonchalantly go and straight ask them ‘can I runaway with Mehadi to nowhere?(all brusts) and somehow would’ve managed to do exactly that(all brusts into laughter)” Daisy(laughing) : “I just can’t believe that now we just don’t have any barriers what-so-ever between any of us and can just about as well play around to our extent and all the troubls that may come would be thrown at any vulture(all laughs) to try and meticulously get figured out while we enjoy ourselves(all again laughs)” Mehadi(laughing) : “and you know he didn’t even want to come here to apologize yesterday the first place saying he doesn’t need to,I send him Forcefully,went out saying he’ll be late as he has to go revisit his farm plans and would be pretty late,went to his beloved Cerulian(all laughes) gets mobbed..and what a way to describe that as well(laughs) Daisy&Lillie(unison) : “go on,your beau in a half day has created a mayhem that’ll take an eternity to digest and he’s only getting started”(all laughs) Mehadi(laughs) : “you know what they’re thinking about him,and he went to Cerulian on Ganger having only Gerninja as the cover..(Daisy and Lillie laughs)..I told him to be bit cautious but now as you see he just doesn’t care at all and yes i’ll force him to be next time but the antics he did there..(laugh).. according to him, Cerulian Mob thinks 1.he was the one to first reject the youngest flower forcing her into severe depression 2.then he came back to humiliate her,which when fuelled with the previous is pretty dangerous then even more dangerously
3.he broke into her room trying to kidnap her and try to reconcile which was thwarted by the flower who due to security reasons had left for to Elite4 headquarters (all brusts laughter)
thus he proudly showed how he was the one cause due to which the Cerulian City has lost it’s last flower as well(all brusts into laughter) forcing the famous gym to be shut down,all flowers having left the city and finally the Sensational Sisters also having been abruptly closed so people are incensed and he was now their central focus(all faint laugh)”
Daisy(feint smile) : “Mehu,this is too dangerous you know,having only two pokemons no matter how strong they were and flying on Ganger..”
Lillie : “yeah don’t let him next time.. anyhow say” Mehadi(laughing) : “he said he actually played a card to mitigate the anger there by resigning from Hall of Fame,so the Cerulian brats(all smile) now think finally this new pest to public peace(all brusts into laughter) is depressed as our flower has finally trodden over his chest(all laugh) rejecting him(Mehadi shows the ring and all brusts into laughter)..so,this new meance now having been totally distraught has lost his mojo and went into depression and thus resigned (all laugh) so he goes to the police station asks for protection by threatening them that unless he got protection quickly (laugh) he’d shoplift(all brusts into laughter) at this specific address(all brusts into laughter again) Lillie(laugh) : “Mehu,this is just insane..(all again laughs)” Mehadi(laughing) : “so now he goes to Mr Keller and he describes his appearance to the Cerulian Mob as(all laugh) ‘but then appolocalype approachs(all brusts into laughter), suddenly that brat appears off the blue/in all smiles with his sinister crew(all brusts into laughter)/to get to a shop as if to get his due(all laugh)/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(all uncontrollably laughs)” Daisy(laughing) : “Seth Ketchum really has become a new pest to personal space as well...(all brusts into laughter)” Mehadi(laughing) : “then according to him the Cerulians say-> ‘what a night this compeers Cerulian/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon(all laugh)/so compeers lets come and challenge to this man/force him show what he hides below his tan’(all brusts into laughter) Lillie(laughs) : “and he only had Gerninja as fresh” Mehadi(laughing) : “they mob him and accuse him of abducting the youngest flower and insinuate (all brusts into laughter) that the Gym,the Sisters and the Show all gone due to him,infact not one but he has abducted all the four flowers(all brusts into laughter) to which he challenges them 50 on 1 with Gerninja all at a time” Daisy&Lillie(awestruck) : “my god!what if..”
Mehadi(laugh) : “his logic is that the more pokemon the more illusion over his ability” Daisy(concerned) : “really Mehu,you have to lease him well(all laughs)..this is too much” Mehadi(laughs) : “yeah,i’ll but just look at his nonchalancy just hours after going through all hells to get his soulmate and then all of your stares and all..just laughs at everything and then as the number confused them and he said Gerninja isn’t found naturally in Kanto so more confusion,is the meantime he placed the order(all brusts into laughter) Lillie(laughing) : “this is just classic”(all laugh)?
Mehadi (laughing) : “then he retorts them why were they so angry and then appeases them by saying Cerulian has best diamonds in the world so where would he go, buying himself the time to deal in the shop(all laughs again),then the mob retorts all their accusations,tonwhich and now(laugh) please help..he says what do you people want the Sisters or the Performance show(all brusts into laughter)”
Daisy(laugh) : “this was said to a ferocious mob just about to jump on him with one pokemon and limited police in that short space...and this time that he bought,he proceeded with the shopping..(all brusts into laughter)”
Mehadi(laughing) : “this according to him made the mob absolutely confused then he showed them some Gerninja balance tricks all tricks and finally dispersed them completely by saying if they mob him and hold him up,his fiancee wont appreciate the Cerulian people(shows the ring and all brusts into laughter) as much as their diamonds(all brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(laugh) : “then he came here to apologize (all laughs even more)” Mehadi(laughing) : “and he assured them that he had nothing to do with the gym leader he just thought he could help and so on and said she’ll back probably holidaying somewhere brunt out overworking and so on(shows her ring again,all laugh) and before leaving gave them the ultimate advise that no matter how electrifying darling of masses may the sisters has been(all laugh) they have to also settle down and have a nice family(all laugh) and whether their own beloved fans won’t spare them even for this bit(all laughs) which is his sentiment card that totally decimated the mob and he came he with flying colours(all brusts into laughter” Daisy(laughing) : “this just keeps getting better and better (all laugh) he even managed to give an insurmountable defense for us as well..Mehu,long live Pokemon Master”(all brusts into laughter) Mehadi(laughing) : “then he brutally slaughtered all of you(laughs)” Lillie(laugh) : “know evem that would do go on..”
Daisy(laugh) : “we can’t mind anymore at all”
Mehadi(laugh) : “he said first Daisy doesn’t allow him to enter(Daisy laughs),then calls him b.. all the time(all laugh),then when he finally calms her down with how he only tried to judge her baby sister only etc she finally budges and in the meantime Trace comes out to gauge(all laugh) the situation but eats a death glare from Daisy(all laugh) and doesn’t come into any help to him as usual as he has always pestered him whenever he got his flower alone(all brusts into laughter) since Pasio Islands(all laughs even more),then Daisy gives him merching order telling him to at that time of night don’t use her as a shiled to protect himself from infidelity that too on his first night(all smiles,Daisy shakes her head) as if unless she told he would’ve exactly done that(all laugh) which made Daisy to return basking in her glorious victory (all brusts into laughter) while dragging poor Tracy with her as she thought is influence has already corrupted her husband(all brusts into laughter) by every means(all laugh)?
Daisy(laugh) : “he has even made me laugh with this as well” Mehadi(bit concerned) :”but um..”
Lillie(laugh) : “go on my child has got enough recreation for the entire life already”(all brusts into laughter)
Mehadi(laugh) : “Gary is jealous of him for taking away his bad boy championship(all laughs) but quickly cools down as he hears his now well polished defence(all laugh) only to be sent to the lionesses (Lillie laughs hard) who was the biggest threat(all laugh) to his eventual marriage (all brusts into laughter)..then he says that the lionesses directly junps to prey upon him by again calling him names and whatnot while he says that at this time she should take rest which the lionesses brushes aside by accusing he’ll cheat on her baby Mehu that night itself(all laughs) oh and by the way Daisy also told him that he threatened her baby Mehu to reconciliation(all laughs) now the lionesses continues to her victory march depicting how much he has fallen pauses to bite him saying he’ll definitely leave her sister and finally goes to the end by stating he has no chance of reconcilation with anyone to which he all the while says that she must take care of herself and then finally dragging Gary’s name in he tames the lionesses (Lillie brusts into laughter)(all laugh) but still she paws him by giving the marching orders while reminding him of the root to his just wed wife as if otherwise he would’ve lost the way(all laughs uncontrollably),then as he comes out,the lion jumps upon him to politely bark him(all brusts into laughter) to his grandpa,who was waiting patiently for his turn which was unfortunately he on the day(all brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(laughing) : “this no comedy can ever give you,Ketchum has really caught us all(all brusts into laughter)
Mehadi(laughing) : “he says he had to be extra careful to lick the boots of the old bear(all laughs) so that he doesn’t have to transfer all his pokemons that night itself playing the childhood-home and humility-despite-fame card that rather appeases the professor but he beaks his head off questioning about his pokemons and whatnot (all brusts into laughter) which on the backdrop of his Cerulian adventure is the most boring anticlimax (all brusts into laughter) anyway he somehow manages to get out only to be absolutely incensed to realize that that very momnet,the gentleman-looking-most-cunning fox named Trace(all uncontrollably laughs) is dreaming in the Pasio of Pasios with his flower(Daisy laugs out loud) while he was toiling hard to even get to his own flower this realization angers him extremely (all laugh) so he tells ganger to fetch the brat immediately (all laughs uncontrollably) which he tickllly obliges(all brusts into laughter) as the sweet sweet fox(all brusts into laughter) comes out he doesn’t know which side to sail to(all laughs) only managing to fire out the why drag all in bullet which by then he repeated so many times that he got angrier(all laughs) and fired in the canonball that all he wanted to do was to check the chemistry before parade(all laugh,Daisy shakes her head) which this fox wickedly shields (all laughs) by saying that they’ll not be his flower but follow suit always which stuns him so much that he resorts to the embrace-it-out option(all laugh) meanwhile Daisy again comes out with fhe groundbreaking declaration that she had evsdropped them(Daisy brusts into laughter,others follow suit) which as if was unknown to him(all brusts into laughter) and declares that why he was back whether he had spoken to yer younger lionesses (all brusts into laughter) etc to which he continues the sentiment card which Daisy doesn’t think she can handle for long(all brusts into laughter) thus tries to pull off his own trick on him(all laughs) by selling him the same wisdom nut he had earlier sold her(all brusts into laughter) saying that alright she admitted her baby Mehu went to him intentionally and would roam around him all her want for the rest of her life(Mehadi laughs,others smile)but she shouldn’t suffer for her devotion (all smile) which he rather ducks out(all laughs) but is again incensed again seeing her crooked man(all laughs) was enjoying his death all the while smirking and thinking of the final attack that’ll absolutely nail him down(all brusts into laughter),so to foild Daisy again from dragging him inside(Daisy laughs) he uses him to insinuate (all brusts into laughter) that his actions endangered his pokemons which this wicked fox jokes out(all laugh) and makes a comeback by advising him to phone around all from Brock to God(all laughs uncontrollably) which he then somehow bypasses only to be so incensed as this constant hindrence having pestered him for 15 hears whenever he wanted to adore his flower in complete seclusion(all laughs) and even today was upto his old tricks(all brusts into laughter)he using Ganger again creates an illusion to play a prank on Brock of all people who was most incensed with him and viseversa for trying to detach hia flower from him(all laughs)..by-the-way,sweet sweet Brock(all laughs) is in a real danger now which his sweet sweet Trace(all laughes) got into today again as he was  is flower(Mehadi blushes, other two smirks) snatching her away from the kitchen threatening his mom of robbing her pokemon (all brusts into laughter) and his 15 year long nemesis again had to choose the exact same time(all brusts into laughter) to insinuate that(all again laughes) he was his flowers BEST choice(all laughs uncontrollably) which as usual he started with sweeting the man only to call a false alarm and forcing everyone out of the home with the intention to have the grand lunch here today(all brusts into laughter) and has probably showed Trace all kinds of hell that he didn’t show me and rigourously proved to him about one being-two appearance-only for the illusion to break theory unless he truly has killed him(all brusts into laughter) which he will do as he now possibly has come to know the intricate details of each of those damn brats(all laughs) that had the audacity to even look at his flower(all brusts into laughter) while he wasn’t (all brusts into laughter) which includes unmarried females as well(all laugh) as due to him this brand if young has always been a constant problem for him(all brusts into laughter) to handle and according to him they tried many pranks to get his attention off from his flower(all brusts into laughter) as well as the threat that they might’ve influenced his flower rubbing her the wrong way(all laughs uncontrollably) so Brock being a constant encouragement of such brats(all laughs),his time is really numbered(all brusts into laughter) though hopefully in the last hours of night Trace of all people again to his utter disdain(all laughs) had the audacity to call him and insinuate (all laughs) that his actions weren’t right(all laugh)..and you know thank God that I snatched his phone away otherwise he would’ve again set Ganger upon on you(all laughes) and this was after he could give the ring(smile,blush) which if wasn’t the case Trace would’ve been in such hellfire that no vulture(all laugh) ever could’ve insinuated him out of it(all brusts into laughter)...then Trace rather idiotically forces her flower to compell him to call Brock to God(all laugh) at that time of night,and already these little Vultures insinuating around him if weren’t enough(all brusts into laughter) only for him now they had their dirty eyes on his flower’s beauty nap(all brusts into laughter) as well,so this sends him right into hell(all brusts into laughter) and I somehow managed to dissuade him from appearing on Ganger in Brock’s bed that very night(all brusts into laughter) and that too having known that even on that day Brock had the audacity to not only doubt him but directly causing his flower some pain on her first night by insinuating (all laughs) her that he doesn’t quite understand it,and this had put him out of his mind absolutely and he wanted to personally empty the whole Oak Lab pokémons on Cerulian and Brock(all brusts into laughter) and possibly on the whole world(all brusts into laughter) or may be alert the whole Elite4 to crush every vulture(all laugh) that ever appeared on Cerulian sky that day(all brusts into laughter) but he would’ve absolutely loved to completely devour sweet sweet Brock(all laughs) himself and I barely managed to calm the Gyarados of Gyradoses down(all brusts into laughter) only to tell him to phone-it-out(all laughs),which he obliged and started with telling Brock that he expected more help from males than females during his separation (all brusts into laughter) which to his utter disdain turned out to be the exact opposite(all brusts into laughter) making him absolutely loath every being on the planet apart from his mom and flower(all brusts into laughter),as Brock tried to make a sentimental comeback saying he hadn’t spoken for ¾ years,he just thunder chaired him off(all brusts into laughter) saying whether Brock was insinuating that(all laugh) he needed to announce to the world his longing for his beau(all laughs absolute uncontrollably)”
(few moments later,Mehadi lying down still has a fit of laughter,Daisy also laughes aloud,as we as Lillie)
Daisy(laughing) : “then Brock still had the audacity to challenge him to a rigourous insinuate-it-out(all brusts into laughter) which truly made sweet sweet Brock(all brusts into laughter) his biggest ever singular enemy ever imaginable(all again laughs)”
Mehadi(laughes) : “then suddenly Brock decided to connect with sweet sweet Viol of all people...(all brusts into laughter)..who started with screeching him names to which he politely pointed out that it’ll only harm her song performances (all uncontrollably laughs) which startled Viol so much that she(all laugh)said why was he not sleeping then(all brusts into laughter) to which he scoffed to Viol of all people that her beau was feeling lonely (all uncontrollably laughs) which again incensed Viol so much that she was about to go overdrive and just as she thundered the first b..(all laugh) he politely pointed out that at that moment the b.. is trying to dissuade Mehu flower form attacking him(Mehadi blushes,others pat her)..which truly threw Viol off her track(all laughes uncontrollably) buying him the time(all laugh) to growl at Brock why was he so incensed about the fact that he called him a lunatic un.. l.. r.. Infront of his then beau(all shakes their heads) and showed some fake documents (all shivering)..no wait this is what makes him the Pokemon  Master,as he fired these two both Viol and Brock went into overdrive,in the meantime he came back to quickly adore his flower once more(Mehadi blushs and laughs,others laugh),reminding his flower to not let the gentleman-fox(all Laughs) and his sinister flower(all laughs,Daisy Laughs out loud) mingle longer with her.(all laughs uncontrollably) and return to Brock to God to Viol(all laugh) that as he was saying(all laughs) he only did Viol the Greatest service of her life..and um..Dase this is what we’ve been wondering about that how can he be proved right even in this case..which utterly stops Viol as Brock then tries to make a insinuating comeback(all laugh) that what was he upto with Mehadi,to which he scoffs that why was he upset that while he gave Brock the chance to pick Viol flower which he happily obliged,Brock of all people never gave him the chance to pick up his Mehu flower,then as all was totally silent including God to Viol(all laughs) he growled at Viol that he sweared her husband out of his slumber for all wrong flowers to make him realize the right one and now Viol flower was insinuating (all laugh) to him that he will tear apart Mehu flower,whom he has gone through so many hells to get to(all smile),at which though Viol Flower didn’t like this constant flower business (all uncontrollably laughs) anymore,she had to admit that she’s so happy with Brock(all brusts into laughter) to Brocks abject failure to swear at the Pokemon Master..(all laughs)...now that Brock to God to Viol Flower all having calmed down the master played the master trick telling Viol to take rest as she had to fly out that very morning(astonished)..no I didn’t know either how he guessed that,to which he later told that a perfectionist like Viol when it comes to her performance would always be calmed down with that enough to get herself concentrated again by being distracted(all laughs) so he played a guess and suddenly that turned out to be right as he also thought otherwise Viol being Voil won’t stay awake at that time unless she had a plane to catch the very morning being a perfectionist (all brusts into laughter),the he himself sweet talked Viol off saying his pathetic 17 year journey(all laugh) has made himself rather detached from the world of art(all brusts into laughter) which he would like to rekindle may be sometimes later(all laugh) with the addition that he has travelled the whole world but whether Brock thought this Mantyke(all brusts into laughter) was the most artistic (all brusts into laughter) to this Brock was dumbfounded (all laugh) as Viol was very happy and went on to tell Brock how sweet her Mantyke was(all laugh),then congratulated Seth on his title and Mehu flower and got disconnected(all laugh)?
then he sweared Brock left and right basically telling him that a half-grown brat(all laugh) like him should’ve been the first to realize his heart-wrenching pain for his flower(all smiles,Mehadi blushs,giggles) and he did the exact opposite only by encouraging underground sludge to flow upto the ground and try desparately to reach his flower,and some portion of which had the audacity to challenge him during his Unova Elite4 battle by insinuating something(all shake their heads)..no Dase this is the only time I saw him angry and you won’t like to face it as yesterday just after he started to torture me I saw that same fire in his eyes when he instructed his pokemons to snatch mine away and if any brat human or pokemon disturbed him today despite Pikachu being there,he threatened his bunch to forsake them forever (all very concerned)..he told them not to kill any persons but if there were any pokebrat(all smile) misbehaving including mine,then to mercilessly kill them off(all shivering)after the first warning and he engaged his 4 pokemons to make sure I don’t have a heart attack or faint or any discomfort(all shivers) which um..well...Bulbasaur and all else were excellent and he sleep powdered me just at the right times and just enough to make myself calm down while I could hear and congnize,a pokemon did that like the most professional doctor(all wonder)..which he later said Bulbasaur being the eternal guardian to all, understood to some extent from body movements and inferred condition of humans now that he was always beside Gary as well,so he trusted him on this,and Bulbasaur behaved just like a human,which actually is Seth’s biggest strength that he knows he has atleast one of the 85 beings beside him all the time including Mime,that would be beside him till infinity (all smile)he told me many times that they too were his soulmates(all smile,  ehadi)...then I saw what sort of height pokemon master’s pokemons has reached all did things like a well trained Military with Snorlax bossing around the area and he was from Pasio and yeah he gave Seth the Hoenn league but only then isaw the might of him,that adorable snoring sleeping round teddy bear looked like he has gobbled up the whole world and has become its gurdian and sole responsibility.. and truly Lil, that little sweet Pikachu that plays around no matter what he did in Sinnoh or Kalos,this Pikachu’s was just burning as if nothing in the world could go past him that day no matter who they were or how many and as if he had become Seth himself,then that devillish determination to the goal to obey his master no matter what...(all wonder and shiver)..and the whole other lab pokemons were so disciplined and this was itself a false alarm as he told me..(all wonder)...as he later casually laughed it off saying Snorlax’s concern and Pikachu’s rage was enough for the rest of his own to follow suit and the others to properly behave all the while Bulbasaur and his Dark gang worked upon me without being disturbed by anything outside as if they’ve forgotten everything except me..Bulbasaur looked after me just as any professional doctor would do and his 3 dark types were at my nerves and somehow made myself feel a bit light just as I saw them each time as if they were trying to tell me why are you so concerned?you’ll get through this and then we’ll play around all we want...after each of his hellrounds one by one mercilessly tore my body apart...well,um..he started with swearing me then completely scoffed away..um..purity(Daisy&Lillie shivers)...Dase,what he did to me mentally and verbally,no h.. b... would be able to do that in their wildest dreams physically,he tore apart every bit of my body simply by swearing them off then came to my mind where every idea of kindness etc he mercilessly attacked...you can realize now what he was doing (all smile)..he just was desperately trying to take my focus away from body and sentiments and emotions to the soul and in the same process I was watching what he was doing to himself he was just thrashing himself to death before me and waiting for me to follow suit all the while his pokemons were robotically doing what they were told to...and I finally had my moment and we finally patched up when his jovial real self came out and that did what it did(all smile),that torture..unless one himself have gone through it several times and knows every bit of can subject another to that..and he was swearing me left and right to insult me at the same time he sweared me even more only to remind me that I had the strength to follow suit and he knows it...he had more faith in me than myself which actually..um..(blushes)
Daisy(smile,patting Mehadi) : “your own faith in his abilities when he first started out,just repayed you that(Mehadi giggle and blush)”
Lillie(smile) : “truly a Pokemon Master”
Mehadi(blush) : “yeah that’s what he told and you know why he told that and I just realized what Seth Ketchum had become...just like in Pokemon World,he doesn’t have any match in this world when it comes to control over his neves even when as he was dying and on that of any Pokemons...he in the meantime battled me to show his power,I was incensed enough myself,he got Gyarados of all for me,and used Bulbasaur who just stood there like a statue looking at Gyarados,who to my then worst nightmare..you know the best that in my own powers, Gyarados was just like the Master’s Pokemons if not more and that Gyarados despite me screaming my head off to flamethrow Bulbasaur,kept looking at Bulbasaur and Seth,then looked at me as if she couldn’t believe why she was out of the Pokeball itself,then just calmly lied down beside me,and i’ve barely seen her lie down and she did it while on the ground,which she hasn’t than more than once or twice before...I was scared to death as I couldn’t believe my most trusted sweety just left me at that moment..to which Seth just smiled and came and tendered her..and even at that point I saw,he was still the same playfull kid to Gyarados as ever,and my Gyarados looked at him with the same care that she has ever done to me if not more...then Seth recalled her again and that sweet tender Seth of mine whom I just couldn’t help but to fell for since the first sight(all tender Mehadi),just in a moments notice went to the next devillish hell and Bulbasaur nonchalantly returned to tender me as if nothing ever happened for Seth only later telling me,if he pushed himself to the limits he could control lenegdary pokemons at his will as well but not for a long time and he was at that moment hismself torturing him to death as well and then on my Gyarados of all pokemons,he just tamed her as if she was his soulmate too(all tears)...and I saw then his real power and slowly realized that none could rescue me from this demon except myself(smile,all else smile) and just went on;none can reach it unless he’s ferociously honest with himself that he can never harm any pokemons or their trainers no matter what his words and behaviour were and he told me if that was my Goldy, Goldy probably would’ve hugged him to death as he knew him personally for a long time..my Goldy would’ve been so assured no matter what was happening to me that he would cuddle my oppressor and it’s lunatic in normal condition but if Gyarados could do that,Goldy could certainly do that(all shiver and smile)..he told me his only concern when it comes to My pokemons is Dewgong as he is the Gym’s leader pokemon,he Seth can’t tame psychologically no matter what,but I was only happy cause no matter how strong Dewgong is,he would’ve been totally torn apart by the whole Lab pokemons that day if he didn’t budge at Bulbasaur’s first warning,as I only later came to know that he wisely gave me Gyarados and not Dewgong,cause he himself would have been able to stop all but Pikachu if Dewgong attacked Bulbasaur as Pikachu just about turned to Gyarados but Noivern,who was closely observing Gyarados,he didn’t come close as Noivern signalled him that Gyarados isn’t misbehaving,you can imagine what level his pokemons are at and all Bulbasaur did was to signal Gyarados that,Seth was trying to help me calm down only(smile,all smile),Lil,Dase when later he told me his pokemons are his soulmates I realized what he meant,it is a fully trained unmatched battelion except Pikachu and Mime who would go to any hell with him,Mime was spared for his Mom,though she can herself become pretty insanely unstoppable with all her psychic powers cause she alone has to defend Mrs Ketchum if she wished so and Pikachu’s temperament is that he is Seth’s big brother(all smile),so he would rather look after him than to follow him(laugh,rest smile) and this itself made him most dangerous to anything that Seth felt any threat from..”
Lillie(smile) : “yeah,Gary said he has never seen anything like a phenomena Pikachu has become,because Seth wont battle him again he’s upset and thinks his ‘lil bro has gone to the bushes(all laugh loudly) so he won’t talk with him much(all laugh hard), that’s why he keeps a bit distance from Seth since he has returned..”
Daisy(laughing) : “well he threatened his sweet sweet Trace today with Pikachu right Mehu?(all laugh)”
Mehadi(laugh) : “the moment he heard Trace,he screamed Thunder Chair(all laugh)..and Pikachu threatened Trace like nothing(all laughs)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “it’s unbelievable that how those little pests can threaten or fondle anybody according to Seth’s will and yet mean no harm,the first time he came back,as soon as Trace pronounces “Mehu” he brusts into “Thunderbolt” and Pikachu scared Gary and Trace to death by jumping on Trace only to scratch his nose(all laugh)politely(all laughs uncontrollably)”
Lillie(laugh) : “right,later we were told unless Seth really means it,Pikachu won’t even attack a single pokemon but Seth’s only concern is that if Pikachu is with him and someone puches him and something and he gets angry and gets involved but the opposition is more powerful or more in number for the Master to insinuate himself out(all laugh) and getting angrier and feeling physically threatened during a long skirmish,then if Pikachu is with him or near him or somebody brings him to Seth,even Seth can’t stop Pikachu from thunder chairing the whole world(smile)Grandpa’ said there’s no record of a Pokemon being able to judge his Master and even boss him around like Pikachu can do,so Seth calmed the brat(all smile) down saying he’s done many things for a long time why doesn’t he take rest at home(all laugh) and at the same time insinuating that Pikachu(all laugh) has become too lazy and wants to drink too much(all laugh) so Pikachu also got angry and conspiring with Mime and Ganger(all laugh) eat all his food, tickled him whole day whenever they caught him,and pestered him the whole night(all laugh),so the two brothers aren’t on good terms(all laugh) though they’re too professional (all laugh) to bring their personal matters(all laugh) to their business partnership (all brusts into laughter)”
Mehadi(laughing) : “mom was insinuating (all laugh) that if Ganger and those other two sinister dark devils(all laugh) has done something to Seth(all laugh) as she isn’t fond of Ganger(all laugh) as he pesters her as usual(all laugh) and Mime is too disobedient while Seth is around(all laugh),Pikachu isn’t talking with Seth(all laugh) and the other two unknown Devils that Seth has got straight from hell(all laugh) doesn’t seem to have saintly motives(all brusts into laughter)..to which I told her a bit of Seth’s supremely heightened ability and nerve control,to which she opined that he must be lonely then(all brusts into laughter),giving Seth the golden chance to re-insinuate(all laugh) her that she herself has just admitted that he can even infront of his mom adore his flower(Mehadi blushes, others pat her)”
Daisy(laughing) : “..all he wants and making a deal with Mrs Ketchum that unless he gets to fondle his sweet sweet flower all the time,Mime is going to circus(Mehadi blushes,others smirk and pat) with his sworn-in(all laugh) enemy,the gentleman-crook(all brusts into laughter)”
(few moments later)
Mehadi:”then after calming down Gyarados he again went on to torture me...and so on..anyhow when he looked that way scoffing at Brock,I felt scared to which he just pat my head(blush,rest smile) and told me that it was again his trash talking that’ll work,which did...Brock got infuriated to start that game which was exactly what he dragged Brock to and then you know the rest(all smile)..and about the sludges he told me that they went to Unova and no he never wanted to know about them or why they had come but could see them that they had some personal problems with him and they suddenly challenged him just before his E4 match as he out of irritation scoffed at them,which he calmly accepted just for Kingler to nonchalantly adore the sludge brands biggest strength Slobro to gleefully submit as if Slobro was her long lost best friend,and as sludges couldn’t believe what they just saw and,the public glare eventually lightened upon dark sludges for disturbing the Elite4 challenger who was a budding once ever enigma with his Kalos win itself..and sluges were such buffoons that they thought they could beat all Elite4 with with their lackies just because they won Kanto and Pasio around retirement (scoff)...sludges  being a well known enough for the stench emanating,it took Seth some trouble but still he managed to utterly fool around with Unova Elite4 in all departments and saved the sludges from public humiliation by changing their names and so on..yup Pokemon Master made his biggest enemies his absolute pets in no time by humility, actually triggering my depression to that worst turn only for he himself to rescue me(fondles her ring and Giggle,all group hug)..oh and on our first night he again praised the sludges that went to challenge him to Unova,saying he in that position would’ve done the same but he then just complained that the boneheads should’ve realized that not many people can win 6 leagues and then the last one with that kind of utmost nonchalancy and playfullness and that too after winning all 32 badges of that Region,(proudly)22 Badges in Unova,11 in Sinnoh,(looks at her ring fondly)winning the final as 1 vs 8,and these all are much later,Seth even before this has won 2 leagues and battle frontier(looks at her ring) with a few contest ribbons as well,and the boneheads did what they did...Seth said that they should’ve realized that may be none ever has fooled around in a league Final and just laughing his challenger off to defeat(fondly looks at her ring)...all these none has ever done this and they can’t from unless they were very honest to the core(all smile,. again),thus the sludges didn’t need to be concerned about their beaus’s former crushes at least as long as it was about him no matter what the press told about him,even if he had fondled the sludge’s beau ever,he has no jealousy about it and won’t pester his honeymoon at all(angry, others tender Mehadi)..and Dase,Lil,actually I realized what a disservice the sludges did to both of us,after that he praised the sludges to heaven for winning Kanto,which he himself could only reach upto the last 16(all smile)..(in a proud,tense voice) without telling the sludges that it was only Master’s very first and even with his catterprie the Master would’ve sludged the sludge’s sludge slobro on the very second day of his journey in his sleep...(.,other tenders Mehadi,calm voice broad and proud smile)and he even congratulated the sludges for being a two league champions and atleast having the guts to stand up for their beau(shivering voice,others smile) no matter how tough a hurdle Seth Ketchum posed(smile,tears,others pat Mehadi)...praising the sludges again,now he bore the dirt thrown yet saving the sludges from Elite4 wrath and public humiliation..then the sludges still don’t know what a grave mistake they committed,it could’ve been that very moment they could’ve been thunder-chaired to their adorable dreams(shivers)..by stating that they were straight from Cerulian seaweage...(shiver)..as they were so greatful that they wanted to be f.. around like all those h..b.. waiting at his feet all the time..(angry,tears,all pats Mehadi).(smile,Mehadi looks at her ring very fondly again)..and look at the Master’s heart even then,he complemented him saying he expected this from a Cerulian and that too being a two league champion and the City was near Pallet his respect has only increased to meet some real sludges like them straight from Cerulian drains(all laugh)..(laugh).. though now we know all about it..(all laugh)...but I didn’t understand it when the sludges returned and again was trying to stench my gym went so overboard just cause they were given the opportunity by the Master to have a coffee,thet they went on insinuating me if they were me they would’ve thrown themselvs at the Master’s feet all the time...(tears,kissing her ring again,all pats Mehadi)...no,Dase,Lil,after all this I can tell you why exactly I got so depressed and this was it...and the reason was the Master himself,and Seth started to torture me and just mouth off my purity from exactly this point(tears,again looks at her ring fondly)...I then just realized what Seth mercilessly told me yesterday that he had me for 13 years and had my whole mind and body totally scanned and I of all didn’t need to hide anything from him just like he himself,we grew up together(kissing the ring)..he never bothered about any physical closure with me despite knowing my devotion for him(sobbing)..and you yourself know what he says here...he told me that he was infatuated with me,attracted to me,and no neither did I ever notice anything except may be he kept his hands on my shouldrs a bit too long or held my hands a bit too long or gazed my face a bit too long with adoration...(all smile,. again)..and that’s all.he just liked to pass time alone with me that’s all.and there too,never went overboard about any compliments at all except the ‘you look cute’ or when he was my boyfriend would just pat my hands while saying that and that’s all...he never hugged me in any other way than a good friend does,not even when he was my boyfriend,not even the day we had our first kiss(tears,looks at her ring adorably, others pat)...never any more than that despite me only being his one nod away from getting all over him and especially all the time I saw him after his sinnoh miracle...and all we ever did then was to have one kiss,and that too he yesterday said was all his fault if he got weak like a h.. b..yeah said it to himself..that day and couldn’t keep to himself despite me not wanting that but may be ultimately agreeing to cause I got too emotional and he said may be he shamelessly took a chance on my warmth for him(tears,looks at her ring)...and he was my boyfriend,he knew how much I wanted him,still apologized yesterday if I wasn’t in the mood that day and he was a shameless..”
(tears,looks at her ring,others tears,pats her)
Lillie(tears) : “Mehu,i’ve now realized what he told me yesterday and why he was so nonchalant about it that he didn’t even bother to appologize,he knew what me and Gary meant to each other and he knew the past and he hit that point only to see if we’d still believe him to be just fooling around or not..we never would but I get his point now...if it was so strong why would you be too emotional no matter what,which I was..just laugh it off some times later.it’s still within family and all knew who you were including grandpa...(sobbs)..and we’ve known each other for so so many years that yes we’ve found our soulmates but its still at the end an extremely unique bond that we share may be even more than a family and that’s why nothing can topple it,nothing none would be bothered about,we are just too known too each other that even the very private life never mattered just that we don’t need to rigourously talk about it and that’s all,Mehu you can realize when he went on to the comparisons,he broke apart anything we might ever have felt about others in our darkest and weakest days,but now we were way ahead,but if that wasn’t yet cleared,the master would insinuate-it-out(all laugh)...(smile)that little brat trash talked us to his beloved hellfires to break any barrier that he felt were insinuating (all tears and laugh) something by totally mortifying himself and yes if he does that again we’ll do the same but..if you get me...”
Daisy(sobbing) : “he tore himself apart from us solidifing our bond by killing off any unimaginable Cerulian sludge(all tears,laugh) who may ever dare to vulture around(all smile)outside on in our mind itself  due to the past and the unique bond...all the while we loathed him to absolute hell,he just sweard off any reservations we could ever imagine”
Lillie(smile) : “no we don’t imagine that and that brat should’ve known it(all laugh) but he mercilessly thunder-chaired all unimaginable vultures(all smile) that made his own life a living hell,even before they dared to come into existence even mentally,especially as our children would grow up and new staffs would come in and all that...a change of guard...and most glaringly and that was his point he was about to do that himself,our soilmates would only get closer and closer..and all darkness would be sweared off to hellfire rounds where he would go too..(all laugh)that little obsessive self-destructive pest indeed is a new meance to personal space”(all brusts into laughter)
Daisy(smile) : “and this same thing he did to Brock,and now look at him...for all his qualities the vulture-killer(all laugh) sweared off his one mental barrier without knowing what it was but just doing enough insinuattion(all laugh) to Brock to insinuate-it-out(all laugh) himself...Mehu,we need your beau as well(all brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(laugh) : “and even if he went to hell yesterday,and many years later any vulture(smile) suddenly appeared in our wildest dreams,we would remember that merciless swearing-in ceremony (all laugh) so that the Vultures will again be proved that truly nowhere can they ever catch the Pokemon Master..(all brusts into laughter)”
Daisy(laugh) : “Mehu,in your trance travelling as soul,next time remember Vultures are always there(all brusts into laughter)”
Lillie(laugh) : “especially the godforsaken Cerulian breed(all again brusts into laughter)”…
(all laughs for a few moments)
Mehadi(smile) : “but you know he then told the sludges that their girlfriends were in safe hands and he wished them luck(all smile)..this he told me at night,so then I realized why those sludges was so overjoyed that day...(smile)....and Dase,Lil,even yesterday,even after giving me,his soulmate the engagement ring for which he totally mortified hismself for so long,but then making me feel his eternal wife just in hours,Seth still told me that if he never came,I would’ve been in safe hands(tears, looks at her ring fondly,others pat Mehadi)”
Daisy : “really Mehu,the sludges are really lucky that they ever even had a chance to meet a person like this”
Lillie : “yeah,and hopefully it gives them a better life” Mehadi (tears,smile) : “and also after I got to know his pokemons powers over nerves his own powers etc and this is after I got my ring, suddenly as if something had bitten him,some memory,he just forced me away from him and fervently apologized that if I ever think that he forced me to be with him using his powers and pokemons and something illegal that his association with the team rocket busting operation made him familiar with,he told me even then that if I thought so,he fervently apologies and even then(tears,smile,kissing her ring),even then told me if I thought he has got me back deceitfully,I can still leave him immediately,he will be doing whatever I tell him to apologize properly(tears, looks at her ring again very tenderly)..” Lillie(smile) : “Mehu,even if he has deceived you,you won’t get a better man in any lifves(hugs Mehadi) if there’s more than one...” Daisy(patting Mehadi) : “you know we never really thought Ketchum was the right one for you,never...I had my doubts till I heard that speech myself..no man or woman who doesn’t longed for his beau with all soul imaginable,can so intricately yet so nonchalantly say the things he said...after that me and Trace we just kept looking at each other then both smiled and Trace said that he never believed Seth and Mehadi could be separated since he saw them(Mehadi blush,Lillie smile,smile) he said that he had seen people fooling around and fighting in between to be close and all that but this fight was so sweet that he felt none actually ever wanted it to stop at all and would rather like to literally kill each other than to stop or be friends;this fighting just was an expression of their intense loging for each other all the time,simply because their longing for each other was so deep that they just at that age couldn’t help but to fight-it-out(all laugh) all the time to express that to each other that without the other they just can’t think anything,this longing was so intense for their 14 year selves,it was just impossible to grasp and manifest it...and I told him that I never believed in Seth but not only has he proved me totally wrong he has depicted to me,my own journey and longing for my soulmate so vividly yet so enjoyably that I would say I wish I was in those rounds again and again just to enjoy it again and again(all smiles)” Mehadi(smile) : “yeah,and when I then just scoffed at him when he was insinuating (all laugh) that I may think he was deceived me,he again went onto proving as to what was he doing, but this time very naïvely and again was about to play his hellfire rounds and this time it was more dangerous cause he wanted to show me that indeed he has cheated thus now he would again tear himself apart and let me see his self destruction till I got my answer,but this time I just gave a good scolding(all laugh) and he calmed down(giggle)” Daisy(smile) : “no Mehadi,he can get extremely ferocious upon himself if he feels that he has to show his soul to someone,get a lease on him(all smile) Lillie(laugh) : “Mehu,I was thinking that your beau is a sort of a person that if he caught you cheating on him,rather than doing anything else would totally destroy himself to see if he had any problems himself to begin with (all smile)...really get a lease on him and get this idea of having to prove every step logically so that none can insinuate(all laugh)anything,get this out of his head” Mehadi(laugh) : “yeah,but at present even I wouldn’t be able to cause sweet sweet Brock hasn’t even seen him yet(all brusts to laughter) and he has already declared his most intense longing for this beau(all brusts into laughter) of his,i’ll be there with him when he thunder chairs Brock(all laugh) cause otherwise for a person like Brock if doesn’t submit easily Seth will frequently appear anytime in his bedroom on Ganger(all brusts into laughter) and if we have our sweet sweet Viol Flower there(all brusts into laughter) by good luck,it’ll go out of hand as his Ganger himself is in the eternal hall of fame when it comes to tickling around(all brusts into laughter)..but as I was saying what he did after his encounter with the Cerulian sludge that actually started his antics and trash talks...he said he later kinda had an intuition that it might’ve been about me,but again at first he just brushed it off but then soon it made one permanent impression upon him as he himself was going through all hells then that no sludges no matter how f.. idiots they were would run after a man who not only could kill or snatch away all their pokemons literally but given his antics and popularity and mostly reach could even make their lives a permanent hell,why would they run after him as he never got remotely close to any woman except Mehadi and no herd of buffoons would chase after a man who was their girlfriends crush..so he soon realized it was about Mehadi indeed then also given the position of the sludges,and this name in itself itself just turned his head and forced him to tremendous hells as he remembered his Mehadi was so devoted to him deapite all popularity and he’d brush everyone aside no matter what came to his ears about me even after we broke up..and this yesterday he elaborately explained is a swearing-in(all laugh) that he never thought a Gym Leader like me unless herself budged,no vultures could touch her no matter what they would’ve achieved from outside but her core would remain as pure as ever...but then with his growing self realizations,these sludges did what they did,now he suddenly was all confused as of his Mehadi,what if he was wrong after all?what if she did out of desperation for himself did budge in the last days for someone and that’s why broke up?..you know,he tortured me yesterday to get this fact clear that he wouldn’t even look at any girl unless he had first broken up form his present girlfriend,when in a relationship,it just has to be honoured till break-up no matter how strainous it has become,only after the break up would he even look at any girl(tenderly cajoling her ring)...and so now, all those Vultures with there what ifs came around him and he was left totally bemused..but this really started his self mortification...he decided there was only one way to get rid of Mehadi completely and that is to find someone else as Mehadi might’ve done herself by now so that these sludges out of some irritation came to date him(all laugh)..then this made him most merciless because now look at how he went about finding his girlfriend (laugh,all wonder)..he would never look at anyone in a way he would do to his Mehadi,he just won’t do anything that he did with Mehadi but the exact opposite,and the only difference was that Mehadi came to him herself so to oppose that he had to go to girls and then scoff and swear his head off to them for no reason(laugh,Daisy&Lillie shakes their heads)...but obviously he couldn’t as that is absurd like going upto a girl by telling her ‘hellow!i’m Seth Ketchum,Pokemon Master’ and as soon as she say “Hi!” he would(laugh) go like   them and saying “yeah stupid b...”(all brusts into laughter)..so it was a huge difficulty...so he decided to do his antics and fuel his playboy images and as soon as any girl was too interested about him,they were sent right into(all laugh uncontrollably)..” Lillie(laugh) : “the hell with his beloved Vultures” Daisy(laugh) : “and their whole existence became a living insinuation(all laugh) that they were stupid b...”(all brusts into laughter) Mehadi(laugh) : “exactly this,this is the exactly the way he started with me yesterday,no matter what I did he just kept throwing me away(laugh)..when I sweard at him,cried at him,got angy,was depressed,about to have heart attack,wanted to hug him, confessed that he indeed was my only man ever, rejected him,wanted to be friends with him only or tried to forget him,longed for him,got myself killed to show I do want him and never wanted anyone else,got emotional,tried to kiss his head off(all laugh) ,even told him he was my soulmate anything I could imagine that I did,and no matter what I did,it became an insinuation(all laugh) that I had someone else in my mind but out of infatuation was trying to reconcile with him or i’ll be better off without him or I was an absolute coward that I was budging too easily or all I wanted was to be f.. around or even(all laugh ) I was kind,generous,warm, anything you can imagine all was an insinuation,when he admitted I only could read his soul,only showing it means is that he’ll instantly want to bed me(all laughs),I just couldn’t show him at all that I was indeed his Mehadi,to him-I was not his Mehadi’s replacement at all,no matter what,his Mehadi couldn’t be replaced and he was brutally showing it to his Mehadi herself(all laugh)...and it was me who he ever have had any feelings for,and finally till he could show me that state where it’ll be imbibed in me what real soulmate is,and even after that to prove words like chastity or ideas like bedding anyone meant absolutely nothing to him(all laugh)...really it wasn’t till I was on his same level of nonchalancy with anything that can be expressed or imagined,I never became his Mehadi,his Mehadi was he himself so I had to realize that Seth is also me myself.. only then the did the devil confess(all laugh )...and he intentionally preyed upon me yesterday (all laugh) cause my name was Mehadi(all brusts into laughter) and he happened to know me well(all brusts into laughter)...so you can understand what would happen to anyone if he didn’t know well at all(all laugh)..and to him now I realize knowing well was also defined by Mehadi(all laugh),that is till he knew everything about a girl for like 20 years(all brusts into laughter),he won’t consider her well known at all(all laugh)...and that’s why he decided,so when he saw that none were any match for even on the most basic s.. hurdle(all brusts into laughter),what to speak of it when he will tell them you’re my soul only to insinuate(all laugh)that it simly meant he wanted to f.. around(all laugh) and whatnot..he would tear apart every faith you ever had on kindness,gallantry,everything would become so garbage that he would basically tell you either you’re my girlmon(all brusts into laughter) or a stupid b..(all laugh)...and whatnot,finally if you passed all he’d start laughing at you that i’ll f.. around anybody except you all the time how about that(all smile)...you had to show him that you’ve grasped the fact that you were he himself..and that’s self realization so you can’t show it to him at all(laugh)..only if you went there and still came back and fully comprehend his absolutely carefree innermost self which he wanted yourself to understand as you yourself (all laugh)...he later told me,all he ever read or knew on philosophical things like this he desparately read more to have a grasp on what they may mean(all laugh),then went on with whatever he realized coupled with his own in-born beliefs to mercilessly mortify himself so that his Mehadi would appear from himself only(all laughs)...after we finally patched up yesterday he said exactly this,’i’d sit in a corner and you’ll go all about it,i’ll totally kill myself off and you’ll totally live all of it,but if you’re indeed the one then as soon as I kill myself completely,you’ll automatically appear exactly there(laugh,others smile and clap)...literally he had so much belief that that’s what soulmate would mean...” Daisy(laugh) : “and he’ll mercilessly describe this process again and again to you just like my sweet cunning man(all brusts into laughter)might still be self-learning(all again brusts into laughter). till he felt you can’t insinuate anything else (all laugh) to him at all,he won’t stop no matter what,Mehu,you’ve caught the greatest legend (all brusts into laughter)!” Lillie(laugh) : “that no goddamn vulturemade Cerulian pokedex(all laughes uncontrollably) can ever insinuate about(all brusts into laughter)” Mehadi(laugh) : “and Dase,Lil,this basic name calling hurdle is so extremely devilish that it itself will totally destroy any girl(all laugh) and he recharged me up yesterday so many times by swearing-in encouragements (all laugh)..yeah(laugh),he’d call you a b..,you’ll almost have a heart attack when he’ll tell to to stand up unless you’re a b..(all brusts into laughter)..and(laugh)..if you did manage to stand up,he’d tell you that you stood up is the very proof that indeed you’re a b...(all laughes uncontrollably) ...plus he engaged his pokemons to look after me and no wonder that’s all because it was his Mehadi,in his depth of soul he was indeed desperately longing to get me back,anyone else would’ve been volunteered to thunder-chair on the very first point when they couldn’t take it anymore(all laugh)along literally with their godforsaken pokebrats(all laughes uncontrollably),had they too misbehaved by trying to obey their master(all brusts into laughter), and especially so as the Master’s very own mad tempered big brother(all laughes uncontrollably) was sternly told that he’d not see his sweet little bro(all uncontrollably laughs) ever again,sending him to his most sinister mood(all laughs) pikachuable(all uncontrollably laughs)...and you remember that girl Serena-(laugh)the Master doesn’t make one scene till she doesn’t get on the ship cause he doesn’t want her to miss it and there itself create a scene after being ceremoniously inducted into the hall of b..(all laughes uncontrollably)..then smiles to his other friends(all laugh) whose reactions he describes as ‘the just crowned Kalos prince has just tasted and just smelt the just perfect Kalos stool’(all laughes uncontrollably)...then Seth said for the first time in his life he was in the wasroom for 40 minutes(all laugh) where he spat everywhere and puked his head off(all laugh) then come out and still never made any scene till it was his time to say goodbye,when in his language he sweetly smiled to his friends who thought “Kalos Prince has been princely spat upon”(all uncontrollably laughs) but then to their unimaginable disbelief (all laughs) the Prince sweetly (all laugh) tells them just that,that he has a girlfriend and he’s going to tell her what just happened,if they can save Serena(all uncontrollably laughs) then sweetly greeted them goodbye(all laugh)...this was his exact view of anyone that ever tried to mingle with him too personally or physically...and then even more brutally(laugh)..Seth described as he didn’t react,Serena thought that the Kalos Price is thinking that ‘Ah!what a cough,what a spit’(all laughes uncontrollably)...so when he tried to phone her first,she doesn’t pick up(all brusts into laughter)...only to make the Kalos Prince to follow his big bro meticulously(all brusts into laughter)...so he texts that he wants to declare his longing for his beau(all brusts into laughter)..and that he’ll anyhow have to confess (all brusts into laughter) on e day...so finally,that girl then was phoned as soon as he got down and just as she was in cloud 9(laugh),picks up the phone(laugh),Seth sweetly says,’Serena it’s Seth(all brusts into laughter)’,as if to gauge if it was anyone else or not(all brusts into laughter)..and then you can imagine that girl’s joy(all laugh),she just about stutters ‘umm..’(laugh)..Seth goes, ‘thanks for the urine’(all brusts into laughter)and then told exactly these things with the fact that as he was her dream since age of 4,she must be an in-born b..(all laugh)meaning if there were previous lives this was what she was,by soul she was a b..(all laugh),and that meant she is solely why there’s a word called b..(all laughes uncontrollably) and as if the girl could insinuate (all laughes uncontrollably) any return with the promise to be changed,enter Prince’s beloved girlfriend-the soulmate theroy(all laughs uncontrollably)..now he set his girlfriend upon on the sweet sweet girl(all laughes uncontrollably) to meticulously but mercilessly (all brusts into laughter) unvulturize (all brusts into laughter) the fact,that she was the textbook eternal b..mate(all laughes uncontrollably) to anyone she’ll ever meet across all lives,as now she has just been immortalized as a b..(all shakes their heads and laughs),permanent existence across whole eternity(all laughs)...you can imagine what kind of insurmountable hell the poor girl was thrown in now that her soul itself has become a b..(all laughs)...and this is exactly what the Master did,just literally killed her off without any chance of any resurrection...(all shakes their heads)...and that’s only the beginning (laugh),just after cannonizing the poor girl(all laugh),his parents were informed in exactly this language?”i thank you wholeheartedly for allowing your daughter to travel with us throughout Kalos,your daughter has been very nice,a true s..,a great s..”(all laughes uncontrollably,shaking their heads)..yes exactly this which startled her parents to all hellfires they’d ever come across buying the Master the precious time (all laughs) to narate what she did and finally and most brutally telling them that a half grown s.. like that shouldn’t be allowed to roam around the world before cutting off(all shake their heads and laugh)...this requires Professor Oak and his mom’s personal intervention to give the poor girl and their family who were thrown into literal eternal hell to have any chance of resurrection which is scoffed off to hell again (all laugh) in the presence of his own mom,when Seth says he’s been cheated on his trust and humiliated in public by an eternal s..(all laugh),if they’re telling him to reconcile,his only message is that for a playboy with his name and fame and reach and power to be concretely blamed upon would require an immediate biological proof(all shivers) which the subjects can analyze to get the meaning of(all shivers)...Dase,Lil,this is said in the presence of his own mom with utmost nonchalancy and you know he never saw his own father,no matter how great a man his father was,which he himself is very much aware of,you can understand what unimaginable level of self belief and dignity a man needs to do this...even pointing to his very own mom two things,that whatever she told him about his father he believes un absolutely and at the same time if it’s not true,she,his own mom to him is exactly in that category for him...(all shivers)...and you know he says his mom is his soul...still at that moment for truth he was even willing to judge that as well...” Daisy(shakes her head) : “this is all too much... truly a legend across all hellfires unimaginable” Lillie(solemn) : “and you see Dase,this you no matter what, can erase off from the Master’s memory or can make him budge cause he himself says that he has felt this eternal hell himself as he was cheated on his trust so much that he even insinuated an eternal hellfire to a woman like Mrs Ketchum,his own mom...and the world may crucify him for this,he won’t budge as his defence is true to himself and for all to see no matter what others interpret it as...he won’t spare himself before being honest to himself...and that too no matter what hellfire he insinuated his mom,she would know deep down she’d also know what an unique gem she has unearthed (all smile)..long live Seth Ketchum(all laugh feintly)” Daisy(laugh shaking head) : “and this legendary meance(all laugh) would’ve brutally fallen upon the whole humanity with his now power and reach and his 84 sinister soulmates(all laughes uncontrollably)including his lunatic big brother(all brusts into laughter) to induct(all laughes uncontrollably) the whole world population to the thunder-chair of swearing(all laughs)and if in the process their pokebrats(all laughes) tried to misbehave(all brusts into laughter),the chair would become literal for them as the sweet insane big bro(all laughes uncontrollably)was battle-starved to unpikachuable desperation (all laughs uncontrollably) for his next prey(all laugh)...unless all persons meticulously started out to find their respective soulmates,all the while logically showing every step(all brusts into laughter) as uninsinuable (all laughes uncontrollably) for sake of their own well being(all laughes uncontrollably) including their pokebrats (all brusts into laughter) by means of the legend’s own self mortification(Mehadi brusts into laughter,Lillie laughs shakes her head) to prove that no,not even the greatest eternal vulture(all laugh) can insinuate (all laugh)in any time across eternity,that the legend or his beloved followers (all laughes uncontrollably) wasn’t honest with themselves(all laugh)..had it not been for his only sweet eternal weakness (all laugh,Mehadi blushes and laughs) to get depressed to such hell that even the legend had to budge finally(all laugh) giving the whole population a desperate relief (all laughes uncontrollably) to only focus on getting back his eternal Mehu flower(all laugh) from any unimaginable hell but through them all(all laughes uncontrollably) to the eternity where he roams around...Mehu,you’ve become a legend too(all laughs)” Lillie(laugh) : “and Mehu,the legend has laughed and sweared off you depression too(all laugh and clap)” Mehadi(laughes) : “..and I got every bit of this legendary swearing in yesterday (all laughes uncontrollably) when I was his eternally beloved only flower(all laughes)..I can see what any random sludge from the world population had to go through(all laughes uncontrollably)...long live the depression (all uncontrollably laughs)” Lillie(laugh) : “I can now understand why this legendary brat(all brusts into laughter) can so nonchalantly insult absolutely anyone...” Daisy(laugh) : “and Brock’s then girlfriend faced the absolute full wrath of this uninsinuable legend(all laughs uncontrollably) who eloquently showed her(all laughes) Brock’s anatomy(all laughes uncontrollably) on their 2nd date(all laughes uncontrollably) and instantly flew off to any hell unimaginable(all brusts into laughter)” Lillie(laugh) : “and Brock realizing this anatomy totally got straightend finally but didn’t realize that this was the exact upended form of the Master’s anatomy of his eternally cherished Mehu flower(all brusts into laughter),and got so incensed that he volunteered to commit the biggest ever mistake in all eternity (all laugh)by encouraging sludges to float upon ground(all laugh) and that too had to be the from the Cerulian drains(all brusts into laughter)” Daisy(laughes) : “and if a moment of emotion can condemn you to eternal hell along with your whole family,May God Save Brock eternally(all laughes uncontrollably)” Lillie(laugh) : “Mehu,how did the girl and the family made a return?” Mehadi(laugh) : “through all hells(all laughes uncontrollably)..when he went to Kalos they tried to meet him,but obviously the Master had realized that these godforsaken brats(all brusts into laughter) may pester him again here(all laugh)...so he resorted for the sake of his free roaming to Charizard of all(all brusts into laughter) along with his unshakable doctor of all kinds Bulbasaur(all laugh) and his sinister big bro(all laughes uncontrollably),and all while having the eternal fool around champion Ganger(all brusts into laughter),a demon straight from hell like Noivern(all laughes) and the 2 utmost eternal brats like Feraligator(all laughes) and Crawdaunt(all laughes uncontrollably)..for air,land and water travel(all uncontrollably laughs)...if this wasn’t good enough(all laughes) when he was in public glare as they might’ve tried to pull any stunts on him(all laughs)he threatened the whole Elite4 to empty the whole area wherever he went(all laugh) or else he’ll intentionally lose all rounds and later accuse them of not providing the right safety measurements(all laughes) and if even this wasn’t enough then there was none other than our beloved Muk(all uncontrollably laughs)of all pokebrats (all brusts into laughter), hiding all the time in dark corners behind Seth(all laughes),which he intentionally chose to be at(all laughes uncontrollably),lurking for any female brat(all laughes uncontrollably) to breach a 3 foot specified circle (all laughes uncontrollably) to hug upon her mercilessly(all brusts into laughter)...and if even this wasn’t enough the Master used his ultimate weapon by stating that he is getting married just after this championship finishes(all laugh) and thus wished if females behaved properly with him he would be happy (all laughes uncontrollably)...yes he said exactly this...as he has been humiliated in public before by many who hasn’t been taught or was too ignorant in the class(all brusts into laughter) to differentiate between a brother and a beau (all laughes uncontrollably)..yes this he said and has shown me a copy of it cause he loved that antic so much which totally put anyone way off him(all laughes uncontrollably)...thus the poor family couldn’t catch him(all laugh)...then ultimately he went to Pasio, where his mind was a bit more disturbed as our sweet sweet gentleman(all laughes uncontrollably) had made life hell for him there all those years ago and as this legendary nemesis had the audacity to call him(all brusts into laughter)as Gary,who only was authorized to contact the master cause to him,Gary is the only person in the world who knew how to be most professional and least personal (all laughes uncontrollably) perfectly that charmed the Master’s mood most(all laughes uncontrollably),but as Brock to God would have it the day(all brusts into laughter) he reached the island where a godforsaken brat of a gym leader (all laughes uncontrollably) to his only blame caught too much attention of the Master’s blossoming flower(all laughes)in her teenage dreams(all laughes uncontrollably) unfortunately for her not to realize that after all her antics for two years(all laughs) finally had inducted her to the central attention of the Great Master(all laughes uncontrollably) apart from  his mad bro(all laughs uncontrollably)...for the first time in 2 years (all laughes uncontrollably) the Master suddenly felt a little tickle(all brusts into laughter) in his soul(all laughs) that his flower trying to flow (all laughes uncontrollably) to the wrong side(all brusts into laughter)...and if that memory at that time wasn’t good enough this same full grown brat(all brusts into laughter) Danny now was the one to harshly remind him of his flower(all laughes uncontrollably),whom he instantly realized to be indeed the Master’s eternal beau(all laughes uncontrollably) and thus only wanted to ask  the the Master if he has married her or someone else as the master had announced in Kalos(all brusts into laughter)...now as if all the names and memories wasn’t enough suddenly comes marriage(all brusts into laughter) to make the Master surpass his big bro(all laughes uncontrollably) and just as the poor guy was about to be thunder-chaired,our sinister gentleman(all laughes uncontrollably) called him(all laughes uncontrollably) after many years as Gary wasn’t there on an emergency and despite reminding the gentleman that the great master may call or have to be called and then just to tell him to wait and give it to the main staffs,with whom master consented to deal as they didn’t pester him after his stern insinuation (all laughs) via Professor Oak,this good gentleman(all laughes) suddenly remembering his long lost beau(all brusts into laughter) wickedly asks (all laughes uncontrollably) him to tell him the island’s name(all brusts into laughter)...and that was it(all Laughes uncontrollably)...the gentleman was told that the master was already dealing with many people who can’t let go off certain personal issues only to remind him of it without realizing whether those were still fond to him or not(all laughes uncontrollably)...yes he said that to slaughter Danny completely...and now a man who suddenly breachs his agreement with his reservation Lab taking chances on his old contacts him,if these continues,he’ll have to surrender all his pokemons and titles and badges and go back to being someone who hasn’t heard the word Pokémon...this makes all parties to get absolutely slaughtered and startle Danny to all hells as to why this sweet sweet man,whom he couldn’t forget in 14/15 years due to his utter clueless personal life(laugh) turning into an absolute enigma once he had to battle where thouhh then dormant yet an once ever flavour of unimaginable intuitive power shown through or his eternal flower(all laughs),who at that age just couldn’t express properly what she was had inside for the master(laugh, others smile and pat Mehadi) thus resorting to various antics(all brusts into laughter),which all but the Master himself understood(all laughes uncontrollably),this sweet man was so gentle and behaved so warmly with him even after being reminded of that how famous a Gym Leader his flower had become(all laughs),which he then politely scoffed of as saying that yes,his flower was always excellent with water pokemons(all laughs) which though then didn’t get Danny going then but he misunderstood the Master totally in this regard (all laugh),now as the Master salughtered him and his gentleman(all laugh),he finally realized that the Greatest Master will become the Greatest Legend(all laugh) if the name Mehadi Waterflower or her deeds was personally attached to him beyond friendship(all laughs)...so both Trace and Danny flew off to whichever hell they first saw(all brusts into laughter)...but during this all,to the greatest disdain to Master, suddenly these ‘stools from Kalos’(all laughes) appeared as having the misfortune to be relatives to Danny(all brusts into laughter)...they appeared im front of the Master but thank God they and their pokebrats (all laugh) behaved as brother than beau(all brusts into laughter) and now the Master couldn’t say anything to humiliate Danny,thus later agreed to meet them personally,given the condition of 3 foot circle(all brusts into laughter) and not trying to make themselves or their pokebrats the cherished food for his starving big bro(all laughes uncontrollably) and if this whole Elite4 feared infamous big bro wasn’t enough(all laugh) as Seth knew that no matter what,he or his bro doesn’t actually want to hurt anybody and that too to people who weren’t at all proficient beyond the very common level when it came to Pokemons or their handling and though Serena travelled with him and could become a trainer which she is now and in Unova,the whole Elite4 combined was a child’s play to the Master,so to his actual defense he used the his most unholy aoulmate(all laugh),his now right hand tickle master(all laughes uncontrollably),invisibily present on the 2nd foot in front of him(all laughes uncontrollably),which simply means death from laughter(all laughes uncontrollably) to even Suicune (all laugh)..and Seth then sternly tells them before anything that no matter what emotion may do,she should’ve realized that he ever behaved to her as a big brother and to him she was a little sister and she broke his trust only to insult herself and her family,to which the girl fervently apologized which was scoffes off as you know(all laugh) insinuation to get close to him again(all laugh)...this turned her family on who were thrown into hellfire as they accused of being egotistical b.. as that’s exactly why they think he suits their daughter (laugh,all shakes their heads)...Dase,Lil,this is living hell if there’s anything ever...which made all of them to totally break down...but this statement bought him(laugh,rest smile) the time to show his same insane level of generosity which is exactly why the girl and their family couldn’t forget him or anyone else ever can no matter what he did to them if they’ve seen his heart...he basically babysit this girl into maturity and made other friends in Kalos to realize what life really is all about and taught the girl about pokemons,so now she finally realized what big brother she misunderstood as she’ll never have one like him in all hells(.,all smile)....(laugh,all wonder)..so now Seth finally showed them his true self telling the girl that she can keep im touch with Professor Oak,which all of her family was and just as she had started to do continue her journey through Kalos and learn about herself the most which’ll be enough to interpret the world including that of the Pokemons(all smile,Mehadi again looks at her ring) and telling the family this time the rout out of the eternal hell as well saying ‘pardon is bestowed only by own soul,not by anyone or anything else’(all smile,Mehadi looks at her ring tenderly) and simply walked off but(laugh) not before the tickle master suddenly became visible just infront of the girl(all brusts into laughter) like so many times he did to scare her in Kalos(all lauhh), to ultimately showing the Master’s true fool around nature and simultaneously telling everyone that this hell was only to get the girl straightened forever(all smiles,Mehadi looks at her ring tenderly) and how lucky they’re to even have the sight of this once ever Legend(all smile,Mehadi adores her ring)...and then later as Seth finally decided to raid me(all laugh),he gave me all this information briefly in his note to me,which according to my sweet Viol flower couldn’t ever be romantic(all brusts into laughter) and tell her to phone me and Dase,Lil...the Master showes his Mastery again and what level of faith he had on himself and on his only weakness in this world(smile,all smile),that even after all that and 4 years of no contact and his history with Serena and Me and my depression and may be alleged after break-up affairs and all that,he tells the girl if she wants to meet a real Lady who could ever match her idea of Seth(all smile) in all quarters,she may call me after she gets to know from the Hall of Fame for Water Pokemon Gym Leaders who Mehadi Waterflower is and her contact s(all smile,all pats Mehadi) with the note that he even broke-up with me long before he stepped foot in Kalos and only recently had to meet her formally(laughes,all smile) due to his and her positions (all laugh,Mehadi shows her ring and giggles)...and knowing full well he was the centre of my full wrath then(shows her ring,all laughs) and this poor girl could be again resent hell(all laughes uncontrollably)...but such was his faith that his conscience was clear with both me and what he did to all in Kalos that despite his playboy image which Serena was very familiar with as the press said and all he knew he truly is uninsinuable (all smile) no matter what happened and his faith even then on me that Mehadi may’ve found someone else but or even have cheated on me just before break-up but i’ve also seen her devotion to a no-one despite her fame and skills and indeed it might be mine and my image which I didn’t clarify forced her into that and still then she atleast broke-up rather than showing me her new beau(all laughs)..and even further he had the unflinching faith that no matter what i’ll still behave properly with her as he has seen and known how I never even was rude but only very firm with all those that pestered me..Seth remembered me for all the right reasons only and always(looks at her ring,others smile and pats her)...” Lillie(laugh) : “Mehu,this legendary pest(all laugh) all along wanted you with unfathomable longing and devotion yet won’t ever ask for a date or tell his friends about it(all laugh)” Daisy(laugh) : “as it’ll be an insinuation(all brusts into laughter)that she is all about bedding to him(all brusts into laughter)..Mehu,this eternal legend would’ve literally killed himself immediately yesterday had he not found his Mehadi in you(all brusts into laughter)..cause that would’ve been the last resort to see his real Mehadi...(all smile)..and exactly here the self-destructive Legend once more Masterfully shows what soulmate really is(all smile,. and giggles)” Mehadi(laugh) : “and then the girl probably had followed suit(all brusts into laughter) after knowing my details as when she called me,she was trying her hand at that(all brusts into laughter)...I told her why was she so upset,we’ve had absolutely no contact for 4 years now except a few days ago when he came here...(laugh)..and see how the Master played both me and Serena,if I told her Seth is a cheat and he humiliated me,she would’ve believed in it and cut off from him,which saved him from her forever(all laugh) and at the same time throwing me to further hells as I knew he might’ve cheated on me but he still has shown me what this exact girl did to him and what she is doing now and this girl was with him after our break-up and was there when the press was going all about him..and also knowing that he humiliated me and broke into my room but that sinister note and all that and he did no physical harm to anyone or anything and even my Goldy of all insisted Pikachu can’t do any harm to anyone ever(all smile)..my Gym Leader Dewgong told me they just didn’t know what to do and nothing happened to them at all,my Gyarados of all told me she was only happy(all brusts into laughter)..and my Viol flower(all laughes) told me,this isn’t a reconciliation note,he wants something else may be something is bugging his conscience(all smile)...and with all that I realized he infact in public humiliation, humiliated my depression away(., others pat her and smile)...and even if he did cheat,he still shown me his heart by driving my mental demons away,so with all that no matter what I would be dishonest to myself if I berate him and even if the girl cut off,her life itself will teach her how true each of the Master’s words were no matter how much her trust from everything broke,the Reality is reality and the Master again by self humiliation and mortification would at the end of her life show her that no he is uninsinuable (all smile) and also to me that whatever Seth Ketchum may have become,in my most desparate moment,he repayed me my faith and devotion to him while tearing himself apart from me by the veil of public humiliation,(tears,looks at her ring)as if your Seth is cruel to humiliate you in public but Mehadi,you’ll see i’ve only helped you(tears,fondles her ring)...”

this just for one moment of emotion,which I myself was so close to when I parted him first time(blush,all smile),which he himself later insinuated out of me(all laugh),and Serena has spoken with me, she’s as sweet a girl as you could imagine..and this was her treatment all cause he always showed her he was her big brother thought she finally realized,but when he was brutally proved wrong,he became the monster he showed me yesterday...and she called today morning as just after his Pasio Elite4, Serena’s dad and all personally came to patch up,for which first they were told they were only after him cause of his name and fame then finally they said no she really means it,she has changed and whatnot,then he finally said he had a girlfriend whom he had broken up but still wanted to patch up but wasn’t sure,in the meantime this b.. did what she did..and all this was because Professor Oak personally was involved...so she got a chance with the fact that if he ever got back to his girlfriend,she can do whatever she wished with her,that girl still didn’t budge so when finally she could get to me,who was fed her name so that she got even more insulted,was crying like anything to me making me totally dumbfounded,and he told her that he decided to break up but still a b.. like her needed to apologize if she had any whatever left in her and whatnot...and she was like so sorry you can’t imagine...just for one moment he mercilessly beats down a truly good person and family...you can understand what he became just before finally getting me”
Daisy(patting Mehadi) : “just too too fond of his Mehu flower(Mehadi blushes and hugs Daisy),too sweet..”

...and he said that that he had me at his mercy,the head-turning Cerulian water queen who was cherished by all Vultures of all breeds(tears) at his mere mercy even when he was a no one and you know people started to pester me as soon as I learned to use Gyarados,for which the Master always has praised me to all heavens and even to his own mom once more today(looks at her ring again gently,all smile patting Mehadi,tears)...so Seth just mercilessly tore apart my body while doing the same to himself by saying he was a unique man even then that such a girl was devoted only to him and as soon as the sludges insinuated (smile) that,I rememberd then as Seth again scoffed at me,that a then no-one like him needed only a nod or smile to get the Water Queen all over him(looks at her ring again,others pat Mehadi)..and you know how true it was when he returned from Battle Frontier itself,and compared Seth,the one and only man with whom i’d ever even imagine in my wildest dreams to be physical but also with whom i’d lose every bit of purity I can ever imagine if he so wished(all tears,Mehadi looks at her ring with fondness)...where my man stood with his behaviour fully knowing who his girlfriend was and what she wanted,that Seth with what these sludges were saying(tears,kissing her ring again very fondly)...and then the sludges got what they long deserved and I realized that it won’t be so easy to erase Seth off so easily and I went into the death fight with myself,which eventually only Seth realized with along with his own realizations and look,half a day and I like have been his wife forever(all tears,Mehadi fondly looks at her ring again)

just as he told him..and then told went in saying get a hold on his nerves and don’t get involved with unnecessary skirmishes and your girlfriend is very lucky to have you(all tears)..yeah(tears)..he said that as you know I too came to infer..(all tears)...and the sludge just got so dumbfounded that Brock was scoffed to hell...and Lil,even after giving me the ring he still told me,even after all that,that I would’ve been in safe hands(brusts into tears)…

he’s from Kanto,that name

Lillie(smile) : “and Brock too I guess is his pet now?” Daisy(laugh) : “and Viol..(all laugh loudly)
Daisy(laugh) : “the way he told Viol to also keep her pokemons fresh look after her family and all that so amusingly as if our own elder brother was saying but the language was so funny that you just laughed yet firmly got his message,Viol probably is his biggest fan now(all laugh)”
Lillie(smile) : “Mehu,you were talking about chastity,Gary last night told me Seth ,once when 11 scoffed at some guy who was 16 or so on a party or kinds thing when he was insinuating Seth(all laugh) that he should talk with girls and so on,that 11 year old brat suddenly scoffed “what’s the point if the difference persists?” flustering all,which finally he showed all of us what he meant that day,Gary ever daid that was the real Seth..Gary said Seth was the most ordinary guy,and you’d know Mehu(all smile),and Gary even says this pokemon master as well isn’t a big thing etc..I only just about realized what Gary can’t say in words,the Master Brat(all laugh) insinuated(all laugh) the soulmate thing extremely well at 11..but then it was just 1 year(Mehadi blushes,all smile)”
Mehadi(laugh) : “I can tell you now just due to Seth,when I said yesterday you’re a cheat,he went on with that chastity thing mercilessly showing me that it means nothing to him and at the same time showing he didn’t cheat on me till our break up..I was so stuttered then he said why would you budge even if your body was paralyzed, won’t the mind work,totally laughing off this most private matter of women just as if it was absolutely nothing to him..(laugh) then he showed dying in battlefield and giving a friend a glass of water which he can’t reach due to his sitting position in the table was exactly same as they were luck,which again a word that his Vultures love(all laugh)..he says the joy of pokemon was all he knew and did that’s it.... totally driven by intuition...Seth Ketchum really needs me to survive here(all smile)”

[Gary enters 10 minutes later,and meets Lillie,Lillie hugs him suddenly] Gary(bit surprized hugs Lillie) : “um..Lil.. what’s up?” Lillie(laughing) : “Ketchum has caught me as well” (all three sisters brusts into laughter)
Gary(bit puzzled) : “um..I see,hey all..happy to see you..hey Mehadi..what was it..” Lillie(laughing) : “he has insinuated about our private life to everyone(all sisters again brusts into laughter)” Gary(flustered,smile) : “um..what’s he..”
Mehadi(giggling) : “Lil can I be him?”
Lilllie(laughes) : “be my guest,Dase start insinuating(all three again brusts out into laughter)” Gary(nervously, confused) : “what are you..”
Daisy(laughing) : “so Lil and Gary turned out to be the best fit for each other after all,ain’t it Mehu?” Mehadi(laughing) : “sweet,sweet Dase(all sisters brusts into laughter)..” Gary(flustered) : “what are you three upto?..come on Lil,I have to..” Lillie(forces Gary to sit down,sitting with him as well) : “just watch it and laugh yesterday out(all sisters laugh)” Gary(bit shocked) : “um..that..”
Daisy(laughing) : “um..but really don’t you think that their recent tension was just due to a confusion among..”
Mehadi(laughing, immitating Seth) : “sweet sweet Dase(all 3 again laugh),why is it that I smell a few vultures cycling above us(all three again laughs,Gary smiles as well)?
Daisy(laugh,mocking confused state) : “um..fine they were perfect for each..” Mehadi(immitating Seth’s frown,all laugh) : “what was that Dase?do you imply that it’s as if they Became perfect,became right,became together,became..(all laugh)” Daisy(laugh) : “um..but when they first met..”
Mehadi(laughing,closed eyes, immitating Seth) : “Dase stop just there,I know what you’re thinking Dase I know it,I can feel the vultures,Dase, they’re trying,trying so hard to land on a spot(all laugh),they are so ecstatic about there success..Dase..I can feel their joy..I..I can see their eyes,Dase,Dase(all laugh)they are already feeling their impending success,Dase,look how they are caressing the Champaigns..(all three brusts into laughter)”
Gary(laugh) : “what’s Seth been upto off late now?” Daisy(laughing,mocking a sigh) : “fine,they were always to become close..” Mehadi(laughes, Mocking Seth’s smile) : “so they were to ALWAYS to BECOME close?..Dase this..just this(all laugh)..this is it..(Mocking Seth’s frown and language) “ the vultures have reached their spot..(Mocking smile)Dase,look at the celebrations..Dase..(all laughs again)..” Gary(laugh) : “come on you, I don’t..”
Lillie(smile and stops Gary) : “just enjoy it,let the vultures do your work”(all 3 laughs) Mehadi(laugh,mocks Seth’s stern look) : “the vultures would insinuate that if they waited a bit more,a bit longer,a bit patiently,a bit meticulously..(all laugh again)..then it Could’ve been someone else,Could’ve been someone better, Could’ve been someone sweeter..(again all laugh)” Gary(laugh) : “I get it.. Seth changed from trash to sweet..”(all three sisters laugh uncontrollably) Daisy(laugh, immitating sigh) : “alright,fine,they were always destined to each other..” Mehadi(laugh, immitating Seth’s scowl and irritation and anger) : “Destined?Destined?Destined?Destined?(all laugh)..as if it they never knew,never saw,never felt,never understood,never..(all laugh again)” Daisy(laugh,again Mocking sigh) : “ok,ok..they were forever like like this like soulmates,no matter what they’ll always come together” Mehadi(mocking Seth’s closed eyes and smile,laugh) : “Precision, Precision”(all laugh) Daisy(mock dissapointment,laugh) : “Please let me go..they were like this forever...” Mehadi(mocking Seth’s anger) : “what did you say?forever?forever?forever only having the trouble to come to each other whereas that itself is no good as the Gym is forever packed during shows(all brusts into laughter)..no don’t try to leave,Dase,else Ganger will tickle you to death..(all brusts into laughter)..(again mocking Seth’s anger) all those damn brats that ever had the audacity to challenge Gary’s little sweet cherished flower to a gym battle at 4:17 in the morning with an Onix(all brusts into laughter)..must very well know it, understand it,digest it,swallow it, assimilate it(all again brusts into laughter)..that it’s not then, it’s not now,its not will be, it’s not has been,had been,will be,not was,not is..(all again laughs)..but IT IS(all brusts into laughter)..it IS a fact that Gary and Lillie are the same thing appearing to each other as a bit different,bit distant,bit amusing,bit charming..(all again laugh)..but they are always EVER the same reality only appearing as different here thus they are in essence ever the same constant ONE(all smile)and no forsaken Vulture or  damn Cerulian Mob..(all brusts into laughter).. can EVER do anything about it(all laugh)...” Gary(laugh) : “that’s how the night passed then...(all brusts into laughter)..” Mehadi(smile,blush) : “um..well at this rate I could even tell the..um..” Daisy(smirk) : “proposal”(Mehadi blushs,hugs Daisy) Lillie( ary) : “go on, it’s never been any better” Gary(laugh,  Lillie) : “man..really Mehadi,you’ve bitten him long enough”(all brusts into laughter,Mehadi blushes) Lillie(smile) : “anyhow Mehu,go on with the proposal line..” All in unison : “yeah go on”
Mehadi(smile) : “alright,here,so,that one reality that in due to this mind and body seeming just like a mirage as Gary and Lillie to themselves as appearing in this world and though they realize that actually Gary is also Lillie and Lillie is also Gary yet as they have this difference appearing before themselves through this world their relationship is thus best interpreted in a way which is that,that which here is appearing as Gary and that which here is appearing as Lillie may please answer the question whether they do want to be (smile) Married..”
Gary&Lillie(ach other and holding hands,Unison) : “WE DO” (Mehadi and Daisy claps and then all smiles and laughs) Gary(laugh) : “and Tracy’s having his proposal rehearsed now..(all again brusts into laughter).. meticulously (all again laughs out loud)” (just then Seth and Tracy enters,all brusts into even more laughter) Daisy(laughing) : “three cheers for Seth Ketchum,Coupling Master”(all brusts into laughter and cheers) Seth(smile) : “um..thanks..that’s funny..hey Gary,hey all..um.. sorry about last..” Tracy(laugh) : “sweet sweet Seth-boy..(all laughes even more)” Seth(laugh) : “um..well universal sweetboy to friendboy to playboy to villianboy to masterboy to demonboy to philosophyboy to finally comedyboy now...(all laughs uncontrollably)..Gary,who’s that Pokemon?”(all brusts into laughter) Lillie( ary) : “Seth,you’ve just given us that spark back again” Seth(smile) : “um..thanks Lillie..”
Daisy(mocking Seth’s anger) : “what did you say Lil?again?again?..”(all brusts into laughter) Seth(blush) : “um..well it’s a good thing that..”
Tracy(laughing) : “Vultures aren’t insinuating anything..”(all laugh uncontrollably) Seth(smile) : “well vultures did insinuate this one out(all laughs)” Daisy : “surely Seth,I was never more angrier on anyone more when we first called in the night and never happier about the same person in a matter of minutes(all smile).I still can’t imagine how someone insults just about anyone to death and torments his beloved girlfriend to hell only to vividly direct her to jubilantly accept his proposal and then goes to fetch the ring overnight in a city in which he’s the most cherished villian and gets mobbed while somehow managing to get the ring by forcing the mob down to utter confusion and on the way back to his fiancee rather takes a detour to nonchalantly come back to patch up with those whom he insulted to the absolute extreme just hours ago during their bedtime with such ultimate faith that nothing ever happened that he pulls a nasty prank on them in the end and then jovially goes back to make his proposal official,which takes place moments before in the deep night under the glare of the most incensed people that are his family or like family who wants to crush him into pieces out of resentment over his prolonged cruelty and rudeness,pulls off a lecture with the words giving a completely different impression to what he’s trying to say,which is actually the most personal matter of his relationship with his fiancee,all this taking place via a conference call where his fiancee is present with him as well,calms his beraters down to such a degree that they can’t help but to become most warm,frank and beloved to him as they’ll remember the night forever as every time it’ll give them an ultimate strength and joy- Ketchum,this alone should get you to the very top of Hall of Fame” (all smile)
Seth(blush) : “um..thanks Daisy..it was..um..”
Tracy(laughing) : “but hours later by this very same man who laughed his whole night off, I had the fortune to be graced with the most inteicate epilogue(all laugh)so that no sinister words like BEST,PERFECT,FOREVER OR DESTINY(all brusts into laughter) can ever get their dirty hands to his perfectly attuned logic on how to differntiate a compliment from an insinuation (all laughs loudly) as he scared me to death by triggering a false alarm among his pokemons that forced Mrs Ketchum and Mime out of the kitchen(all laugh)so that all could come here today for lunch(all brusts into laughter) as he precisely inferred that his mom hadn’t started preparing the lunch yet(all brusts into laughter) all the while his fiancee played along excuisitely well directed only through a momentary eye contact(all laugh,Mehadi blushs) and threatened to kill me by her Golduck(all laugh) that she was taking away from me(all brusts into laughter).Then this man beautifully proceeded along with our business(all laugh) all the while threatening me with his Gerninja all the time as he proudly roasted all unimaginable breed of different types of specieses of various Vultures (all brusts into laughter)
only to insinuate (all laugh) that he and all three of us the other guys should hold a ceremony right in the middle of the pool that’s called the damn central battlefield (all laugh) in the gym,which never served his favourite dish for the guests(all laughs) and pick up our respective flowers(all laugh) right in front of all those Vultures (all laugh) and their Lackey the eternal Cerulian pests(all brusts into laughter) that ever thought what they’re seeing is an illusion(all brusts into laughter)and then he concluded with the fact that if he’s made the manager there,any dumbnut having the utter buffooness(all brusts into laughter) to come as a challenger anytime except 11-11:15 (all brusts into laughter) in the morning without 7 league titles and 31 Kanto badges(all laughs more) will be given a most precisely prepared eloquent class on rigourous vultureology of insinuation”(all brusts into laughter and laughs for a long time)
Gary(laugh) : “Seth you’ve truly become a Master of illogical non-implications(all laugh)which isn’t imperfectly uninsinuable”(all brusts into laughter)
Lillie(tears after laughing) : “no Seth,i’ve hardly ever cried like I did yesterday and i’ve hardly ever cried like now i’m(all laugh)...and the way to say extremely personal things in this manner so that any unimaginable hellfire(all brusts into laughter) melts away in unimaginable fun and joy in no time...really Mehu,keep biting him every night”
(all brusts into laughter)

(Night,Zipgarnet Lake,After Brock Leaves)
Mehadi(looking at Seth, oy) : “Seth,today was even better than yesterday,how long have we been married?”
Seth(looking at Mehadi, ehadi,Smile) : “Always” (both keep ach other beside the lake,same spot where Mehadi and Seth met for the very first time) Mehadi(lying down,head on Seth’s Lap,looking at Seth,Smile) : “more than 17 years..this spot, finally here again today..and only last 30/31 itself was the testament as well as nutshell of our bond for the last 17 years..in this form,in this life as Mehadi and Seth..now wife and husband.. isn’t it the longing for this moment itself justify our separation and heart wrenching feeling for each other? Seth(looking at Mehadi,cajoling Mehadi’s head and cheeks and fondles her hairs) : “absolutely Mehu,absolutely..but you know there’s a possibility that your soulmate isn’t born with you if one believes in multiple lives...and it gets even more difficult if you have only one life and even more difficult if there are many soulmates in human form...so at the end it really doesn’t matter...” Mehadi(smile) : “yup!if you have a soul that’s your mate in itself..” Seth(smile) : “absolutely...but if you have one,you’ll anyhow find out...so basically all you can do is to be brutally honest with yourself and just wait-it-out in fun” Mehadi(smile) : “and you really have put the smiles back to others increasing it by manifolds” Seth(smile) : “well,i’m ever happy to come into any benevolent service,I only wish Violet could be here today” Mehadi(laugh) : “Lil said she would’ve ate you up(both laughs),she would’ve already eaten Brock up as well” Seth(laugh) : “yeah,we’re going tomorrow,when is she returning?” Mehadi(smile) : “day after,(laugh)she’ll be all over you with arts and Mantyke(both brusts into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “what was her interpretation of my sinister note to you?” Mehadi(laugh) : “she thought it couldn’t be a romantic one(both brusts into laughter)” Seth(laugh) : “and she was all the time in the room beside her sister when I was giving you the oath to hell(both laugh),so I must be straight out of hell as well(both laugh)” Mehadi(smile) : “Seth,just a thing, with all that you did,(laugh) why didn’t you ever think that we could just fix things in a series of dates?” Seth(smile) : “and be tormented even more when I can’t adore my little cherished flower despite having her all the time?”(both laugh) Mehadi(smile) : “Seth,I guess we’ll have to stay separated sometimes now that you’re getting back to hall of fame,so much they’ll force you to” Seth(laugh) : “i’ll mouth anything off to hell if I don’t like it(both laugh),i’m not leaving Cerulian as long as you don’t come with me(both smile)” Mehadi(smile) : “Seth,i’ve had all the name and fame just like you,but the experience I had with you just before we got married once more as we have forever, nothing matches that and you knew it when you had the same with that picture of mine,still as always wasn’t it,’hey Mehadi,come look at this pokemon?”(both laugh and smile) Seth(smile) : “ya,I guess,but once I fully grasped it I just knew you had to be mine and viseversa,once you and I was of the same age and in a situation where we could get married happily in all ways” Mehadi(smile) : “and if it didn’t happen we both had to leave this body ti unify!” Seth(smile) : “ ‘gotcha..”
Seth&Mehadi(Unison, ,smile) : “Soulmate!”

Dawn(laughing..) : "so yeah i had 44 brats who caught me at the very start(all laugh..lot)..and Cobbie came the 3rd month barring the starting one(all laugh)..and he came along with Celesteela in a group first ever 2 catches(all burst..) from same valley(all burst..) next group was Terrakion and Aerodactyl from same valley again anything else(all laugh..lot)..and this was capped off by GARCHOMP(all un..)..whole of next day i was unconscious yet understood how Chumpie was mingling in my concepts of personal life(all un..) so woke up next day then the day after that was with her next day kicked out to get a Kaledo time now Phantom(all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) in my 2nd month from start i was with 5 pseudo-legends and my starter without a single gym,cup or contest entry 2 months into my VERY first journey(all laugh..lot)..and i was the greatest sacrificial lamb to this impossible and inhuman scheme never mentioned to me(all laugh..lot)..so next month i knew i'll do the cup against my desire to become a co-ordinator anyway i was thinking just one off next League absolutely Phantom(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) then i get into the cup and all break this news i was so angry and frustrated and afraid and felt cheated and all i dialled the Police straightaway on charge of abduction in front of a BoD cup all looked at me definitely as Phantom(all un..)..anyway first ever cup with 6 pseudo-legends and yeah a ground cup had to be with the Leading Rock organising my beheading(all laugh..lot)..so no wonder i failed so so miserably after Unovan bushes began(all laugh..lot)..man i still thank DESTINY so much that it saved my poor Zekrom from horrendous fellow menaces like Zeky Ketchum(all laugh..lot,Glayds,Genkai and Blossom,Seth and Kazuhiro and this is your CUMULATIVE contribution to their lives,all un..,Cilan too un..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so after i enter my first contest with Cobalion,Terrakion,Aerodactyl,Celesteela,Garchomp and Empol ofcourse with Kaledo,Silvally and lastly Urshifu having just come 5 days before(all laugh..lot)..settled on 3nd last day next day i had time with her but the day after i was forced to  anesthesia and woke up at the facilitation for my first contest with the Leading Crook saying in front of everyone..
wake up..wake up..oh my baby wake up)/emotion, excitement..oh let my baby intellect in self wake up(all un..,..Dashing Leading Rock,all un..),while moving a sandwich in front of my face(all un..)..this was the simulation of physical paralysis with ensuing physical danger from a public execution being tormented with food after starvation hence that song on self intellect(all un..,Genkai and Blossom,Kazuhiro,Seth..Dialga don't be a gambler just let you get this feeling soaked,all un..,as you understand you're soaking can you feel your self without being now going broke,all un..,Lixue,Rakim,Ash,Nirja&Stash..Oh The Dagger of life now face this Boulder look has come the Dashing Cloak,all un..,May..good morning Brock,have you felt that mental morning is not only in your being that the biological clock now having enough to let also your emotions to get soaked,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot),this was the very start then i woke up and was so angry and frustrated and all exactly when i realized this whole situation hence calmed down a bit preparing my logic of namecalling(all laugh..lot)..yeah that is spontaneous hence must be logical else next flight goodbye with a just caught Elusive??(all un..,David and Sirichai..Dark Nights with Brat Ketchums,all un..),anyway(all laugh..lot),then i get in having known that i was this great sacrifice for the embodiment of The Elusive??(all laugh..)..no a few did complain exactly this hence some counsellors came after my win saying congrats Dawn but life is so enjoyable you know not always so destiny driven(all un..),i just told them to put a translator in none found them again at their personality or profession it's heard cause of the art of starvation(all un..) anyway then first of all there's this huge official furore on abuse and abduction cause none knew my whereabouts for 2 months barring Professor Kukui who ofcourse refused to divulge it(all laugh..lot)..and yeah this reminds me what happened at Birch labs when Max joined Oak Labs and i recall this cause this utter pest was the only one whom i could relate to the most there and still he's 6 long years older to me(all laugh..lot).."
Max(laughing..) : "well the Sinnoh entourage was certainly something unveiling Project Baby Dawn(all laugh..lot)..and we were kept in dark then Seth returns too happy says finally we found the embodiment of the whole WaterFire clan(all laugh..lot)..then ofcourse two of the versions were present with us(all laugh..lot),they certified the same but then wanted to fondle her too much that's Lillie flower ofcourse(all laugh..lot) which they were denied the rights of after mingling DaisyDevil into it when Dawnny was tricked to say how she was so proud to meet her hearing her fortitude against the personal life difficulties since her TRAVEL days(all burst..),this completely set her off on Lastly Phantom who as usual only thickened it(all laugh..lot)..and Dawnny was made to listen to this to test if she could mingle Viol flower's emotional intelligence into the Characteristics of DaisyDevil(all laugh..lot)..which she did by advocating for what she wanted to do herself which she expected from us and all while disparaging our characters viciously but then was again tricked into insinuating about Dr Oak and Discuss-Gap hence the original WaterFires viciously jumped her(all laugh..lot),no it was a literal melee and the sort of language they were using and all thoroughly scanned Dawnny's particular existence and initiated the Project Baby Dawn(all laugh..lot)..which again the 2 versions of flowers there when asked of any objections vehemently criticised the Master Brats for denying full enshrinement of personal minuteness in the name of characters(all un..)..later during Unova and subsequent when Dawnny wasn't LIKING us(all laugh..lot) then ofcourse Master Brats will always go after you no matter where you are as you know Poppy says that even Mrs Chansbert said this is unethical practice out of institutionalization this is inhuman(all burst..) but anyhow these all actually proved that how Project Baby Dawn was actually always there it's just that existence always colludes with Master Brats against comprehension(all laugh..lot)..no man the things Dawnny had to go through was absolutely 2 whole careers fused in one in one journey the very first the only reason was that she couldn't do Unova right after her physique would've given up hence was debarred and then the rest is just what it is explicable never comprehensive just as that 5 year long darkened drama just to be countering(all laugh..lot)..anyway when i joined the Oak Labs,all everywhere disparaged all that's my,countering hallow never hi hence themselves fell silent when they had to choose between welcome or bye.. analysis look causality now Phantom(all un..)..so i just sent a report how many from even Pasio our most staunch opponents holistic is producing these great results and all and neither Dr Oak nor Lillie flower the owners anyway don't need any money to start with i said how can you claim anything as your own if your name is like Lillie flower(all laugh..lot).. it's impossible to live in things hence it's just the pieces of existential puzzle for each them and others too nothing else(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(laughing..) : "well about these nuances of the project Mango told me Dr jackal and DaisyDevil suddenly put our elusive passing bar of dual ethics to rank impossibility now being too happy finding similar sort of beings(all laugh..lot)..said we only knew how you were this millenial being here to relief potential from procedure no wonder you went to the bushes without a Venonat(all un..)..anyway then my first cup there was this huge furore none in the world supported this scheme this time even Gemmie,Oskie and Penny abstained from voting forcing their beaus to the same and jointly cited the reason being personal inabilities in professionalized rather than applicable psychology of perception(all un..)..so(all laugh..lot) all past and current vetoed to stop it including Sakura and all barring Snorie,Slirrie,Redzie,Centie and Putu ofcourse they are never allowed to vote anyway cause it biases the outcome(all laugh..lot).. thankfully Mummy and Sruzie then Percy and Manthie and even Gabriel and Mateo they are a bit more sane(all laugh..lot) so all were against Master Brats except Marc the Mr Litman no reasons needed(all un..,Iris..no Iris don't tell them that they did a commendable job tell them they did a equitable job as else it'll only make them egotistical not enthused to the cause of their expectations on self satiation..once my Breedril not doing thus failed to win a round hence i thought this,all un..,..Marc the Mr Litman,all un..)..so(all laugh..lot),he said his Oricorio once in a round asked him if he should listen to him or remember his teaching(all un..long time),to which i answered(all un..),the belief compeer else you get my intention not what my analysis tells me and thus how i intend to use it to get my intention thus you unless see my beliefs can only get what i desire not behind them what are my feelings(all un..long time) hence this being should be allowed to undertake these ideas else can't know if they were mere beliefs of being or belief itself in it's own being becoming the self-that feeling(all un..long time)..so this supported the crook as well who actually is the founder of these sort of training methods that his direct disciples got by the feelinng apprantly by their own actually just a mockery of what as another can be known(all laugh..lot)..anyway,then all there at the cup says your first brat will be Garchomp if you can't win one round with her you're going to jail for using substances(all laugh..lot),i was groomed to say no this is unfair but now remembered my teaching of saying to add-
jail : the defection of analogy from useful activity to  insightful productivity,countering necessary : the usefulness of necessity(all un..long time),so now i had to look at their belief in itself that's this meaning to add with else you'll be jailed-the most entailing(all un..long time),so i said if i win one I'll change him no matter she being my last brat cause every round is deemed discrete in self which you've not specified(all un..,..Baby Dawn Groudon,Dawn un..).."
May(laughing..) : "well Max said um..hey May if you were asked to validate yourself and you didn't agree to them did you start with saying this idea that has invaded your mentality and ended with hence you see mentality is a general term only that's unbiased thanks(all un..,..Baby Dawn Groudon,Dawn un..)..i said may be when it was mom or dad(all burst..),um..no Yohana aunty was very scared with all this on being questioned Dawnny started with how she felt her behaviour is analyzed not due to what she was questioned but how she answered it(all un..long time,..Baby Dawn Groudon,all un..,Dawn too un..) and ended with hence i demand acknowledgement of my desire behind my motivations not whether or how i achieve it(all un..) then ended with my my my what a pleasure for thy only to derive in place of intelligble hallow a reactive hi i DEMAND freedom of what i'm taught how i apply ok(all un..long time,..Baby Dawn Groudon,all un..,Dawn un..)"
Seth(laughing..) : "yeah Dawnny always used this phrase i just convoluted it with experience(all burst..,Dawn un..)..man as much calm and methodical Combu and her rose were baby Dawnny exceeded everything(all laugh..lot)..we met her first and was thinking how has this sample been able to camouflage the existential self so well found out it was just behavioural impatience Mehu is only logically so nowhere near baby Dawn in terms of explosiveness(all laugh..lot).."
Max(laughing..) : "first time i said hallow Dawn,hallow MR Maximilian(all burst..,Dawn un..),so i knew this sort of a pest is going a long long way down darkness(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(laughing..) : "well this is how i was always irritated there cause none listened to how they came to my intellect(all burst..)..first of all i never had any associations with master brats or Doctor Slate and so on cause neither mom nor dad liked them(all laugh..lot)..still now sometimes bro irritates them saying saw how her brat stopped her brats JUST to have an animation at home(all burst..)..so this is how everyone pester me always(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i go to Professor Kukui for a starter and got Empol the the rockets intruded once more as ever thankfully for them the last time in their careers(all laugh..lot)..they i heard said we were told not to mingle with those brats after Hoenn cause they always suspected that Mehu flower will vehemently object to end her her travelling days before atleast 23 years(all laugh..lot)..so once that wasn't the case they tried it but Sinnoh was their stubbornness just anyway they came and all then Master Brat with Dashing Crook came first they did what they do then i ofcourse knew them all do master brats don't have any address actually it's impossible for them like how can it be comprehensive that one can find master brats to start with(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i didn't know about their works and all at all infact i just knew they were this strange thought provoking creatures(all laugh..lot)..anyway so i first of all saw the Dashing Crook(all laugh..lot) and instantly realized why even here all are around him like bunch of indolent fans(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i was going away from the convention that always takes place with Dashing Rock on this occasion(all laugh..lot) so i was going away on the gate they looked at me like was i out of this world(all laugh..lot),anyway i became the target of the rockets as i stepped out and so on existence played a game of chance with me you know(all laugh..lot)..anyway then crook asks of my health and all normal stuff takes half a minute(all laugh..lot) and they never ask for any specifications in such scenarios ever(all laugh..lot),so i have no idea why this idea came to my mind again a self to self tickling game i later found out(all laugh..lot) i said um..Mr Slate would you travel with me Professor can't travel with me and i wanted to travel alone but i don't understand these maps and all(all laugh..lot),well you can hook up with anyone,um..yeah but um..i just feel that it's exactly not nice cause i would start of as just a customer rather than a friend or something hence also i offered you to join me first than asking to accept me in your group(all un..,The Ethics of Moral Honesty,all un..),and the reply to those so exhorted views is(laughing)..Daftorabofajlitujerif(all un..long time)!..first of all Iris what does it mean(all un..)"
Iris(laughing..) : "no Ferdi don't move your head or eyebrows or anything barring widening your mouth when you shake hands else it's impossible to know whether you're acknowledging the actor's action or your own reaction..once my Omanyte couldn't draw a round due to this i remember(all un..long time,..Marc The Mr Litman,all un..)"

Leading Rock,all laugh..lot)..yeah if only i knew(all laugh..lot)..then next was fly last was normal so i thought ok i can't go beyond atleast ground/normal mix(all laugh..lot)..water/ice was second best steel third and grass types i knew pretty well hence thought ok i can manage darks and fairys psychics i can't i know it too but ghosts i heard is just playful so i thought ok they won't be mine so why would they want me to be them(all laugh..lot)..then i didn't know any valley except where grass pokemons were found and for water/ice i just wanted to visit the southern commons for long with like 10 grass types(all laugh..lot)..steel I thought well if i can get good but i'm not going to search many places and which will those places be at all i'll learn where to find them on the go(all laugh..lot)..then i didn't know about authority,champions,general training,special training even(all laugh..lot),research,medicine_test nothing i didn't even know how to be a gym leader no i didn't know i had no interest in these things(all laugh..lot) i only learnt the contest rules and the breeders and doctors(all laugh..lot)..no i really didn't know i tell you(all laugh..lot,..Baby Dawn Groudon,all laugh..lot)..and the month after this day i had a Cobalion which Mango later explained was caught by purely abstract sensitivization of () planes(all laugh..lot),anyway(all laugh..lot) so then i thought with the brats who grasped me doesn't care a fig for any specifications surely so i just decided to do what i knew 24/7 since someone snatched away my lollypop as a kid at second sem school then when i grabbed her,her twin bro came over and alone overpowered me by pulling my hair(all burst..) to this his sis laughed so much saying see boys have more power than us..nana(all un..),so(all laugh..lot) i was so happy dad wasn't there among us for guidelines(all burst..,Bazugh,David,Sirichai,Iris,Marlon and Bonnie,May,Melody un..) anyway that was the only thing i knew the biasing and unbiasing and it's neutrality i knew everything about it later read so much about rights and all the only things that the master brats didn't consider at all cause they're only derivatives of ADMINISTRATION and POLICING..the most Encouraging(all un..),anyhow(all laugh..lot)..so of course those had been deepened far more just to be countering obviously(all laugh..lot)..that's all i knew and read the social this and that hence only failed the sociology papers cause i knew too much for society(all burst..)..and that was such a wrong choice you know i found out Hands-On(all laugh..lot,..Civilization,all laugh..lot)..anyway so i returned to now what the master brats did with general public at certain issues then saw that there's no end to it cause that is all about them(all laugh..lot)..now it already was 3 in the night(all laugh..lot)..so i slept for 3 hours woke up at 6 meaning it's now about 13 at Marengo so tried to contact Sabrina first up with the intention to talk about pure grass type training(all laugh..lot)..so i call her,um..hallow Ms Marnold i'm Dawn Berlitz..,ah Dawnny you bros told me about you today morning here(all laugh..lot),um..thanks Ms Marnold um..,no it's ok dear i also don't have much time today itself there had to be so much pressure they told me they think you're best suited for medicine test actually(all laugh..lot) to check that infact you can read this article i once had to give this talk from dark type point of views and they recorded it here this is the name best wishes dear i'll be free later call me then(all laugh..lot),so i thought this is a trap to defame me(all laugh..lot)..anyway the day before i didn't look up Sabrina now i do and again there's so much work about Haunter(all laugh..lot)..but i just got how these brats spoil so many truly great people(all laugh..lot) anyway then i went to that talk didn't understand even the words why they were in a sentence I didn't know anything(all laugh..lot)..anyway so then it's breakfast time and i went in now instantly recalled about its emphasis so was attentive to it then i just tried to do that staying attentive after food but couldn't so i thought ok i'll do some kind of mentation which i did all the time till it was evening Sabrina wasn't available whole world was channelized into Marengo ofcourse i too undertood how(all laugh..lot)..so i didn't like it how they were deceiving me hence i just went back doing those mentations thinking about that song rather the meaning ofcourse(all laugh..lot) and yeah Empol was snatched away from me the day before(all laugh..lot) so i did those mentations and all till it was evening when i go to meet them and i see Simile Popcorn doing the rhythm i instantly thought of that very song with both her feets and finger on ger nose with breathing exercises and the feet movements was of a strange pattern later learnt how regular jumping rope can become so horrendous a methodology of THE MEANING(all laugh..lot)..so i said,um..hallow Ms Ketchum i'm Dawn Berlitz i was told to come here at this time to meet Mr Stash and Doctor Brock so i guess you're here for that(all laugh..lot),no i'm not sorry(all laugh..lot),um..ok but um..can you tell me..,no no i don't know about them they left before i came and Stashey never keeps a number Brock is unreachable i too tried sorry to disappoint you Ms Berlitz(all laugh..lot),um..but um..do you know anything about me(all laugh..lot),no more than what you said just previously no more(all laugh..lot),um..ok sorry to disturb you Ms Ketchum,take car..,Himjabifemultepik(all un..),i really thought i wasn't but was this creatur.. what is wrong with me(all un..,Serena..Reticence Vat,all un..long time),so i really didn't understand anything but none of the other people did either(all laugh..lot),then she says in front of all this is Ms Dawn Berlitz,Pokemon Master,Gallery of Fame,12,12,12,12,no situational discritization,the most emotionally continuing
thanks(all un..)..zapped me off with her to where how could i have known as i didn't even understand how zapping worked(all laugh..lot)..now i was zapped to this room where instantly someone blindfolded and gagged me next thing i knew i was in this dark cave with a fire at the outlet with an extremely strange looking creature sitting beside it poking the fire with an iron stick singing(all laugh..lot)..

Dawn(laughing..) : "so(all laugh..lot) such a brat is agnostic of skills(all burst..)..and no a few others may know but none in the known ranks know it and i'm sure they can't apply it if say a Ghostradarkarrigussonor calm max full wild(all burst..) turns upon Professor or grandma or Cippie(all laugh..lot)..that only these 5 menaces can do but again master brats never needed it or the fact that it's tacit you know they are completely knowledge proof(all un..)..man what sort of creatures these are(all laugh..lot) and yeah obviously you don't need to know or do anything if you know what's Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..but the only difference to all including Kuzu and rest is that they learnt everything only after Marengo and then they spent all their lives till then surrounded by pokemons and i only knew about non psychic grass types(all laugh..lot) and was forced into one of the most elusive facets of their skillset before i could register(all burst..)..with 2 most evolved record setter Reshirams trained by a being never person named Simile Popcorn yeah those were that brat's(all laugh..lot) with a most raw prototype translator that was first to be rejected later(all laugh..lot),anyway(all laugh..lot)..no wonder i couldn't find any word called solace(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Daily Hologram sticks with me for my safety as i was communicating with Rim and Seam(all laugh..lot)..i when  woke up saw how Raki treats his brats as if all of them including him are 3 year olds(all laugh..lot)..but anyway when i woke up i first saw Raki and i was gagged and deafened i couldn't talk or hear anything(all laugh..lot),then just saw what he was doing with his brats for sometimes then he left and Lixue came in untangled me and gave me some food that was so delicious which i learnt later one from the collection of Pewter Dish(all laugh..lot)..anyway then Lixue first forcefully fed me holding me up herself they never required any assistance in that as never knew what it means in application only what it means in rendition(all un..,..Simile Popcorn,all un..), anyway so i tasted it was great food and she fed me throughout then washed my hands i only had to wash my mouth(all burst..) and only then i was allowed to talk and this is my first record as my communicator was returned to me(all laugh..lot)..so i put it out as record she didn't have any recorders.."

after much fuss win and all so yeah out of all this very start was THE most memorable(all laugh..lot)..some people asked me which journey was better first or last..first ofcourse is first ever in Frontier system(all laugh..lot) but they said no in the last you were so assured(all laugh..lot) i said well i by then had enough not to be so and had to foster my sonny as well(all laugh..lot) but i old Gustie too day 1 that it wasn't first journey it was a textbook to all who wants to get prepared to see The Elusive??(all laugh..lot)..and then what to do there is actually all the same like Kanto same setup same everything but the Gyaradoses had the incentives Irissalad didn't have any damn thing to do with them except the same number of journeys and the assurance of the Elite4 shot hence volunteered to jump into Unova with thankfully a Haxorus atleast(all burst..)..oh yeah i also was told that they always patronized why neither Poppy nor Mehadi were chosen in you place hum(all un..),i said you need assistance way more than I'll ever require cause you believe you cam answer someone asking you to confirm his or her gender while giving the rigour behind you reasoning(all un..,..The Darkened Ones,all un..,Seth un..)..or can answer if it were you the questioner was talking to not your sense faculties reflecting the fact that you were sure you were talking with someone particular rather than logical(all un..,..The Clinical Ones,all un..,Kazuhiro un..)..and Dave knows very well what was going on at Veilstone so perfect name as well for exactly that(all laugh..lot)..man i heard the Great Boss said that that journey was the SOLE reason why we involved the lower foot tactics cause if the best of profession can't hack a teenager what would you do when Kimmie the Kommo-O comes to have metaphysical tea with you(all burst..)..and in the end i wasn't abducted to Unova to sort myself out only as you know they themselves did that but from Unova the younger and most hideously from under the cover the elder hence that mess was created..and yeah my routine was like that today i'll be at the southern commons tommow at Surelectric Valley whereas yesterday i was at Linoluni Ranges(all laugh..lot)..then the same month 2 cups 2 gyms next month 2 gyms and 2 contests again after having a bash at Lyfostrafos ofcourse the day before a contest or so(all laugh..lot)..and yeah each were class of eminences or run by book of distinctions(all laugh..lot)..then at Johto some said man it doesn't get any better than that can it like it's so EXCITING(all burst..) then said why would you think about personal life man what's in it so ENTICING(all un..)..i said if only what you said comes in psychic and emotional channels from plane agnostic menaces that isn't going to be found before atleast a millenia you'll know indeed it was so ensuing(all laugh..lot)..and i always say these cause it was like i started at 17 and 7 after completing one of my sociology papers the month before mind the subject(all burst..) and it was cause i failed in the written but passed the demonstrative meaning i didn't cheat atleast unlike a few(all laugh..lot,May.. Civility Hands-On,all burst..,Gladys,Genkai and Blossom,Kazuhiro,Seth.....),so(all laugh..lot) then at 17 and 7 i started and ended at 20 and 3 with the ultimate possiblities of my present profession having been all done and dusted there's nothing left to do good night have a nice life and i was 20 and 5 rhymes saw(all burst..)..but yeah May it would've been a piece of cake for someone like your beau why would he reject this opportunity just for sake of education(all burst..)"
May(laughing..lot) : "why cause i come from a CULTURED family ok(un..,all un..)..man my ?? was tormented like nothing but still said thank God each time i had enough civility to make sure they leave me alone to travel around DESTINY(un..,all un..)..and no Pasio was a special journey for both of us but it was nothing like Sinnoh man that was massacre of general training profession(all laugh..lot)..i could do everything barring the press at Hoenn but Dawnny was like couldn't even eat by own hands or brush her teeth and all(all laugh..lot)..all knew Unova was coming and it did come but then Crawdauntogator was another level that none realized how was possible like that Kalos Final with the subsequent bro vs beau hallucinations that's not happening again no way not in temporal scales only existential definitely(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(laughing..) : "well once i went to a psychiatrist she said Ms Berlitz cheer up life is always about in self feeling not being a possibility fuelled decision(all burst..),i said yeah thanks that feeling(all un..)..man it's just impossible to reject the that dark clan once you've been part of it(all laugh..lot)..then once at a pub some asked hey Dunnie how's the drinks after party heard they are the MOST expensive(all un..),so i was embroiled in a melee as an answer(all laugh..lot) which was true but psychic channel and personal life are never going to conjoin always transposed(all laugh..lot)..and well still first final was Mr Georges next the very next day one and only Melody(all laugh..lot)..and these brats were so happy at Sinnoh cause they could babysit her and irritate me all they wanted all the time while dictating poor Johnny Lad's psychological states then via proxy only(Melody bursts..,all laugh..lot)"
Melody(laughing..) : "well that journey was something else for me after around 6 years of upheavals(all laugh..lot) and yeah these brats were too happy most of the times i travelled with the The Feathered Ones(all laugh..lot) alongside Simile Popcorn and Daily Hologram as our preceptors who as a pair was a horrendous torture on duality(all laugh..lot),anyway(all laugh..lot),then next group started with Lillie flower(all laugh..lot) and ended with Poppy flower(all laugh..lot) and ofcourse the tuple of Lastly Phantom and Shadowy Lantern the most engulfing team for duality atleast their elder ones weren't physically violent(all laugh..lot) they always brought two hand combat pads and gloves along when they argued were doing the physical exercise as well which Niji always hit and Ash ducked(all burst..) their elder ones were happy with only the completely wrong only not to them the full match shadows(all un..) and all of these menaces were the entourage of as i said Incentive Overdose(all laugh..lot) who always brought her own personal security thus that was Stashey boy(all burst..)..and yeah sometimes Yumi was flown in whereas Vigil was kicked away to Sinnoh after the very second journey at Unova and didn't meet Yumi till she ended her journey he always complained to us how inhuman this setting was that he had to peek from Hoenn this time(all laugh..lot) then when Lillie flower was there she went to meet always Gladly Syndrome hence both were always at risk as they ventured forth in wilderness(all laugh..lot) Hui could manage only one so always any of the master brats managed the other and only her family was controlling Gladie's effusiveness the only ones who could(all laugh..lot)..with Jubilee Hands-On you don't become anything only Hands-On(all burst..) anyway then after this finally bro was left to manage Incentive Overdose's moods via communicators(all laugh..lot) while always poking both her and her beau's relationships always that was shown separate hence both were mad and returned the difference of the join(all un..) anyhow(all laugh..lot) so then the final set was baby Dawn who was at the care of Dashing Crook(all laugh..lot) and was finally left to consult with anytime anyplace-Premise Ordain..anything else(all burst..),apart from how to understand life not just understand life(all un..) as it was taught by the likes of Loaf and Toast(all burst..) man it's so true what Dawnny just said it was a textbook to the practice of meeting The Elusive Dragon certainly she got hands-on dragonic teachers literally along with Ms Volbeat's translation courses on emotional existence and obscurity(all laugh..lot)..but yeah the Kanto Beginning with the disciples with their flowers hosted by the twin paring of the opposing versions of the master brats along with Who-oh-Ringtone(all un..long) who was managing Gladly Syndrome and The Feathered Ones doing the rounds in-between never together(all laugh..lot) with finally the Leading Rock being the head of this whole band that entourage of sanity(all burst..) certainly was out of this world absolutely(all laugh..lot)..still it's like daily novels so May traveled with a strange set of brats actually(all laugh..lot)"
May(laughing..) : "well unlike each atleast i was well educated before going out if not made cultured over that as a bonus not candour thankfully Drew says(all un..)..and ofcourse when you're with Dr jackal or Mr Cubin or Dashing Crook you don't think about civility even Melody literally hit Brock so many times who was 41 and Melody was 32(all burst..,Melody un..,..Dashing Dashing Rock)..but well i travelled with Cladly and Scarlie throughout that was something(all laugh..lot)..no i literally traveled with all that was at Hoenn then with as usual Doctor Slate as personal sweeper (all laugh..lot)..of those FEELINGS (all un..,..THAT FEELING..shh..so NAÏVE,all un..)..man no wonder only someone as outrageous as Ms Volbeat could better the Dashing Rock(all laugh..lot)..but just a thing Gladie how was the travel of DaisyDevil(all laugh..lot)"
Gladys(laughing..) : "look observing your self is a management bully with recurrent characterizations in hand(all un..)/look now is forwarding the dissent of having induction rather than perception in your character's hand(all un..,..DaisyDevil)..well still it wasn't like our Ransei holidays atleast(all laugh..lot)"
Hua(laughing..) : "excuse us but we're searching for Mr Vitor Vuhagob,we see welcome welcome it's gonna be pretty long(all laugh..lot),Sir 'mam it's ok we could..(all laugh..lot),why not sonny whole world know your..,but it could also be called contravention(all un..),who the namecall is this and why has he appeared of the blue(all burst..)..no no i was always here just before you mentioned me i just was a bit..um..as me contagious(all un..),oh yeah..,STOP! IT'S THAT JACKAL OF Detached Observation(all un..) read his words properly of being notionally contagious..
look in my eyes..what would i see(all un..)/the bush of observable eligibility(all un..)/from there i see your anger,and i see your dream(all un..)/just cause i'm the you in what you as i seem(all un..)/thus oh compeers..don't ask for my visibility(all un..)/as look i'm the jackal of believability(all un..)/as i'm the ?? of rationality(all un..)/oh mental Police the jackal of authority(all un..)/Oh Cerulean..look has finally in rhymes come..from the bushes of ego-The ?? of personality(all un..,..Dr jackal,all un..)..man when jackal arrived after 16 years and a quarter it was just impossible to describe what happened to each concerned planes(all laugh..lot)..and that fight glimpse was something else as well Seth would tell you his Gyarados only understands what he does if with him the counter to non self black box exactly why that drama played so perfectly for the casual onlookers(all laugh..lot,..The Darkened Ones,all burst..,Seth un..)"
Seth(laughing..) : "well unlike the Feathered Ones atleast we weren't mingling in prepositions never conjunctions(all un..)..anyway after the Rocketeers relieved us we were in a difficult physical situation so somehow made the shore then all of us fainted and well i only made it because Mehu was there no matter how weak cause any of the WaterFire's become invigorated in only those two elements the more raw the better always Kuzu only got that at Dark Nights(all un..)..anyway then she herself fainted and i anyway fainted before so Arct and Pullie were there to watch over who only poked both of us in unconscious too we realized just was in nervous agony(all laugh..lot)..anyway then i wake up first as Mehu fainted only trying to get me to wake up so fainted right upon me which meant i was in more danger cause she anyway weighs 75 kgs(all laugh..lot)..but later she told me if it were The Feathered Ones Slalom Seldom would heal herself by the process of nonchalant haste itself something Mehu when told said but that i can only practice out of emotion(all burst..) was told a piece that came as 'Practice : the motion of virtuality'(all un..,..The Feathered Ones,all un..)..anyhow(all laugh..lot),then i wake up to actually my brats forcing me to wake up as that was told to them if they sensed anything and felt i was out for too long for Mehu's comfort never mine you know that's not in consciousness(all burst..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so anyway i wake up somehow to a person who unlike Mehu or Brock or Ash or anyone was interested more to see if i was detached from being physically unconscious now for some logic(all un..) so then i saw a very handsome man in his late 20s it seemed had a forehead sweat band on forehead with half shorts and a green shirt and shoes all green with two greener sweat bands(all laugh..lot) and his look was exactly like he sees you and sketches you in himself as again the i in both observes(all burst..)..so then i said yeah thanks Sir,first words were,um..yeah,but your compeer is still unconscious we should get her back,i said how Dr Oak taught us to think in this physically dangerous situations as hmm..Pokemon Master..hmm..(all burst..)..observing THEN learning..hmm..(all un..),anyway(all laugh..lot),so i said yeah it's ok then he did the major work in helping Mehu up who also said thanks Sir thanks for saving us,no problem 'mam,Sir it's ok it's natural for anyone get yourselves comfortable,so we both now said,hmm..(all burst..),anyway then on the road to nearest centre says how he found us and all well none asked ever who we were since we were 4(all laugh..lot) anyway then ofcourse in reply to why my brats did do what he old them says oh i'm a researcher and pretty travel experienced too this is my 4th journey very last one was Unova itself(all laugh..lot) so i have the experiences first hand and all but suddenly a bell rings in my head as to how he looked at me then didn't return my thanks rather brushed it aside then when it was said for unison returned it saying 'mam BEFORE Sir so i said hang on what does he know of appropriation of spontaneity(all un..),so then after we reach the centre in like 2 minutes zapping(all laugh..lot) these were again just the consolidation phase so got 10/15 minutes so then i said well i have a few questions Nr Skechit that is cause you know from where i belong(all laugh..lot) so i just wanted to ask why you only replied to both our greeting in unison,then i see as if so much surprised says,no no you two were there together hence it was only ethical to reply to us than we you know these very well but you only said me cause it was spontaneous but then i thought ok in dulality it's discombobulating always the existence to look at hence had to wait till you recall the dual WE but then again it's spontaneity that physical verbosity or movement suddenly out of directional categorization from it's abstract form it might be hard for you to say WE before my get attached to my claim of being myself rather than the observer from it so then to help you also i pointed your attention to the WE in honesty without replying the thanks to be moral about my perception anyway thanks Mr Ketchum this opportunity to self rather than it's action(all un..,..Dr jackal,all un..),so i hardly managed to control myself from not send him as a ping pong between Arct and Pullie(all burst..) so i laughed and said yeah thanks but Mehu was smiling still understanding things so just before she's sent for checking i said thanks I won't need it Mehu too understanding something stopped expressing her dissent at me turning it to our facilitator(all laugh..lot),i said it's ok you go it's ethics(all burst..),so she goes and she had to wasn't ok for me and Kuzu that's not a problem cause we had to practice physical spontaneity whole day with master brats from 1.5 to 3.5 Hands-On too(all laugh..lot) which none else did physically certainly not if in conjunction cause The Feathered Ones first hand said not going to happen(all laugh..lot) and neither Margin himself testified  nor Dr Oak or Gladie or anyone else did that we were sure hence she goes i stay(all laugh..lot) now before she actually goes Dr jackal observes the whole situation similarly and gets up saying you should go too Mr Ketchum i'll wait for you and your friend to come out of the your troubles we'll meet then(all laugh..lot),then after that he himself actually comes in and we were sitting together so now normally talks also about it(all laugh..lot) so i was so irritated with my deduction powers(all burst..)..then anyway the language of ours were prepared Professionally for me and Personally for her(all burst..)..so he laughs and all then goes away but then we were talking about the brats and all anyway he told us will see Goldy,Tiffin,Arct and Pullie the only ones we had with us so then next day he says yeah thanks for letting me examine them it's nice to meet you etc verbal garbage(all laugh..lot),so now i said well i want to ask the things you studied at your research course Mr Skechit we've done not always a justice to it(all laugh..lot),again so naturally says no no it's only going to be an injustice if it were made stagnant at being not self Mr Ketchum cause formulation is impossible from actuative implementation rather than potential applications thus possible here is only axioms(all un..),so now Mehu asks him Mr Skechit my last caught mate is a Pyukumuku and her distinct feature is that she likes to play"


so i was in absolute heaven to be able to meet Dr jackal in psychophysical being(all laugh..lot) so now i contacted Lixue and asked her what you'd you see if you find the jackal as a researcher(all laugh..lot).."
Lixue(laughing) : "look that's a ?? of ensuing (all laugh..) thus is the Dr of self sufficiency that's   success's jackal(all un..)..with a pen just to be moral to the memorial dual hand(all un..)/look hops around the professional bushes(all un..)..to catch the self in personal sand(all un..)/oh it's a jackal of representation (all un..)..thus sketching what IS the you(all un..)/look enshrines the detached self in witnessing feeling(all un..)..by formulating your self not receiving in own but giving you that as that's what's not you(all un..)/oh look in this class of being..just entered the jackal of things(all un..)/is only here to observe how to see(all un..)..hence becomes a management bully observing the character of your self the me not your your that's the being(all un..,..The Fitted Ones,all un..)/oh hush before Reticence pay the emotional VAT(all un..)..you're observation is only to get your ego to on you tackle(all un..)/thus to be ego engulfing meaning look forward to the starving of the idea of US(all un..)..asking the difference between consciousness and indication to activity's JACKAL(all un..)..

3.
Press : "do you feel you underachieved Mrs Glenol(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "no i can't feel that way can i feeling is only yes no as you know(all burst..)"
Press : "well you started 14 years back the anniversary is a week to go of that journey your first ever that hasn't been repeated in the last 11 years atleast Mrs Glenol do you believe it will happen may be after 3 generations(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "well i can't comment on this cause they are discrete events as you understand but i can tell the only thing that i know is that you need logistics for that by yourself or someone else but mostly it must be desire and that's never about you it's about me there must be desire in me if i wanted to pull out i didn't have to tell anyone anything my bunch would've done that themselves as you subsequently saw(all laugh..lot)"
Press : "well you said many times you didn't know much at all about this profession before you began but over the course of this journey you might've surpassed your mentors in terms of capturing a whole region's attention that too in an extremely rare time for this profession when it's existence was questioned and they weren't there at all"
Dawn(straight) : "well the only one i know who captured any region's attention and any means everywhere is Mrs Melody Sanders Harrison and she did that from this very region(all laugh..lot) cause none touched the feat she did and none have been able to discern how she did what she did so no that hasn't been touched and that height won't be reached in quite a while now i guess(all laugh..lot)"
Press : "but you defeated..(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "firstly in actual terms her last selected compeer went to see the arrangement for next part of the conference beforehand and no more(all laugh..lot) then for the illusion no i didn't defeat her she did it herself completely unbeknownst to her and it was done the same way i did it after my first journey there's a limit for physique to take the pressure of psychic charges and both of us breached it the only one that succeeded from our cases certainly from my case if not my sister's are only Mr and Mrs Blackmore and they didn't make the mistake we did(all laugh..lot)"
Press : "but if you're referring to personal life then it's upto chance we can add from experiences compiled over millenias(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "well the whole point is that part of life but the thing is that unlike my sis i was groomed first hand i knew everything but my desires didn't hence the clash it has nothing to do with what you're referring to on my or her relationship status(all laugh..lot)..or our physical forms for that matter(all laugh..lot)"
Press : "well we're only trying to understand the middle part of your career Mrs Glenol the start was incomparable the end has been impossible(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "well someone with a better preparation before start can do what i did a month before but you see it depends on the bunch and that's all and there too none will surpass my record on the number of gyms and contests and all so no the first was not incomparable it isn't surpassable there's a big difference mathematics would remind us the most by means of self sufficient failure in terms of axioms(all un..)..and the last one too possibility is a very subtle thing compeers it's not impossible again it's just not attainable(all burst..) and the reason is neither my bunch nor i had to do anything here at all it was our pleasure and privilege to be able to have so e good times with our plane agnostic compeers thus it's never attainment but entailment as equanimity isn't available to itself but only it's self again(all burst..).."
Press : "indeed we agree(all burst..) but one thing is still unclear is that in case of Mrs Harrison she never was a travel companion of your mentors and the others who have been are in the gym leader's positions at various cities who travelled at Sinnoh at the time Mr Kazuhiro Ketchum did with his host Daily Hologram(all laugh..lot)..so does it imply anything as to that they made sure you couldn't do it without them and in case of Mr and Mrs Blackmore they weren't what you were at first region and yeah Mrs Harrison did travel with Dr Oak throughout Pasio and Johto doesn't that help her results somehow (all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "well the last i can't answer you when they started i was still in elementary(all laugh..lot) and i had not much interest as you all know about the second Mr and Mrs Blackmore picked what we did later and it was done through a much prolonged span of time hence they had more control over everything Mrs Blackmore bloomed late and when she did none came anywhere near her in terms of matching her except her other half who still only drew as you know..(all laugh a lot)..(all burst..,Drew un..)..anyway jokes aside(all laugh..lot,Seth..hum,Civility!,all un..,Drew and May too un..) Mr Blackmore caught a Flygon as his third ever catch he did have Mr Tony Thompson with him but then he wasn't at the level he was by the end of that journey he's telling that to all who'll listen for the last 18 long years now(all laugh..lot,Genkai and Blossom,Gladys,Seth..Tony Boy,all laugh..lot) and so Mr Blackmore had certainly what it takes to do what i did but he didn't want to do it then he did it himself.."
Press : "sorry for an interruption but did he somehow didn't do it in consistence to his personal life as you mentioned earlier about parity and rest(all burst..)"
Dawn(straight) : "most definitely there's no other reason cause he knew each of the things i knew infact anyone knows those cause they were being published everyday just as i finished which is the single most important reason why my personal life became extremely difficult subsequently(all laugh..lot) and about your first question whether they made sure of our lifelong faithfulness or not i just gave you the answer of that(all laugh..lot)"
Press : "well you've directly stated and Mrs Harrison implied at her Unova journey that you weren't treated well specifically by Mr Kazuhiro and Seth Ketchum and then Mrs Harrison did travel finally with you all at Sinnoh but you were refused at 2 whole regions the second of which is very difficult to comprehend from our part on their actions throughout(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(straight) : "well i wouldn't be alive physically if i was allowed which no matter my wish would've had repercussions in society who don't understand all the intricate nuances of Pokemon Training including researchers and all included the things i've come to know in this journey even Dr Oak i believe didn't know before the Unovan Trouble started 2 years back infact none knew among us now it's public knowledge without the counter which select few can and will know or be given which has been in my case this time(all laugh..lot) but the thing is that it's given to me cause i was told about these there itself by the two persons you mentioned they subsequently only validated themselves at Unova cause that wasn't for learning it was for application it's like death none will listen to our practice or sentiment or life stories there or the fact that i want to look at life once more it's like that the spontaneity there's no knowledge only application which isn't the case if seen closely but that's in terms of self in terms of it's about training and meaning as they've been saying for 41 years now that too constant(all laugh..lot)..so as for that matter no i only understood later their actions as did their own other halves and Mrs Fressia Waterflower Ketchum was traveling throughout Unova and Kalos and I don't need to talk about her so if it was a mystery to her what her other half was doing most definitely it will be to his little sisters(all laugh..lot)..so yeah this lifelong faithfulness benefits people neither the objects nor their practice unless for the later they acknowledge what they want and what they're at present doing so yeah you can say in a way they only made sure i know that i wad their very own much more than spatiotemporal scales can ever define which if certainly i rememberd i would've had an easier journey less wasteful that's all but it all is conjecture now and hence implausible to talk about(all laugh..lot) and as for Melody well her case was much more difficult and different to me but again she admits this all time she should've done what i should've too that is travel with any or all of the people that we were suggested to travel with that or talk with nothing else(all laugh..lot)"
Press : "well about that Mrs Glenol her case we all know your case wasn't so after Hoenn so it must be extremely dangerous what you were exposed to in the name of practices at Sinnoh(all burst..)"
Dawn(straight) : "well you said the word yourselves (all burst..) i turned 20 and found myself alone suddenly with confusions all over so i was talking with people whom i only should've spoken with to use lexicon properly(all laugh..lot) and yes it was dangerous in terms of training it always is dangerous to keep a Spinda even as you know Dr Serena Toganne Tomkins' stories of her co-ordinator days at Unova the two months(all laugh..lot,Serena bursts..).."
Press : "yes we acknowledge that but now what we want to ask you is that how's your relationship with Mr Jerome Georges(all laugh..lot)"
Dawn(smile) : "as good as it gets"
Press : "well he recently said that he had long past the sentiment that you were only presented as such by certain substances and hence afterwards your life was in shambles now he says jokingly that he was so glad that you weren't ok mentally on the day of the Hoenn Contest final(all laugh..lot)..but what we want to say is that Mrs Glenol that in the last 8 months all the acrinonies surrounding you and your mentors and all seemes to have finally dissapread for good for the rest of next generation atleast and we hold this factor down to the in their words eloquence of the Riumina herd there at Oak Labs HQ(all laugh..lot) do you and your other half from first hand believe it or just the fact finally all the Elite4 facilitators has had to acknowledge their works finally after their Hands-On poof of 12,12(all laugh..lot)"
