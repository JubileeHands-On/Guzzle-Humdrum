so you're awake now compeer were you asleep then or just a meaning you will claim accordingly..,then Mrs Fuinoris said i knew no afterlives will be able to save me#..so i said um..are you um.. related to Jubilee Hands-On this name i've heard#..,the reply is(laughing..),Ghostradarkarrigussonor..yeah yeah this one#..,then she said i understood how foolish it was to be afraid of existence not myself it's presence#..now said this horrendous curse the most elusive pokemon came  to me it has no face or something just exists somehow across multidimensional planes has a special spot of respect even among pokemons it's said in cosmology one of the most avoided creatures cause none know why any being will be trapped in this plane of spontaneous intelligence but no essence#..so this brat comes to me i felt was fondling with my heartbeat i felt strange feelings then understood is minutes changing it according to whatever it wants according to whatever it sees#..then after sometimes i'm left alone then this brat says something which Jolly translates as,wonderful compeer you have a system to lean on to just in case you lack one but this regulation is absurd compeer why bother to know if it's there if you're conserved as idea against it being thus why again there the most astonishing..then she says i understood this brat was changing my nerves entirely#..but my ideas and rest were all fine so i understood physique was just mine,countering#..then itself said i felt so relieved then after sometimes this brat thankfully went back but i fell more ill though as much happy now just as mine,countering#..so then she said i felt like 3 year old and jumped Jolly On-Rom in rhymes#..who was saying many things then all woke up and walked in and all the doctors for some reason viciously jumped her saying why they slept so well many of us including other doctors and all spontaneously said countering(all un..long)..and then it was found that all had a relationship to Jolly On-Roam none could stay detached all like it was so maddening even detachment#..then finally Wolfgang uncle obviously was summoned#..who said yeah it was told that Jubilee Hands-On won't come alone this is the first and the most obnoxious installment of situation impossible unless plays out thus on again a situation thus On-Roam,countering#..then the pokemon training and facilitators came said who's that pokemon#..that was the longest visit by a Ghostradarkarrigussonor then who was first discovered the same day Jubilee Hands-On was found by Leading Rock obviously#..Utkirbek m&Odlanier..Oh Human raise the steeled vigilant stock/of the grounded being as then welcome the Reeling Dashing Rock,#.."
Brock(laughing..) : "atleast i was trying to make own living#..but i told first time about my experiences to Mr Cubin who said(laughing..) no no why do you want them separately Brock they are here just as you no more like any#..The Elusiveüêâ,#.."
Cilan(laughing..) : "far better than saying yeah they saw this,no no you mean you want me now to see it(#)..as i'm..the ü¶ä of rationality#.."
Tracey(laughing..) : "atleast i stood separated from those hideous societies#..Brock+Violet&Jennifer..as i'm the ü¶ä of allegory/being jackal of scenery/look at my skills..i'm the ü¶ä of mandatory,#,far better than saying that feeling Trace do you know you only feel when you're no more a case..reasoning#..Cilan..Dashing Rock,#"
Dawn(laughing..) : "and i was left at that brat's whim solely at 17#..alone#..anyway#..then as the diary says it was a mayhem day one then Mrs Fuinoris returned and all were blindly infatuated with them later first ever subscribers batch of Doctor Slate shirts sold by Police this situation is the end of any relative IT to this#..and that day please Daisy you know the best#.."
Daisy(laughing..) : me and Luhum were touring around then one day we were at a posh area where we went inside a garment showroom where suddenly the brats surround us which sort of dresses do you prefer for which sort of occasions#..so we entertained ourselves#..then we come out and these two brats follow us says(laughing..) after listening to you we only didn't understand if confessor ministers will like a shirt signed by say Doctor Slate(all un..long,..Dawn..THAT FEELING,#,Brock too un..)..so#..we said for any information on business obviously you must contact the morality facilitation centres that is the Police thanks#..then of course there's a big clamour on sponsors and all hence the police sold them#..and it became ubiquitous like the abstract dress itself none of any gross part as both are just that feeling#..so#..then it was written in caps and columns the reference never the name as that's for calling ie only to instigate that feeling of cognition in reflexion rest left for judicial reflection ie that feeling of identification#..so thus obviously Doctor Slate shirts are in the myths already#..Viol flower didn't say much strangely about this when asked i was viciously screeched at(laughing..) that crook intentionally feels this annotation to be his despite understanding that the emotion in requires to be his makes him to abuse intelligence from applying to dealing with its how dare that crook try to insinuate to rationality of ownership from cumulatives of authorship#..Ms Volbeat,#,..then# later only Dr Oak doesn't use them only in this plane Doctor Slate himself was the first buyer as it was told(laughing..) competition that feeling#..so Dr Oak doesn't use them as he uses travel suits always as# they are not for personal benefit only professional protectives#.."
